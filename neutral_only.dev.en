"you're counting as catholics people who label themselves as such , but haven't graced a church pew in years ."
"at my parish , i don't know of a single liberal ."
maybe they're hiding from the authentic catholics .
"christianity is on the decline and has been for a long time , do you believe that you could be the reason ?"
the flip side of the coin is that those who say they have no religion are on the rise .
"in 1948 , gallup found that about 91 percent of americans identified as christian ."
that number took a big dip in subsequent decades and continues to decline in recent years .
"from 2007 to 2014 alone , the percentage of americans who identified as christian fell from 78 ."
the europeans created their own problem .
trump was right not to want any part of it .
"its a little over a 100 days of president donald trump infant administration , , every time you see the word democrat with donald trump , its always , always against his agenda ."
if its not a dirty joke ( like these liberal democrats supporters comedians on late night ) its protest of some kind .
"these liberal , secular , progressive atheist democratic party will never accept president trump as our country leader because of their sour grapes hate ."
president trump has accomplished a lot of things for this country in his first 100 days .
"for american jobs , and keeping company from heading out of the country for american is what this president has done ."
"a commercial ad for television was produced about president trump accomplishment , but cnn ( fake news ) , liberal networks abc , nbc cbs will not show it ."
"president trump is for christian values , where as obama was not ."
maybe thats one reason the atheist secular democratic party will not accept president trump agenda .
"that's because with liberals it's all about labels , there d ."
"ra: you first , where are your cites saying it is not true ?"

"seems like we've heard this before , except it wasn't muslims being referenced ."
silk reminds catholics that the problem of disaffiliation is not confined to catholics .
evangelicals and their mainline protestant cousins also suffer from defections .
"although he's correct in saying that catholics and mainline protestant churches have been losing membership , he's wrong to say the same about evangelical churches ."
the pew polls showed them staying level and nort declining .
what is a similarity between the rcc and mainline protestant churches that doesn't exist in evangelical churches ?
"the former have been moving away from traditional teachings ( at least under francis ) , whereas the latter have mostly stuck to the fundamentals ."
"as the article points out , there maybe other factors involved , but this might be one of the more significant ."
"nice try sky but you're obviously using data from other countries to try and paint canadian muslims as dangerous , sharia loving , fundamentalists ."
it's a baseless extrapolation and you have posted no data to indicate that canadian muslims or muslim immigrants to canada share these views in anywhere near the percentages you're trying to peddle .
it's also curious that you don't provide any source for your data you're also making a completely erroneous extrapolation in your second paragraph .
"yes it's crucial to distinguish between ordinary muslims , including those in canada and the small percentage of extremists ."
it's also crucial to distinguish the difference in attitudes and cultures between canada and other countries .
your post does not seem to be criticizing the extremists .
it seems to be using foreign data to vilify muslims as a whole including the moderate ones in canada .
as such it is a gross generalization and worthy of refute .
"please show your work , jd ."

"who reject church teaching on , say , contraception , priesthood celibacy , etc ."
"so your question , who are you to judge ?"
", though rhetorically powerful at first glance , is quite easily deflated ."
"like everyone else , though , i do judge the mental competence of people who take absurd positions , such as calling themselves catholic when they reject catholicism ."
"they commit no moral wrong , so far as i'm concerned ."
but who are you to judge me if i say the world is flat ?
i'd say your judging me to be absurd would be perfectly fine .
"let's say for the sake of argument that i agree with you that both sides are at fault , equally , for the violence that occurred ."
"all things being equal , why is it the default position of those on the right and trumpkins in general , to always take the side of the kkk , nazi's , & white supremacists ?"
"i recall obama , requesting input , action and decisions regarding the health care act ."
"the republicans refused to assist , or support any part in the decision making process as he was trying to work to get health care accessible to the american people ."
"if , this new revised health care is so great , than the politicians and their families involved in the repealing of this act should have the same health insurance coverage ."
an active criminal investigation to begin with .
"if a person holds another person in 'high esteem , it just follows that we hear that person talk about that person often ."

so why is it i can't find anything in recent years where hilary clinton even mentions sanger .
could it be you are exaggerating just a tiny bit ?
"so should the globe , stop forcing posters to reply to comments if they violate the terms is not our jobs ."
if you can't do the job then get rid of the comments section .
people from the left side of things don't like the president calling them out .
president trump just uses twitter to get his opinion out as the media has just gotten over the top against anyone that doesn't agree with their far left liberal agenda .
"every article ( really editorial ) about trump in this paper starts with a derogatory headline , then right off gives a negative paragraph about why trump is wrong , in their opinion , which they always stated as fact ."
this article is a case in point .
embodying his name sake st francis of assisi in the quest for peace and nonviolence in the world .
and embodying the life and teachings of christ in the sermon of the mount when he says blessed are the peacemakers and to turn the other cheek .
people also said jesus himself and his teachings were unrealistic and yet he preached what he preached anyways .
and as vicar of christ for roman catholics it makes sense for francis to embody the pacifism of christianity's founder .
"please define 'success' for this process beyond a simple completion date , and concluding within budget interesting thing for you to say considering you're calling people who eat any meat and yet dare criticize a trophy hunt hypocrites ."

it's time we started exicuting drug trafficers for being terrorist and murder jay cross - your elitist attitude that educations trumps all else s what got our country into the sewer we are in .
what is needed is common sense and not devotion to those wonderful educated leaders we should follow like sheep .
"you and other sheeple like you are the problem , not palin ."
"ignorance is no excuse no , but it will get you elected ."

most of the active shooter incidents that have occurred on campuses were not due to criminal activities .
most all were potentially preventable tragedies involving untreated mental illness .
"research conducted by the national alliance on mental health on mental health on college campuses show that one in four students have a diagnosable illness , 40% do not seek help , 80% feel overwhelmed by their responsibilities , 50% have been so anxious that they struggle in school ."
take a look at the fbi's study of active shooter incidents and you will again see that arming our kids is not the answer .
"-2000-2013 clearly you've never been to africa and seen the squalor , despair and barbaric treatment most free africans have to deal with ."
can you imagine how bad a time slave might have ?
"but after less than 200 years , we abolished slavery ."
its still going on in africa after over 2000 years of it .
so now they're free and their family is free and they will be free from now on .
"those enslaved in africa , will never see freedom , nor their family , forever ."
the inhumanity they suffered at the hands of the tribe that beat their tribe is unspeakable .
"i guarantee you , if you had a choice you would pick america to be a slave in ."
"at least in america , the white ruling class at the time , chose and bequeathed freedom to all american negroes ."
"but no points for that , huh ?"
"just focus on the previous 200 years , that their people sold them into ."
news flash: just because someone starts a business that called fox news doesn't mean it is actually news .
fox news is a conservative mouth piece and most of their half truth or plain false stories are usually debunked with truth and real facts by fact checkers or real news outlets .

nothing like a pending election to speed things on .
my view is that the only reason the religious want to inject their religious views into politics is so that they can use the force and coercion of government to compel people to do what they can't persuade them to do on their own .
"as washington said , government is not reason; it is not eloquence , but force ."
"like fire , it is a dangerous servant , and a fearful master ."
"parents move their children because there is no do-overs , not really ."
"if you want your child to be accepted into a college they apply for , they have to have a consistent performance school record and high level classes ."
they have to have a solid education .
"one thing that did work is our high school basically had high performers in one specific area of classes , with a separate lunch period even ."
"it worked-the high performers continued to perform well , with a very good co high school education and yes , applied for and went on to college successfully ."
ps important to note-if a student is a minority they are given more leeway re grades and testing for college enrollment acceptance .
their grades/tests are 'weighed' differently than the white students .

-- paul i have also not seen a post where anyone states that the inmates involved didn't deserve to be there yet so many people keep referencing that fact as well ?
"what i have seen posted is that the co's involved also broke the law , what happened is not appropriate , the prison system in and out of alaska is lacking in so many areas to say the least , and that rehabilitation is a better option ."
these are the comments i am seeing yet so many are up in arms about them ?
how are any of those statements referencing those poor inmates or that prison should be easy ?

pursuing austerity in a stagnant economy we had the fastest growth in the g7 after the crash .
"program spending increased under the previous government ( hard to call that austerity ) with the largest increase in infrastructure spending in over 30 years , taking infrastructure spending to the highest level in over 30 years ."
"decades of evidence in europe , japan , shows that blind deficit spending doesn't work ."
"ironically your personal example is an example of the austerity under the previous government , not the stimulus of the curr if they ever do “crack down” on illicit growing operations , the result will be a lot of industrial buildings around eugene going up for sale or rent ."
"according to the senate republicans , alaska is getting 24% of the oil revenue ."

"the goal of every one of these opinion pieces is tax us , take our money , make us pay ."
"it is never about what got us here in the first place , or the lies that are told in the legislature that keep us in this budget crisi obama , a constitutional expert , himself stated that daca was unconstitutional the dream act floated about washington and was never passed in 2012 president obama signed off on it nevertheless despite not having the legal authority to do so under the constitution , to change us laws without congress's approval ."
president trump will likely use his pen to cancel obama's un constitutional unilateral action and hand the hot potato back to the congress to do it properly according to the us constitution .
"the congress and senate will scream when the hot potato lands back in their laps , but it was and still is their job let them do the squirming ."
"what about the parents - sending your kid on a field trip to go swimming - all the while knowng the child cannot swim , the parents bear respons it take someone from the far right to see that black on black violence is epidemic ."

what is an assault style weapon ?
99% of gun deaths ( non-suicide ) are caused by non-assault style weapons .
so all this focus on one type of firearm that causes the least amount of deaths while ignoring the causes of the violence is why this is pointless .
what so no one can own an ar 15 ?
i actually thought it was one of her more coherent speeches .
"she tried an early applause-line , which is when she realized she was in a room full of people who didn't like her---luckily , she was in wisconsin , where even the republicans are too polite to boo ."
"more specifically she was in milwaukee , not a trump stronghold , and a lot of her audience were older , educated folks---not the kind that usually go for her brand of you betchya ."
"it's easy to make fun of palin , who seems to be sticking to a style that got big cheers 8 years ago; and she's certainly found a home for that stuff on the trump campaign ."
she played to a tough crowd here; unfortunately most of us are past caring if she learned from it .
"her biggest mistake , and my daughter pointed this out , was mocking them for being at a fish-fry ."
"you don't do that in wisconsin , and i found it typical of the overall tone-deafness of the candidate in question---or maybe just a little spitefulness on her part ."
"news that after hula , belly dancing recently became the # 2 dance , beating out the macarena in hawaii , a certain hawaiian congressman and dance aficionado , considered the international ramifications , and thought , i need to study this hip swaying contender for top dance in hawaii ."

"this fact finding mission to turkey seemed rather typical , business as usual , much like senator mccain's numerous junkets promoting international peace , and aipac daily flying congressmen to israel for free to observe their wall building ."
"free is free , and a perk is an appreciated perk ."

"i witnessed our bishop and vicar-general come in and take out a priest for sinning , nothing criminal ."
"this priest was treated so badly and unprofessionally and certainly not how christ would have treated one of his followers , that he is seeing a therapist for ptsd caused by the action of these two so called followers of christ ."
i will ban against this type of behavior in our church .
there is no room for bully bishops in god's church .
what a fine example of forgiveness they expressed .
this same bishop destroyed pedophile files when he was a priest in another diocese .
"how was he treated for that type of behavior , he was made a bishop to serve in a different diocese !"
a lot of issues still need to be addressed when it comes to bishops .
they need to be held accountable for their wrong actions .
"we all can make mistakes , but bishops are never called out on theirs ."
brooks was a jeb bush kind of conservative republican .
the white trash ( a majority demographic in the us ) under and unemployed went to the polls to support the candidate who addressed their needs .
"five decades of addressing any and all minority positions and needs left little , if any , time to address the lot of the 55 year old edger operator at a mill that closed because they could not longer buy logs or timber ."
the political elite didn't address the clerks replaced by ibm machinery and soft ware .
"there was a build up of at least two generations or more of white trash , lower economic scale , fallen from middle class , americans who had no political voice until trump offered one ."
"i would proffer brooks , et al ."
and so we have what we have .
arrogance lost to attention to detail .
i hope kellyanne can have influence enough to point that out once again .

the bolivian catholics are joining parallel catholic churches .

your entire argument rests on your belief that a non viable fetus is a full person .
you will have to get that legislated because until that happens your argument is a moot point in a secular society .

abortion was not considered murder in the old testament before viability .
"the concept of ensoulment used to have some bearing on this issue , but not since roe v wade ."

"the use of triple parentheses or triple brackets , also known as an ( ( ( echo ) ) ) , is an antisemitic symbol that has been used to highlight the names of individuals of a jewish background ."
the practice originated from the far-right blog the right stuff; the blog's editors have explained that the symbol is meant to symbolize that the historic actions of members of the jewish ethnicity had caused their surnames to echo throughout history .
"[1] the triple parentheses have been adopted as an online stigma by antisemites , neo-nazis , and white nationalists to identify individuals of jewish background as targets for online harassment , such as jewish political journalists critical of president donald trump during his 2016 election campaign ."

that could go for some religion's and not just christian btw all i want for christmas are the dnc servers .
"exactly- there are the dems in dc that threaten everyone to keep them from doing the right thing- especially when it comes to muslims ( they even got to roberts in scotus to make gay marriage legal , without even a bill being written for it , or the law that stands voted out- along with ubamacare ) , and then there are the muslims now that have taken on the crip/blood way of forcing things their way , which is threaten them with death if they do the right thing , which is why in l ."
"the news there wont say what person's skin color is now when they commit crimes , and that is what the muslims did here- threatened everyone in idaho's courts so they'd let these kids off ."
"hey left , wanna go over the full story of that 'glass of orange juice' ?"
"i think the full story is that: a ) the minister wanted to be able to smoke in her room , so against advice of her civil servants , she checked out of the hotel where the conference was being held and checked into a more expensive hotel some distance away ."
"b ) this , apparently , was against the spending guidelines ."
"c ) since she wasn't at the conference , she needed to hire a car and driver , which she did ."
"she also kept the car at the hotel the whole day , either because she didn't care about the expense , didn't thing about it , or just wanted a car there 'just in case' she wanted to leave at anytime ( your choice of motives ) ."
d ) and a glass of orange juice at this other 5 star hotel cost $16 .
but you think all that is pretty trivial .
"say what you will about the other stuff , but i like the ice breaker that will go from coast to coast to coast ."
it's for the youth and i think canada should be spending some money on its youth .
"otherwise , there won't be much to celebrate at canada 200 !"
but we can't question muslims how do you come to this conclusion ?
no one had a problem when she questioned a muslim a few months back .
it wasn't until a few days ago when she made the reckless decision to post some dubious facts about the moa that there was an issue .
the issue was further compounded when she not only refused to apologize for her reckless conduct but denied there is anything reckless about her conduct .
i am watching the kezi 5am news right now and they are reporting that the bank bag found had lotsa money in it .
"like nothing said , the bank spokesman stated there was no money in it ."
the person who found the bag did not open it but said it felt like a brick of money .
now the news just reported that the bank has not offered the person who found the bag a reward this is all extremely poor reporting .
it has never been a secret that smoking is bad for you .
"in the future people will start trials against food corporations , for hiding danger of some ingredients used in processed food ."
"it's only you who is responsible for what you drink , what you eat , what you watch , listen and etc paxima !"
i agree with many of the facts mentioned in your third paragraph .
and i bow to your stated experience with this team concept .
"however , that's not an accurate portrayal of this lobinger model ."
"no plain , in the beginning , is perfect ."
"from what you say in your reply , i get the feeling you haven't read this model ."
it is ten pages long and is quite thorough .
it has a survey of the various priesthoods in the different christian faiths .
the priesthood isn't coming back as we knew it .
there are many good things in this model .
"as cardinal newman said , all things start with an idea ."
"if it is a good idea , it grows and is changed with time until it is accepted ."
"as shakespeare said , is a poor thing but is my own ."
you can also find it on the national catholic reporter .
regarding: the only fact we have is that burke was present in the meeting when boeselager was asked to resign .
"- the surmise is that the bit of information , that francis of rome , authorized boeselager's dismissal , comes through archbraymond , removed from st ."
"louis , dismissed from the apostolic singatura , chaplain to the knights and dames of malta: for how long ?"
i have struggled with alcoholism most of my life .
i have been hospitalized more times than i can count .
"often times , the withdrawl is so severe that it has become life-threatening ."
even my doctor warned me that the withdrawl symptoms can actually be more deadly than the addiction .
"i have lost thousands of dollars , missed time from work and alienated my family and friends ."
alcohol has taken a huge toll on my mental health and ability to cope with even the smallest issues .
there is no effective treatment for alcoholism .
"i've gone to thousands of alcoholics anonymous meetings over the years , but stopped going because i find their program to be very abusive ."
they require total obedience to their religion and those who don't are treated brutally by other members .
"a is only about 1% , which is the same for treatment centres and other recovery options ."
nothing will change until society becomes willing to have an honest discussion about this issue .
veritatis splendor is essentially saint john paul's redux of the syllabii on error by blessed pius ix and saint pius x .
it is a rear guard action in defense of the fantastic natural order and a doctrine of original sin that presupposes the reality of the eden myth .
it would refreshing if pope francis preached a more realistic view of morality - one that existed in the lives of the people involved rather than one based on the old superstitions of doctrine past .
"sins happen to people , not to god or some natural order idealized by the vatican ."
amoris laetitia is an attempt to break us out of that cycle .
"while many of us would welcome a repudiation of faith as superstition , many of the weak of faith , including the four ex-pastors , would not be able to handle it ."
"faith is not loyalty to the church , it is trust in god and his benevolence to people in pain ."
are you still recovering from hillary's election night victory party ?
they and their parents entered into “formal accountability agreements” with prosecutors .
they won't see a dime of their legal costs back .
"you mean trump's right to make money means he won't ban people from countries ( with terrorist ties ) like saudi arabia , egypt , etc  great story ."
"thanks for sharing : )  not hating , just pointing out that the thing president trump campaigned against , special interest groups , is exactly who lara trump has jumped in bed with ."
animals are not entitled to rights .
"they deserve humane treatment , but humans rights , never and that is exactly what these groups are trying to do by elevating animals above humans ."
they are all about total animal liberation .
"as a veteran , i'd be a bit insulted by the pets for vets bill ."
"it's like they are just throwing unwanted animals at them , thinking they will solve all their mental health issues ."
"instead of providing proper treatment , just give them a dog that may have severe behavioral problems themselves ."
this is one of the main reason i would not vote for hrc because she was in bed with the hsus herself .
everyone knows that it is only white people and christians are discriminated against in this country !
ending daca is trump’s cruellest and most unnecessary crisis yet until next week  this isn't anything compared to what is coming after these terrorists attacked us on us soil .
they are terrorists and we are going to get them .
"they rely on trucks , perhaps we should start banning / restricting them ."
i suspect that even the good people of cleveland would agree that the cubs deserved home field advantage in this year's ws .
placing that advantage on the all star game was an interesting idea but ultimately one that didn't work .
"or 30 years of right-wing talk radio i'm quite shocked actually whenever the issue of the senate blocking or refusing to pass legislation for a protracted period comes up , by the number of posters who seem to side comfortably with the senate over the elected members of parliament who sit in the house , and who answer directly to the citizenry ."
"the only thing i can come up with to account for such an odd reversal of democratic allegiance , is that for a significant subset of the population , democracy isn't actually a concept they're particularly comfortable with how else can one explain a willingness to turn over to unaccountable representatives , the power to govern unattached to the power of removal by the citizens being governed ."
it covers that subset of paranoid schizophrenics who have gone before a judge and been -adjudicated- mentally defective due to being a demonstrable risk to themselves or others .
they retain the right of appeal of that finding and can get their rights back .
"that's the key , no denial of individual rights without individual due process ."
"that's the problem with the dems blanket no fly , no buy legislation nonsense ."
"zero due process to be put on , and zero appeal available ."
"i had jewish friends at school , they told the best 'jewish ' jokes ."

i do not hate someone for being successful .
"i liked the article , spread the word to the vot vastly more violence , injustice and dissolution is done in the name of the war on drugs than we'd ever encounter from the legalization of those same drugs ."
"of course , there's also much more military/corporate profit to be made this way , so it's not like we'll ever see the end of it  an extravaganza certainly to highlight their decade of declining sales ."
"there certainly are a lot of them on the road at the moment but perhaps like me , it will be my first and last ."
i found both the dealer and corporate to be unconcerned with my issues after the sale .
this was my first new care upon paying off my mortgage and my first taste of a vehicle with some nicer stuff as well .
"unfortunately , i found that nicer stuff does not necessarily have to work well either ."
did you miss his comments a little over a week ago ?
"when kim starts to appear more sensible then we know we are in deep  they must learn to submit to the authority of the bishop , who is the local voice of rome ."
"their salvation is completely subject to his will , so they need to do as they are told or he can bind them here on earth and then god himself will have no choice but to toss them out with all the anglicans , muslims , rock musicians , new agers , and others who fail to accept the teachings of the one true church ."
"its harsh , but that's the way god set it up , in his mercy ."
researchers is correct and he'll clobber me if i let the cat out of the bag :-p we can indeed build an alaskan gas transport system capable of moving 500 trillion cubic feet for far-far less cost & capex-risk than parnell's experts claimed with their bogus 1950's architecture .
"the new agts will indeed provide plenty of good & fun jobs for alaskans all over the state , from hyder to kaktovik to attu & beyond ."
"the new agts will be much more resilient from a national security perspective , it will not present a big fat juicy target for anybody to try to interrupt more than 10% of the total gas flow to markets ."
"the smaller components are much easier to bring back online in a few hours , instead of waiting weeks to repair the damage done by a daffy dizzy drunk armed with a bottle of whiskey and a rifle ."
"the new agts is very flexible in design , and can easily switch from featuring lng as the main export product over to gtl-products , and even a subsea cng-gasline pure magic ;- )  surely , tfg took a fair decision and no doubt it's a great opportunity for all other firms to end the agreement with kpmg ."
trump is going to destroy this country .
we will be bankrupt and people will suffer .
a teacher was ignoring my son in class and not teaching him because i confronted him during a teachers meeting .
he was only spending time helping the kids who got the class and not the ones struggling .
he admitted this in front of 4 teachers and the principal .
later said he understood my frustration thats why he had his kids in private school .
"how about the math they pushed in elementary and jr high , most of the teachers i talked to hated it but no one wanted to make waves so they just did it anyways ."
when teachers picket for the benefit of the kids instead of their paychecks ill get behind them .
_i don’t see trump’s statement as calling for violence .
-- paul what you suggested is exactly what happens day in and day out .
i've personally witnessed it many times in my so called white privileged life .
what the author of the article is asking for is unconditional handouts .
reparations had nothing to do with it .
i've personally witnessed citizens of the urban core work out of their blight on their own .
i've personally witnessed those same people rebuke others in the urban core that expected a handout because us evil whites supposedly owed it to them .
"as opposed to you and your barking , she is member if the human race , has support from the cg community , and remains superintendent in spite of an over affair driven by a handful of homophobic locals ."
i've wanted to visit this lighthouse since i first spotted it .

it is really great to see your name in print again since that newspaper in juneau couldn't provide you with the audience you very much deserve .
"what was that outfit called , uhhh , errrrr , the juneau junkfire maybe ?"
well i can't seem to think of the name of it at the moment ( are they still in business ?
) some sort of traumatic event must be blocking my limited brain function .
you enrich all of our lives with your writing and i hope to see more of it .
not sure what is meant by the far left leaning slant concept .
"while fox news makes mention of the 97% and the 3% , they do so as if the competing points were equal ."
real journalists who can read and write know this .
i hope that they never cave in to the garbage that is fox news .
and i hope the new adn does not .
"likewise , when trump makes up a story that is verifiable false , and declares everything else fake news , i hope adn does not cave in , and tells it like it is ."
"the best play for the new publisher , however , will be to focus on alaska news , and leave the national fight to the national cesspool media fox , msnbc , etc  david: these are trees ."
the fact is that nation-building always will fail .
there are far too many variables in changing a football team's coach to make any secure predictions about a season .
imagine the far greater one of looking at a country's future after a new regime and attempting to see that ?
the fact is that the us needs to meddle less in the politics of tinderbox regimes: how many times must we be burned to see it ?
petraeus is given huge kudos because of his successful policies in iraq .
but successful only lasted how long ?
"those who say we should have continued , indefinitely , to invest heavily in lives and dollars make the counter argument ."
as far as the shibboleth about a vacuum of leadership: bollocks .
the us leads the world economically and that is where our strength comes from .
continuing to flush money on ill-thought out military adventures harms our leadership by crippling our resources .
petraeus needs to shut up and disappear into a country club .
jesus would have a problem with a group of so called catholics telling another group to give these other people over there something to eat .

you might want to look up the word decency in the dictionary .
it was indecent to detain a child soldier for ten years .
it was indecent to torture a child soldier .
it was indecent to use a confession obtained by torture against a child soldier in a kangaroo court .
it was indecent of the harper regime to acquiesce in these outrages .
apologizing and paying compensation for our failings is the only decent thing to do .
and how well do you understand how islam is actually practiced ?
you do realize that the old testament says to kill all the amalakites ?
"yet , we don't do that anymore ?"
"acfh , nope , he doesn't get it ."
"he's been bent over by them so often , for so long , he doesn't feel it anymore ."
and they still have him convinced it's good for him to get his prostate massaged by them .
"it's his health care , courtesy of the oligarchy ."
i don't really care about plate tectonics or telemetry even if it might or might not have something to do with newsweek's nonsense back in 1975 about the coming ice age .
the worst example of consensus 'science' is the voting by the psychologists/psychiatrists every few years as to what is or is not a mental disease that particular year .
"if it isn't replicable , can't be peer reviewed , and has no predictive value , it is just opinion dressed up--sort of like lipstick on a pig ."
"the media could not help themselves to keep from covering trump , but they were always in hopes that the coverage would lead people away from him ."
each time they heard him say something they deemed as bad they would run to their talking heads to discuss how this would be the end of trump .
"the more they railed about how bad his latest gaff was the more people stuck to him , because the media came to be seen as immoral , corrrupt , and in the bag for the other side ."
"the voters decided to media-lash them , to borrow a term from the former communist wh resident ."
another member of the moral major good grief !
i caught part of one of his shows and my impression was that he'd say anything for money .
"just getting out of bed is a risk , where do you draw the line ?"

"so do you pleasure yourself while imagining this leader , too , galois ."
"very odd and out-of-place and highly incendiary and racist remarks such as this , obamas great at throwing money down the toilet… by lars thoren , makes it into civil comments and push backs along the same lines don't ."

"wow , kind of fun to be on the liberal side ( in quotes because i think catholic right/left divide is silly ) for once ."
these sspx and/or sedevacantist types should post more often .
i miss the ability to use html and edit my silly mistakes ( beyond 7 minutes ) without having to delete and resubmit .
not having a cumulative history and central status site ( e .
"disqus dashboard ) is another significant issue without email notifications active , i sometimes miss replies ."
"i've also had a few submissions rejected for absolutely no apparent reason , while i still routinely see some very uncivil comments remain ."
what an awesome article - kudos to adn for recognizing an amazing performance of an up and coming great seawolf setter !
"here in hawai`i , we need solar and other methods of desalinating sea water for growing food , and rain catchment and condensation practices to extract water from the air for drinking ."
"globally , we need to counter the oligarchs politically , but i suspect that lots of wars over resources will be fought and that many millions will die from war , famine , and disease ."
the best we may be able to do is to do the best we can in our little corner of the earth .
some of the truths about the relationship between israel and america is too much to swallow it appears for some .
my comments which were neutral but pointed about this relationship have disappeared .
it seems some people wish to remain in denial or wish to perpetuate the great lie nurtured by lame street media that 9/11 was the work of terrorists of a muslim lineage .
you mean the revisionist sovereignty fringe history written in the sovereignty fringe handbook .
try reading books in the hawaiian collection at the u of h library .
i enjoy reading books that were written in the late 1800s and early 1900s .
"you know , before all this sovereignty nonsense started in the 1960s after statehood when the polynesians lost their control of the hawaii elections due to the most discriminated groups ( japanese and chinese ) being all allowed to vote from that time forward ."
polynesians like prince kuhio kalanianaole loved democracy and was hawaii's representative to the u .
"congress from 1902 to 1922 , always speaking in favor of full statehood ."
"it's funny how polynesians loved democracy as long as they controlled it , now they want to take the ball and go home because they can't always have it their way anymore ."
kind of like those white supremacists in the southern u .
"that go by the name depicted in three capital letters , eh ?"
use oxiclean to keep those sheets whiter than white .
"in the past three years i have never had the opportunity to sit and talk to the pope francis does not have time for marie collins , but he does have time for kim davis ."
surprised the word authentic wasn't bandied about in the article .
"kinda like me first thing in the morning , when the bathroom mirror cringes ."
"richard , you are wasting your time with the anonymous resistors or maybe they are the anarchists ."
both hide behind masks and their goals are similar .
"the resistors want a civil war and the anarchists want a violent , bloody revolution ."
"both like chaos and do not the true meaning of what honesty , truth , ethics , accountablity , and personal responsibility is ."
so many people today lack the courage and conviction to speak out .
i do understand people's concerns about being real .
there is always a price paid for the right to speak out .
so at one time the jesuits were the opus dei of the 1800's .
could opus dei become the modernizers of the late 21st century ?
odd that my jesuit hs religion teacher was a member of the french communist party and threw out the text book ( ( rather dramatically and literally ) in favor a marxist analysis of the history of the french catholic church .
this was the 1950's but no parents objected .
"and we certainly enjoyed the course , and the dramatics ."
"and by no means let us forget 3500 known lynchings by the kkk , and unknown more that just went missing in the bayous , untold numbers of acts of violence , intimidation , and domestic terror ."
"the acts of those you list are criminal and should be punished ( if they survived ) , but pales ( excuse the pun ) in comparison to the century and half of white nationalist terrorism , the single more prolific terrorist group in us history , exceeding all others domestic or otherwise , combined ."
i have no 'beliefs' - that is really the textbook definition of an atheist .
"i have no need to believe in some mystical being who i need to get down on bended knee to , nor any need to believe in a mythical afterlife ."
"i am quite happy with the here and now and in living the life i have for all its worth , rather than banking on some 'potential' second life ."
"as for researching the bible , i have done it quite extensively , and was raised in the anglican church , before realising what a load of rubbish it all was , so i know how it came to be written and why it was written the way it was - once again , that being one of the main reasons i no longer follow any religion ."
"as someone wiser than me once said: we are both atheists , i just happen to believe in one fewer god than you ."
"when you see why you reject the existence of all other gods , you will see why i reject yours ."
"and feel free to pray for me , but god won't soften my heart , any more than the flying spaghetti monster will soften yours !"
"kag , my wife is african -american and you're right , gospel masses are some of the best !"
"more than 100 street-level systems function safely and efficiently all over the world including 24 in america , and yet hart blindly rejects it without proper consideration ."
"hart objects that “people have to cross in front of the train” along with other false claims , such as a track taking two or three lanes , when it only takes one ."
"the whole point of street level is that pedestrians can safely interact with the system , with lines that run right into the heart of our urban center , with easy boarding that encourages use ."
"it would do great things for our urban quality of life , as we have seen in increasing number of systems worldwide , without destroying the beauty of downtown ."
"as one who opposed the elevated plan for decades , i see street level as the perfect compromise ."
"it will save money , be finished sooner with less destruction , and provide a more useful system , while healing the civil war that hart has waged with our community , bringing peace to honolulu ."
email is mostly not encrypted and so i don't send anything too sensitive through it .
"setting up pgp or something is not that hard , but you might have to educate the recipient on how to decrypt your email which is a bother especially if you just wanted to ask them if they were free for lunch on wednesday ."
and then they'll say this is too complicated just send them a text and you try to explain that's not secure either .
i thought hrc's treatment of her email was totally out of line .
while my email might consist of wanna go out for drinks tonight ?
hers might have consisted of classified information involving national security and the only reason i can fathom for her wanting her own personal server was to hide whatever she said from the record .
just like the original baggage system at dia .
omg a new couple to have drinkies in ottawa .
they will be on the top of all the wannabe's dinner with lists .
"hopefully they won't be here long and have to pay for their basketball tickets bwwaaa taking a simplistic look at the parties currently competing for votes in the south african political arena , can i ( rightly or wrongly ) come to the following view ?"
": *eff - extreme left , racist-based , wants to claim what little is left of the local economy and remove any incentive for investment of any kind ( foreign or domestic ) - result is an immediate economic collapse and isolation from the world world economy; *ff+ - far right , culture-based ( afrikaner ) with a bias towards minority rights ."
there is insufficient support for culture-based politics when there are more pressing economic issues higher up the agenda; *da - right of center but moving left in an attempt to gain additional black voters .
"claims to be non-racist , but still support race-based discrimination ."
"trying but failing to be all things to all voters; *anc - black african party , claims different things depending on the audience , and keeps the masses happy through unattainable promises ."
light tennis shoes for hiking and hunting ?
our israeli masters disapprove this resolution so we had better do as they say .
they need those pesky palestinians out of those lands to build more settlements and make them jewish for a jewish state exclusive of everyone else .
"soon they will have all those palestinians in camps , numbered and neutered , so they can just steal land and resources , but let's turn our heads and look away because the israelis are 'god's chosen' ."
"then if a tsunami hits the area , they'll be wondering why god permitted it ."
um because you chose the destroyer .
in 1974 nixon enacted the 55 mph national limit .
"in short , this synod will be mainly about the existential implications of the worldwide shortage of catholic priests , particularly for sacramental ministry , while maintaining the traditional parameters of that ministry ( such as lifelong clerical celibacy ) ."
the year 2018 is two years away -- how will the hierarchy prepare for this event ?
"unless their preparation includes frank ( and even brutal ) dialogue with young people , both catholic and not-catholic , the synod will have little or nothing to offer the church of the present or future ."
i don't know what the nra's ( or republican party's ) position is .
i'm simply stating first a fact ( people convicted of felonies are already prohibited from owning firearms ) and a logical point ( we'll need a clear an objective definition that can used to to objective prevent people from owning firearms ) .
"if you're willing to define what mentally ill is in a way that can be legally defined and structured for denying gun ownership , then we can have a starting point for discussing that point ."
until then it's just a hand wave to say the mentally ill shouldn't own guns .
"i mean , seriously , how do we actually do that ?"
have everyone in the country tested and put into a database with their mental health rating ?
#judicialreview i think you meant to type moron .
not sure why i alwaze seee thate wurd misppelledd .
: )  this is an offensive comment .
"that your comment will stand and mine will be deleted says more about ncr than it even says about you , incredibly ."
"no wonder the subscriptions and web traffic metrics are falling so markedly and steadily from the sit for sure , trump is crude , spontaneous & not well disciplined ."
"trump's oral deliveries are , too often , not likable , but he speaks for simple gut truths & he represents clear pragmatic american nationalism , versus the liberal statism of clinton ."
the most ominous issue is that of the upcoming u .
trump has listed constitutionally conservative individuals from which he would pick .
"he promises to make the southern border secure , to deal effectively with the islamic threat , to re-negotiate trade treaties for the benefit of the usa , to preserve the second amendment ."
"hopefully , for the good of our republic , trump will survive shooting himself in the foot so often ."
"he's clearly an amateur in political matters , but that is the basis upon which our country was founded ."
our country & the world are in a horrible mess .
clinton will take us deeper into the swamp .
trump is the lesser of the 2 evils in this election .
"some thought republican family values were repugnant , but white nationalist family values trump that ."
yeah let's pile on them accolades/titles as much as we can; i'm sure she'll be able to include these title's on her next job resume .
"i doubt the liberals could care less about this issue , but its election time and they will promise anything to win over voters but i would never vote for them especially after they lied about the hst trump will face resistance with every move he makes ."
"the most persuasive words in this essay by far are: > she is more like a fountain , spewing ugly and mean ."
"confession may be good for the soul , but it's not very popular ."
"pope francis began his papacy confessing his own human weakness , trying to help catholics make their personal good general confessions ."
the confessional is still open maybe a non-believer may heed .
"whether it be a believer or non-believer who confesses to the truth , there is never penance ."
"quickly , bring the finest robe and put it on him; put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet ."
take the fattened calf and slaughter it .
"then , let us celebrate with a feast , because this son of mine was dead , and he has come to life again ."
"he was lost , and he has been found !"
( luke 15:11-32 )  could not agree with you more - he will probably find that ~70% - 80% of these companies are owned by pension funds and fund managers that looks after the savings of ordinary people .
whole article just full of verbose insults to capitalism without one bit of analysis as to the problem with the mining sector - except that white people own some of it .
"childhood obesity and the prescription drug epidemic are much worthier causes for your concern than someone's cheap thrills on a mountain bike in bear country  where were you when the media , blacks , and liberals kept bringing up race every time there's a police shooting ?"
muslims are great islam not so much .
as a landlord i have used their services many times  mahalo to cb board and rui kaneya for all that you are doing to keep this issue from going away !
hawaiians are paying huge taxes that are going into the hands of the corrupt few and need to be aware this l .
i think that hawaii officials should be doing everything that they can to keep our inmates here on the islands closer to loved ones .
most have severe mental problems that land them in jail over and over .
there are proven track records for programs that guide them when they get out but somehow $$ always become a no vote in the end .
"mentally ill people need health care , housing , guidance and monitoring not prison ."
and those services cost less per person than prison time .
the conditions at the jail in hilo are inexcusable .

"if you did not start a violent riot , if you were not yelling “slaughter russians” and “hang the moscowites” , if you did not start to kill and burn the police with molotov cocktails , if you did not depose the government in a violent coup , if you did not force the elected president to flee , if you did not fire and prosecute ( !"
") supreme court justices , there would be no civil war and no division of the country ."
there would be presidential elections of 2015 and the peaceful life would continue .
and now you go from discussion to discussion and blaming russia and putin ?
for helping their own ilk to withstand your oppression and for the desire to live on their land as they want ?
you are out of your little fаscist minds .

"exedus not since the federal government made the saskatchewan model by federal legislation to be a national obligation \ yes health care was a provincial obligation until then striving for equality within the body of christ is hardly paul's prescription here , more like the opposite ."
actually paul is speaking directly to the question of how to achieve equality in christ .
but the method he espouses is radical to the human spirit .
"the way to strive for equality , according to paul ?"
we should each empty ourselves and adopt the attitude of a servant .
we should esteem our fellow believers higher than ourselves .
"if we all did that , there would indeed be the equality in the body of christ that paul describes in galatians 3:28 ."
"and then james explains why the believers of his day , and of ours , fail to achieve this ideal ."
it is because of our selfish desires for dominance and power and gratification .
"these desires exist within all of us , regardless of gender or ethnicity or social status ."

he will still find a way to mess that up .
but they won't car it's also those within the liberal party he drags down there with him who are benefitting from his repetative ethics breaches which is concerning .
i'm quite sure harper would never have been allowed to drag himself or his political cronies on a holiday with any lobbyists who are depedent on our taxpayer's money .
00 glass of orange juice is enough to end the career of a conservative cabinet minister yet the clown prince is allowed to repetatively abuse the voter's trust with these shenanigans ?
bottom line: the arab countries and the palestinians do not want israel to exist .
they have never given israel a moment of peace .

we don't see them perpetrating violence on those arab countries .
colorado is sooooooo coool fer sure !
flat tax is the only way they would pay !
"yeah , no corporation should have to pay for its waste stream ."
there's no way to make corporations virtuous; that's the burden of individuals .
bet half of the local population doesn't pay taxes .
some work off the books while others don't make enough to pay anything but social security taxes .
"if one is self-employed and grosses about $7k a month , the total tax burden is about 50% ."

the falling price of oil is caused by saudi increasing production .
it has nothing to do with 'paid senators .

isis is caused by radical islam not oil prices .
do you think the syrian migrant crisis is being caused because isis is just disagreeable ?
"their not really a threat , just the jv team right ?"
i'd be happy to refute it once you make it .
you are all over the place .
please make a point and try to stick to it .
actual nazis are marching in this country and killing people .
and the response of some is but the blahs .
the point being made is about the hypocrisy of the left .
"the left self-righteously screaming bloody murder about violence coming from the right , while they look the other way when it comes to violence coming from left ."
"' at the very least , we've given them well over 20 million dollars ."
they have a history of filing bankruptcy to avoid paying their debts .
we may never see the fine paid .
their plan to this point was 'get the corporate welfare' and then 'cut their losses' .
"12 recent bankruptcies shows the pattern of how these companies operate , ."
"…get the loans , get the incentives , run up the bills , … ."
"( …or 'reorganize' …so they can start over and do it again , and again ."
"alaska is giving away well over a billion dollars a year , closer to two , in corporate welfare programs ."
"those billions could pay for schools , or road maintenance , or some other alaska need ."
"instead , those billions are going to the likes of these grifters ."
must be nice living in that bunker safe from facts and all intelligent thought .

"a quote from earlier this is just another vivid demonstration of how far removed from an appropriate exercise of the pardon power this was , bauer said ."

the entire event was staged to circumvent justice for the sheriff .

"his biggest job before becoming hc was dc of the dolphins , where they finished 29th overall ."
elway made a huge mistake letting phillips go and the defense will take a step back this season .
i think it's pretty clear what has happened .
quebec has long tolerated muslim extremists and as long as they stayed away from the us nothing was done the americans watched but said nothing .
there's a new sheriff in dc and he isn't going to tolerate quebec or canada being a conduit or launch pad for them .
i'm pretty sure both couillard and our glorious leader were read the riot act by the us after the the flint attack .
"if it happens again expect the border to be made difficult for canadians and canadian products , and that would hit quebec hard ."
canada is playing a dangerous game if it thinks the us is going to sit back and do nothing .
and couillard is simply echoing that new reality .
defender of dogmatic teaching---quite a rarity these days .
there was nothing fraudulent with running a private non-accredited school .
only a jack-a$$ that graduated from a libtard arts accredited school went to trump university after discovering their queer studies education at the accredited university was worth less than a roll of toilet paper in the job market .
trump university was nothing more than an overpriced audible .
com where some schmuck read business books back to dumb democrats that were too lazy to read the books themselves or were too stupid to go to audible .
com for the exact same content !
"thank you , afd for remembering him ."
he's done nothing more than look good in a suit ?
"sounds exactly like trudeau to me  i think that paid admin leave is paid by the employer , not from an employee's accrued leave ."
the employer won't allow the employee to work until the charges are adjudicated .
"if she's guilty , she may be terminated; if not she is entitled to keep her job ."
the burden of compensation is up to the employer - otherwise i'm sure ms crouch would be happy to just keep working .
"i would love to tell you what i think of that but my comments are getting deleted again to nite , and you won't like my reply so why bother to take the time ?"

"i suspect this might be happening - partly - because there is no longer the option to rate comments good or bad , only civil or uncivil ."
"when one cant disagree with a quote s/he denotes it as uncivil , with the risk it is removed ."

"bernie sanders , keith ellison , nancy pelosi , barbara lee , diana degette , jim mcdermott , maxine waters , dick durbin , tammy baldwin … to name a handful in congress ."
"when have they ever moved on a key principle – abortion and gay marriage , to name a couple of the hotter buttons – to forge some manner of compromise ?"
obamacare had some degree of compromise .
it wouldn’t have gotten enough democrat votes without some movement on the details .
"clearly full-blown socialized medicine wouldn’t have come close , and even socialized-medicine-lite didn’t get a single gop vote ."
but guaranteed the above mentioned names would have voted for the broader issue .
it’s a key principle for them .
"( one more time , just because one might be conservative and heritage may lean conservative , doesn’t mean conservatives must agree with heritage on all things ."
"to the extent heritage had an idea similar to obamacare , they were wrong ."
"oh , and nice racist drop ."
)  she is definitely arrogant  yup .
the bishops wanted trump -- now they got him -- let them deal with him .
the church may just have doomed itself .
"it's unending politics in defiance of christ's wishes ( render unto caesar and god's -- thou shalt not kill , bear ."
bare false witness or covet -- the kingdom of earth ) may finally prove too much and far more than it can handle .
"however , we the powerless may pay the far greater price ."
the meek will not inherit and the gop have proven beyond doubt that evil triumphs over good .
if our priests only knew or saw these events they would be appalled .
time will most certainly tell all !
so i wonder how the moratorium on american tanker traffic from alaska is going to work out ?
it's astonishing how many adults don't realize that they might have different circumstances than others .
i think the point of ms .
wente's article is that rich liberals are sometimes hypocritical and used a high rise condo to make that point .
it's the point i was making about the obamas elsewhere in this thread .
white america so every establishment republican supports trump ?
so every republican in congress supports trump ?
please try to keep up roy .
justin trudeau will feel the back of trump's hand if he even attempts a pivot around a nafta issue .
"he'll land laughing like he did in his election antic down the staircase , but mr ."
macnaughton is correct in his advice to attempt a transversal over differences rather than a pivot; i .
", articulate our values , the values of canadians , in terms of generosity and inclusiveness and tolerance , more in the sense of reasserting as canadians our values as they apply to each other , not doing it in a pointed 'we are and they’re not' way ."
"in other words , attempt to traverse différance ( jacques derrida ) rather than emphasize distinct differences ."
but did canada 2020 issue the liberals a charitable receipt ?
if so it is just like sponsorship i don't think you'll find many canadians with such views .
"contrary to popular belief , science and religion are not mutually exclusive ."
"also contrary to popular belief , galileo was not an enemy of the catholic church , which , along with scientists of the day , readily abandoned the geocentric theory for the heliocentric theory once it could finally be proven through science by means of a demonstrable parallax shift ."
you writing style and wording reminds me of a moron that use to post on this site awhile back .
guessing the both of you might have gone to the same school or hung out with the same group .
"you really need to revise that from thousands of renters pay less to thousands of renters who were fortunate enough to have secured apartments 10 - 20 years ago and stay put you do realize that once a rent controlled unit turns over , it is reset to market rates , right ?"
"and , it only works because they were able to lock in those low rents decades ago ."
"if you started rent control right now in portland , land lords would jack up rents ahead of it going into effect ( from levels that are already deemed way too high by most ) , and that would be the rent level you would be locking in long term ."
"not some 1980's or 90's level of rent , which is what you see among a lucky few in sf ."
"also , it definitely would slow down development , and we need more apartments no matter how you look at it ."
"gee , another with his head in the sand ."
when will you people realize mr .
"it was more than his policies , dufus ."
the late comedian rap reiplinger's puka shell tour guide parody was based on campbell's rhinestone cowboy .
it is on youtub voted to remove the police and the police booth ?
"if shouting down anyone who disagrees with the blm with racial slurs ( white privilege ) is voting it , i guess the bolshevik take over of russia was democratic ."
pride should be embarrassed by the thugger that took place .
it is no surprise the many long-time members of pride are considering ignoring this year's parade .
"socialism is a philosophy of failure , the creed of ignorance and the gospel of envy , its inherent virtue is the equal sharing of misery of course , as orwell pointed out , the equal sharing of misery is not quite equal with some pigs more equal than others ."
no if they are immunizing with monovalent hep b vaccine then the first dose is given at 0 months vs when the vaccine is part of a combination vaccine .
"monovalent hb vaccine is the product of choice for children with conditions that require a higher dosage of hb antigen , such as those with chronic renal failure and immunocompromising conditions ."
"in june 2016 , the ministry of health and care services announced that all children in norway will be offered the hepatitis b vaccine ."
"all children born after 1st november 2016 will be offered hexyon , a 6-in-1 combination vaccine ."
"until now , all infants have been offered a combination vaccine that protects against diphtheria , tetanus , pertussis , polio and haemophilus influenzae type b ."
"this five-component vaccine is given at 3 , 5 and 12 months of age ."
the hepatitis b component will now be included in the combination vaccine .
the scheduling of when vaccinations are started can have to do with the vaccine components in multiple component forms .
"rates should be higher given: ( 1 ) excessive household debt , ( 2 ) distortion of financial assets - stocks & bonds ( 3 ) real estate bubble ."
"however rather than normalize interest rates we have , bank of canada wants to take a bit of a pause and assess the impact ( of rate hikes ) , particularly the impact on the currency , is canada a currency manipulator ?"
we the reading public of the news can tell fake news when we see it and over the years and most recently cnn has been on the forefront of fake news dispersal through the media .

"if the right is gullible enough to believe that tax cuts for the wealthy pay for themselves and create jobs , they will believe that tax cuts will pay for the wall ."
how is it possible to consider that the anc will come to the rescue of south africa on some future date when they are the current robbers of our republic ?
"we must not harbor any illusions , the only way to regain our country is through the ballot ."
the corrupt anc has now opened the door for the opposition parties to gain power .
"racial politics will still prevail at the next election , for this the ifp has a major role to play in convincing the rural electorate as a corrupt free and good governance alternative ."
the da to embrace and exceed all the populist policies of the anc .
the da must be viewed as an anc but without the corruption and poor governance for it to be able to attract meaningful black vote .
the public face of the da needs to change completely .
"in the current dire situation we are facing , for all the opposition parties to come together and jointly plan and execute a strategy to relieve the anc of power ."
"no fifty cents this time , comrade ."
i suspect that his illness has mcstains feeling liberated from the unwritten rule that one does not denigrate the country or president while overseas .
he should resign his senate seat and concentrate on his family and himself with what time he has left .
frankly i'm sorry i voted for him in '08 .
"agree wholeheartedly that the law should have the right to dig into cell records in such cases but i can only assume that without a witness giving them the right to dig into the records , it is a privacy issue which would require changes/challenges to the charter ."
and to be fair would open up a lot of other cans of worms as it would massively open up police authority since electronic privacy falls into the same category as physical and allowing them to dig into cell records without a witness would also allow them to enter your home or search your trunk willy nilly .
"well , she has good hair , eyebrows , good facial symmetry , good cheekbones , a good chin and mouth ."

the world needs good thinkers who can express themselves .
"so sad , who are we protecting here for the truth ?"
"it is , relatively speaking , moving in the wrong direction ."
just who are you suggesting we kill ?
isn't it time to talk peace ?
have we lost the ability to negotiate ?

thanks for defining the problem we are having with this debate .
"trump supporters think you just show up at any airport in the world and say i'm a refugee , send me to america !"
and they put you on a free flight paid by us taxpayers .
can we get their name before they get off the plane ?
the process takes years and requires a visa and extensive vetting .
trump's ban is just a sop to his bigoted muslim hating supporters and has nothing to do with border security .
seriously where do you come up with this stuff .
i am white and laugh directly in your face and believe me most non whites laugh at you too .
why couldn't they have done it in front of someone with an ar 15 extended clip behind the bench seat .
"then we wouldn't have to pay for their jail time , and the fantasy of their rehab ."
"yeah - - because up until now , islamic state really loved the us !"
they love us so much sometimes they cut off peoples heads to keep as a souvenir !
the only artful dodging is your own .
i responded to the only link which provided actual scientific support for your position .
you should be happy about that .
of course i don't consider extremely biased sites to have such value and you shouldn't either .
"until further scientific support for your otherwise unsubstantiated position becomes available , your other points are moot ."
"when it comes to true christian values , most of my christian friends would put compassion at the top of the list ."
ryz seems to organize his list differently .
i was unaware that anyone could make racism respectable .
"i believe , as do actual conservatives , that racism is inately wrong and incapable of being respected , ever ."
"but if you believe it's respectable , as did the democrat party of yesteryear , i don't think it's worth my time debating it with you since you're so incapable of reason ."
"wasn't it bill mahar , one of the kings of the leftist movement , who recently dropped the n word ?"
"you talk about those other things because you're demented , and your rabid hatred of anything and everything moral forces you to assign false motives to your betters who oppose you , your mendacity , your hatred , your immorality and your hypocrisy ."
"we do pray for people like you though , in hopes that god might pour forth his graces to help bring you around to sanity ."
i paid for my daughters education at a christian academy for many reasons .
i believe that we should have the right to choose the teachers and the climate of the classroom for our children .
i wanted my child to say the pledge of allegiance to our flag with the words one nation under god .
i want my grandchildren to have the freedom of thought as they search through the world of knowledge .
why don't we have the vouchers to spend for the education that our children deserve .
you may object to my child wanting to pray while attending school .
i may object to the public school policy towards christian observance according to the american civil liberties union .
we should have the freedom of choice to offer our children an education without political correctness or religious persecution .
"so if six jews had just been targeted and killed while praying in their synagogue , and the incidence of hate crimes against jews was rapidly rising , you would vote against a motion that said: that , in the opinion of the house , the government should a ) recognize the need to quell the increasing public climate of hate and fear; b ) condemn hatred of jews and all forms of systemic racial and religious discrimination on realizing that six jewish canadians had just been massacred and that anti-jewish hate crimes were on the rise , i myself would strongly support such a motion ."
"simply put , if you say you wouldn't support such a motion i don't believe you ."
"state economists and so-called state leaders ( republican majority ) only have to look at southeast alaska during the time period when the inside passage lost its thriving timber economy , which collapsed in 1997 ."
"thousands of people , locals and outsiders , lost their timber jobs ."
"outsiders moved back to their home states , but the born and raised workers stayed put and managed to lick their financial wounds and found less paying jobs to pay their bills ."
"tourism which attracts one million visitors to the inside passage five months out the the year now contributes to the , still fragile , economy ."
a day will come when the floating hotels discontinue their voyages to alaska; then what ?
with what industries that we haven't already exhausted ?
have morneau and trudeau offer courses in setting up testamentary trusts they use which will not be caught by this tax ?
allowing drilling on protected land shouldn't happen .
it's short sighted plan at best and incredibly destructive at it's worse .
the dakota oil has decimated the land and created a boomtown .
now it's a ghost town because the price of oil plummeted and there was not enough profit in it .
this is about making the rich richer .
it's about setting precedent to open more protected lands .
we kick them off their land over and over every time we find oil or gold or whatever else will make a buck .
there are places to drill that is off the coast of whatever 3rd world country .
let the gas companies make a profit without it being on the backs of the poor .
"in 20 years , oil fields will be relics ."
all that is going on is get while the getting is good .

smelling and breathing smoke definitely has a direct impact on me .
"i see the anti-gunners are here with their usual narrative blame the tool , not the user ."
i know the msm has already decided that this was probably false but the complete facts are not all known yet .

i'm suggesting the scc might have some things to say about the rights of institutions versus the rights of individuals .
i think it's been the view in canadian law that institutions don't really have human or charter rights per se but are important in exercising the rights of the individuals who are their members .
they might want to be more specific about how to address the underlying individual rights in this case .
there are lots of issues that have been raised in this case that the supremes may wish to comment on .
the only thing i can say is i'd be totally shocked if they interfered with lsuc's decision to not accredit twu .

follow the postings of the trump supporters .
"they seem to have three general groupings: those who point to clinton and obama , those who claiming trumps is saving america from some unknown , and those who simply like all the turmoil of an administration whose going is to disrupt every aspect of our long history of government by condemning those who do not support them ."
unfortunately it seems those who love the turmoil are leading the pack .
i see very little definitive answers as to what the trump supports actually want .
"i see lots of talking points with no substance: remove all the liberal judges , privatize everything , end all immigration , increase the military and improve highways and bridges while lowering taxes ."
and the list goes on and on like donald's 292 campaign promises .

"@rick tubania: you say that rail is constructed primarily to help the lower income people , but does anyone know how much it will actually cost to ride the rail ?"
a bus pass on a monthly basis is a pretty good deal at $60 .
most of us know that the bus is heavily subsidized .
"also , most of us know that riding rail and taking 1-2 transfer bus ( es ) will definitely cost more than $60 , but we have no idea how much more ."
do you think poor people can afford $100 or $120 a month instead of the $60 they pay now ?
"for some of the working poor , that $40-60 is the difference between having 2 vs 3 square meals a day or even 1 vs 2 square meals a day ."
my point is rail doesn't make sense if those that need it the most can't even afford to ride it .
so my question to you rick is what happens if those that need rail the most can't even afford to ride it because it's too expensive ?
and now back to hawaii there are many residents that already have achieved 100% renewable energy generation of their electrical needs .

"in this case , mr hart said that what you called the black lives matter platform is unadulterated communism ."

the claim that there is a serious uptick in violence against american muslims is pretty much fake news .
"endless stories about the reign of terror against muslims , but have yet to hear of one single muslim -- much less a wave of muslims -- moving out of the united states ."
"it's not as if they get depressed at the thought of abandoning the old ancestral home , where their great-grandparents are buried ."
"if any muslim were at risk of so much as a dyspeptic look from white americans , there's emigration as well as immigration ."
"but to the contrary , we can't keep them out !"
they get huffy and give indignant speeches at the democratic national convention at the suggestion of a mere pause in muslim immigration .
"i agree that business people as a general rule dislike turmoil , especially small business people ."
"unless , as so often there is , a profit can be made from it ."
"the wealthy , purveyors of conservatism and owners of the republican party , the former being half-baked excuses for greed and corruption while the latter is the tool of implementing an agenda of greed and corruption , create turmoil while attempting a comic high wire act of gulling voters into voluntarily , even enthusiastically , accepting corporate oligarchy and serfdom ."
"and small business people , hating the regulatory bureaucracy made necessary by corporate malfeasance , all too often side with the corporate malefactors ."
"trump for president and art robinson for congress is proof that there is no net under that wire , control was lost and the clowns landed on their heads ."

when in the world did capitalism ever have spiritual and moral foundations in judaeo-christian beliefs ?
"marxism has a much stronger claim on being the heir of the hebrew prophets , and of the author ( s ) and redactor ( s ) of the sermon on the mount ."
"capitalism by the very terms of its function in society destroys virtue and suppresses love , and is all the more hateful for duping many of its practitioners to believe they are being very virtuous and loving ."
"on the other hand , interregional and international commerce is a great good for human beings ."
if only it could be organized without the intrusion of the evils of capitalism !
"the concept of the trade agreement already shows what nasty business capitalists and their politico-puppets can get up to: some partners are of course privileged , and stand in the way of being enriched , while others , equally deserving , are nevertheless shut out ."
"and not rubber stamp pay raises for false excel educated and reasonable comment also , as a commenter below said , setnetters have a mandatory 36 hour closure starting after the scheduled fish period every thursday , regardless of the fish counts ."

rent was ok with adn when they signed the lease so no it's not over priced when you have someone willing to pay it .
my guess is adn will stay as long as it can for free then try to have some liberal program or grant bail them out on yours and mine tax dollars .
once again we find the misuse of homophobia .
a phobia is an irrational fear .
can you prove that jack phillips has an irrational fear of homosexuals ?
our governments have been donating on our behalf for years -- excessively .

politicians have not represented the taxpayer on this disaster and they refuse to admit they are wrong .

he should have attacked trump more .
it would be stupid for the democrats to base their leadership decisions on the propaganda against them by non-democrats .
whether she retains or not depends on whether sanders candidates challenge in safe seats and who wins the contested seats in 2018 .
whether large numbers of seats change hands depends on whether the special prosecutor finds anything and how these findings are resolved .

msw does not like pelosi over abortion politics .

"the religious left is centrist , whereas the left is secular ."
"still , as an original christian leftist , i have not problem supporting democrats - or socialists ."
"despite what the liberal press would like you to think , this sort of event is very rare and not exclusive to the us ."
so why is it people say drugged up and not drunked up .
seems the latter is more prevelant .
i am alright with supporting a candidate of my own choosing as are many other people .
"i am not alright with racism , but obama letting blacks say nigga in the white house defeats what you are trying to accomplish ."
so it goes back to it being black peoples fault in the first place .
"you can't have one people say it and another not that is a form of racism , you're just another example of the kettle calling the pot burnt ."
lisa murkowski is one of five republican senators who introduced a measure that would delay the next steps on repealing the affordable care act by more than a month .
"the senators , in their statements accompanying the provision , said the delay would buy congress more time to work out of the the details of a replacement ."
no repeal without a replacement that provides equal or better coverage than the current law .
"monica , you are so pithy at times ."
i love the phrase a growing number who act like god should believe in them and be grateful for the opportunity .
"so where you been for the past 6 years , rand ?"
this just sounds like a rebranded version of obamacare with some possible improvements ( or not ) .

"if my company bands up with 10 others to create a pool , we're going to demand that each company can only hire young , healthy people to keep all of our rates down ."

babb was not one of them .
"additionally , on drugs is used by you as part of the justification ."

"in other words , this is a petty , vicious attack on the less fortunate ."
"the denver city council is just doing the bidding of their corporate overlords who demand a constant supply of cheap , illegal labor while american working families continue to see lower wages ."
next time you see a homeless family on the streets thank your city council person .
"well he has appeared in about a million selfies , photo-bombed a wedding in vancouver , appeared on the front pages of numerous vapid fashion and news magazines , donned a dizzy array of ethnic costumes and taken part from sea to shining sea in every possible gay pride parade oh yeah , he has also appeared as superman/clark kent at hallow'een ."
what else do you want from the pm of this first world country ?
are you sure you want to use one of your two posts this 24 hours asking this question ?
"lol i come here to defend the rites , rituals , laws , rules , and clergy of the one true church ."
"naturally , any posting to the contrary is meant as a subtle reminder to modernists and progressives that they are wrong ."
"as we all know , the way to bring young people back to the church is to return to the ancient traditions of the church , the latin mass , and a clergy that was set apart from and elevated above the flock ."
fair enough on government efficiency ad tax dollars but we can't forget that our tribunal system was the result of a supreme court decision canada lost .
( back in the mulroney era if i'm not mistaken .
) i would say any attempt to deport migrants without due process would meet the same fate before the courts .
truth ( s ) self-reveals in evolving consciousness .
the life and teaching of jesus is about symbiosis/ love .
the arrogance of me-first-ism is a mindset antithetical to the symbiotic harmonics needed to sustain biological biodiversity .
we need to take seriously jesus' symbiotic gospel of eucharistic altruism .
"globally , we need to be a people faithful to life's common religion and honestly collaborate in context with the universal gospel of symbiotic sacrament ."
diversity of rite was not a reformation era phenomenon .
"although the number of particular and regional rites was expanding in the later middle ages , there had never been a uniform praxis in the latin church ."
"in trying to be as un lutheran as possible , pius' action was actually an historical anomaly ."
i'm trying to find actual quotes from bannon .
i have no idea what he has said .
when he took his oath he stated he'd protect and uphold the constitution .
there is absolutely nothing in the constitution about respecting the flag at football games .
"in fact , i'd suspect the founders would be as appalled as i with the cheap , fake patriotism that you espouse ."
what's preventing americans from forming groups of co-op insurance plans ?
if people can co-op food exchanges why not health insurance plans ?
and true  this is just plain wrong on several levels .
"first , the service member ( sm ) that received any bonus for enlistment or extension ( not in the above story but extension bonuses were a large portion of the overall paid bonuses ) , were told they were eligible ."
they have neither the responsibility nor the proper training to determine if the bonus was authorized properly .
"obviously it had to be authorized because it required a bonus control number on the enlistment/extension form , necessary for payment ."
"second , the senior enlisted person in california received a lengthy prison sentence while three officers convicted of fraud get to pay restitution without confinement ."
we still have preferential treatment and different rules for enlisted and officers .
"finally , even if the bonuses were incorrectly issued the sm should not have to repay a debt from over ten years ago ."
"if the pentagon wants money back then the sm should get the years back or say $10 , 000 for every year ."
the weird selectivity of this legislation makes a mockery of this government and our country's independence .
"oh yeah , give a bunch of scumbags on welfare $$$ ."
the court did not rule on environmental issues .
"i'm not sure that the opening sentence is correct , the supreme court of canada has ruled unanimously that a private ski resort proposed for an area sacred to an indigenous community can go ahead ."
i didn't know that scoc was in the business of project approvals .
that rock now little more than pea gravel .

here's a brief summary of how the practice of calling priests father began and spread: http://bustedhalo .
com/questionbox/when-did-the-use-of-father-become-a-practice-in-the-catholic-church-for-ordained-priests secular ( diocesan ) priests in the united states wore the secular clothing of the day ( when not engaged in sacramental ministry ) and were commonly addressed as mister in the secular communities in which they lived .
"the clerical suit and collar for use in public in the united states , away from the church or chapel , was not required until the third plenary council of baltimore ( 1884 ) ."
"wow , you posted it again , after it was pointed out how silly it is ."
"if they want conservative make believe college they can teach at bob jones univers that you are so pompously arrogant to speak on behalf of all the public , you might consider counseling to address your inflated ego problem ."
some fundamentalist christian religious group must be responsible .
[a]ll of the theological constructs that we have built up around it .
"doing that leads , logically , to no church and no scripture from which to derive anything ."
it becomes a few people ( or even a great number ) following the ostensible teachings of one person without any trust that something greater exists for those efforts .
why should i love another as i have been loved ?
how shall i know that this exemplifies a true teaching ?
what is the purpose of doing so beyond a sort of personal self-actualization ?
"is maslow , then , the latter day jesus ?"
jesus is god or he isn't .
"if he isn't , why bother to follow him ?"
"judaism makes more sense , in that case , and the better way is simply the offering of a prophet ."
"if he god , he came for more that a simple prophet could give us ."
and i am guessing you would like to ban certain rifles that are responsible for a couple hundred deaths a year instead of hand guns that are responsible for tens of thousands .
why don't you care about all the black people killed by hand guns ?
"universal background checks and mental health screenings ( the common sense things libs talk about ) wouldn't have prevented this , or any of the recent mass shootings ."
so why did sessions commit perjury ?
can you please explain your last two sentences sorry i don't get them .
"so , you were against trump when he said he would not accept the results ?"
"start charging a ridiculos fee to move here , our state is already busting at the seams 😭 isn't it ironic that the potus is looking to make tax overhaul his signature achievement when nobody in the public has a clue what he's paid in taxes since 2005 ?"
"my faith is not in the institutional church nor dependent on actions of bishops , priests , nuns ."
"i choose to remain catholic because of the eucharist and deep rich history of theology and many holy , loving people ."
some people trigger losses to offset gains .
i'd rather just pay the taxes on the gain .
i am not interested in making or triggering losses at any time .
for that matter why trigger gains ?
let 'em ride most of the time .
religion isn't the problem extremism is .
"most of the death and destruction caused throughout the 20th century in western society came from extreme political movements , not religion ."
"in fact , those political movements were usually explicitly atheist ."
"realistically , economic development is actually private interest preying upon a public need , and if none , then a private demand otherwise ."
"gov't is to merely regulate development if necessary for public health , welfare , or security purposes not to engage in promoting or restricting development ."
the private free market and demand does that .
gov't is just the arbiter between private business and the citizens .
what has down south got to do with canadian politics ?
"surely you read the papers , and follow the news , and know this is a big issue ."
this wasn't discovered by the opposition nor is it totally driven by them .
you think this isn't a big deal then you know nothing about politics .
"in making his case manning ignores , or at least the article does not mention , the influence of fake news on peoples' opinions and voting preferences ."
"good leadership must include rejection of all fake news and fudging the facts , which both the russian candidate and harper did with great abandon during their respective elections ."
when made during elections they are obviously intended to assist politicians to get elected .
politicians must be held accountable for their lies .
voter mistrust of political systems arises because they are not given the truth .
instead they are fed a diet of misinformation intended to change their opinions and voting preferences .
we should be very wary of people like the russian candidate and also people like manning who seem to think that lying to voters is ok .
"broothor , i can see that you have completed the romance stage of your vocation; and you have been hit with the reality of the situation ."
perhaps you have hit a low ebb in your vocation .
yes you now have the elements in the correct sequence of events but drop a line between the abusing priests/religious and the institutional failures .
"you are part of the 93% priests/religious that were not involved , except some perhaps stood silently by knowing what was happening ."
while the abusers were the 7 .
5% approx; the cover-up involved 80% of the hierarchy from the vatican down .
"they were the decision-makers , who in the cold light of day; opted to protect the institutional priorities and not the victims ."
your vocation is still valid and necessary to society .
it may be an uphill struggle for you but hang in there .
just keep doing what you are doing and ignore the hierarchy .
their credibility is gone; yours is still intact .
do what jesus calls you to do .
you obviously did not know him .
this has never been about easing traffic .
there isn't a study that's been done that shows it does that in any appreciable way .
this has always been about theft .

here's an actual compliment i want to give the oregon electoral system: it's way more efficient than california's .
", while each have certain innovations ."
i found this out when i became interested in a particular race for a california state assembly seat .
two big differences from here: everyone runs in the same primary regardless of party ( except presidential ) ; and the state operates both a same day election and a huge mail-in operation .
"the result of the first is that in many districts , the top two-- who go on to the general-- are of the same party , usually democrat ."
often the favorite gets maybe 2/3 of the vote and a couple others scramble for the leftovers at 20% or so each .
"the incredible results: with all this , it's total chaos ."
hundreds of thousands of votes still uncounted from that recent election !
"many races , mostly for second , still undecided ."
"no they've suddenly realized that if the gop plan is successful , catholic hospitals will be left with thousands of uninsured patients who , by law , they must treat , but won't be able to pay the bills ."
"when it comes to pronouncements by the bishops , follow the money first before you start looking for any reflection of the words of christ ."
"i am trying to find any info i can on the responsibility of the canadian forces with regards to one of their regular forces ncms convicted of an offence , pleaded guilty and has received a jail sentence ."
"this is a family member who was diagnosed with ptsd and is suffering from mental health issues such as ptsd , paranoia and sleep deprivation to name a few ."
he was sentenced on the 17th of november 2016 and it is now the 3rd of december 2016 and not one military representative has gone the the toronto south jail to see him .
he was in the process of a 3b release for his mental illnesses and a ar was going on at the same time .
he was self medicating with alcohol that only enhanced the symptoms and the eventual blow up that has landed him in jail .
he is a serving member who was given his disclosure package days before going to jail .
he is in jail with no meds and support now the cf are ready to just throw him on the street with nothing !
a convicted cf killer received more cf help ?
were any of the ( 18 ) eighteen who did run 'best qualified' ?
-- motley the answer you pretend to not see is what so many millions of voters did: hillary clinton .
-- paul this is the face of trafficking in human labor .
this is the prison ship you have read and seen television and international coverage of .
this does not happen in any other state in the united states but only in hawaii .
"this incident on the open ocean could result in the drowning of the illegally trafficked individuals from the philippines , indonesia , malaysia , viet nam and other places in the pacific ."
they could even be locked beneath the deck and the ship scuttled with no record of the loss of human live .
"why no mayday , the internationally know distress call for life saving ?"
"simple , criminals do not call the authorities for help ."
they would prefer to see their human cargo drown than risk being discovered .
criminals don't call for help please consider that .
boycott seafood until slave labor is abolished in hawaii .
it is the least one can do .
"it is hard to see this pain , criminality and corruption ."
the o‘ahu county democrats are proud of senator hirono's selfless and courageous service to her nation and its people .
still is as far as i know .
actually i think they opened the fishing hole to snagging on the 1st .
loblaw over wal-mart nfl over disney blackberry over apple harveys over wendi mmmmmm yep  just hire the most qualified person for the position .
articles such as this one are pretentious and annoying .
"so , you don't like it ?"
"so if a church provides sanctuary to an illegal immigrant and he rapes another under the care/property of the church , what is the church's moral culpability , and who pays for the grandstanding action ?"
"as a hunter , if i shot a bear with birdshot , i would , best case , lose my hunting license for a good long time , the fines would be large as well ."
"i like the belmont station , and the bar always has really good stuff on tap ."
the part i don't like is the cash or credit scam .
"i'm sure nobody likes to give money to credit card companies , and the machines you have to use to access them , but really , you sell high end suds , and you want every one to pay in cash ?"
"i could understand if you're the asian store on the corner charging 35 cents to use a card for something under 5 dollars , i don't usually carry cash , because i'll spend it , high end beer shops , shouldn't force you , to pay for their card services p ."
getting a doctor is and naturopaths are doctors .
we don't need to import more we just need nds to not be under extended health care anymore .
"eastern provinces actually still have companies that provde benefits to workers , bc and alberta doesn't ."
"eye exams should be back in health care too , privatizing that was wrong ."
i read the same sort of comments ( and worse ) regarding mj stocks a year ago when i bought aphria ( aph ) at $2 .
that's +328% for you serious investors .
the medical side of this holds unimaginable potential .
they don't need a nickel from the budget to build a wall .
it was very clear that trump was going to threaten mexico and they would write a huge cheque .
"donald must keep at least one promise , doesn't he ?"
maybe he can pay for the wall himself and mexico can pay him back .
"highly , hiiiiiighly doubt this is trafficking versus smuggling ."
what even gives you that idea ?
"yup , the american dream because you have to be asleep to think it's real ."
now you are claiming these rebels don't work together and coordinate .
"follow the money , we know who is funding them and where the money comes from ."
"when you're there , have a look in a northerly direction ."
"bc's mountains , lakes , rivers , along with fresh fruit and vegetables to die for ."
small towns with more relaxed and very friendly people .
good deals all year round and hard to beat scenery any time of the year .
btw for those who are still looking for asylum seekers and us immigrants .
"they are getting a bit older , just like me , but there are plenty of them in the kootenays ."
"yes , rumour has it that now there is a new trickle coming in ."
mostly people with a low tolerance for the balderdash presently emanating from the white house .
"in our four years with teslas's modest little cousin , a basic nissan leaf , we have had zero problems ."
"ahmed hussen , minister of immigration , refugees and citizenship , amazing , what an incredible coincidence ."
"an islamic minister in charge of immigration , in favor of letting same people in , and whose choice was primarily to live or travel to the states , not canada but america ."
"hey , the young pm has all figured out , more liberal voters coming his way , money is not an issue , plenty available from the banks its coming from ."
"putin , try anymore land grab and there will be no warning !"
keep the peace and all will be well .
"not mentioned by the globe's editors or meryl streep , is the number of combatants that it takes to produce two violently estranged tribes , incapable of believing anything the other says and the role played by those sad saps suffering from post trump election stress disorder ."
"the msm may have become a touch complacent when indulged by two federal , leftist spending machines north of the rio grande , but things have now changed ."
"shrill tabloid-like rebukes for those who have brought change to the table fill our media pipelines , but not the slightest depth of adaptive reasoning or analysis on the main policy issues of our times ."
"the electoral college was invented to trump such insular reactions , yet still ."
"the msm clings to yesterday's hierarchy , and the delusion that they still control the message ."
blm was started when a hispanic shot a black ?
are hispanics one of the peoples of color ?
"for others , the mer is a small price to pay for the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio that doesn't require a lot of monitoring ."
i suppose i fall into this category .
the vast majority of my investments are etfs ( 80-85% ) the remaining amount is my 'trading' money .
i concentrate on a very small number of stocks ( 1-3 ) and trade them .
i do not have the time nor inclination to monitor 25-30 stocks .
"i addition , owning individual stocks for most people consists of predominately canadian and us equities ."
"this introduces risk in that you are over-concentrated and miss out on the other 45% of the world , especially those in emerging markets where growth is expected but individual companies are difficult to buy and/or research ."
[the article above says it was overbooked .
"] yes , it is noticeably bereft of circumstances such as how it was overbooked ."
"considering how the full flight was already boarded and everyone asked to deplane were already seated it seems that the situation was not foreseen , ie ."
the four crew members being sent were outside of their normal booking expectations .
[it would have been cheaper for united to charter a flight for their crew .
] it would be cheaper than to deadhead four people ?
cheaper than having to deal with an unexpected pr incident yes .
i agree that this was not handled as well as it could have but it seems united is being judged for things outside its control which includes the actions of the airport officer's potential use of excessive force/disregard of protocol .
"how about this this , outsider--how about we call japanese americans and japanese nationals japs again ?"
"it's a shortened version , easier , no big deal ."
"the kids in school now wouldn't mean any disrespect by using the word , no ?"
"there are things in history that still hurt , and the reaction of get over it does not address how they hurt then and how the regurgitation of that ugliness still hurts and resonates today ."
i can tell you that word stings me and i wasn't alive for wwii .
"you may have not grown up understanding that there were people , fellow countrymen , who hated your ancestors , who singled them out as other and treated them as less-than ."
you ignore the history and struggle that some americans have fought and still fight to be considered equal .
instead of grading the kids at school she grades herself !
aww poor kid the us government bought what was call the louisana purchase .
"and all that ground , became states , and the feds did not claim or take some 90% of the lands , and continue to do so ."
"there are some 87 million acres of parks and preserves , taken from alaska with more on the horizon , yet to come  hi michael , i think as far as the bible content and what we choose to believe of its essence in some ways we are just going to not really agree totally and that is a faith choice so that is ok ."
i understand what you mean i just don't believe quite the same way you do about these scriptures .
"even though they were initially written to the jews and are about the jewish people , as a christian , i believe god intended gentiles would come to know and believe in these scriptures too and how they support the initiating of christianity ."
"however , i do believe that both jews and christians have often misinterpreted these scriptures , and often intentionally , to support all the ills you brought up in the end ."
so we are agreed that scripture is often used to wrong ends and certainly our church has twisted it to excuse great wrongs and oppression and bias .
"this is purely my opinion , atf , but those catholics who voted for trump probably do listen to their bishops ( assuming they are still in the pews ) but they also probably hate hrc ."
we'll probably never know if the catholic vote was for trump or against clinton .
"i don't think we can ever underestimate the weight of hate carried by people , fueled by ridiculous far-right gossip and rumors , dating to bill's first term in 1993 and fed like imprisoned veal ever since ."
i suspect those catholics who voted for hrc are progressives who don't much care what their bishop has to say about much of anything .
"when surveyed , i self-report as catholic , but only because there isn't a category for progressive catholic ."
"motley , below is the line from the piece: evangelicals and white catholics sensed real hostility to their institutions from law school liberalism ."
"replace the word sensed with the words , reacted to the and maybe democrats will begin to understand their defeat ."
john mccain and lindsey graham a gay couple of senators .
they have hatred of america in common .
john mccain needed a pardon from nixon to stay out of jail because he was a war crimin there is no such thing as a natural order outside the minds of those who believe in it .
"it is a meme , not a moral reality ."
reality is where people live and where science happens .
gays with a petri dish are as open to children as anyone so there is no invalidity or impediment .
"many of the recent terror attacks inspired by the islamic state were carried out by homegrown americans , not refugees fleeing war-torn countries ."
"marie henein --------------------- not homegrown boston marathon bombers - immigrants orlando , florida - gay bar - june 2016 - afghan chelsea district , manhattan and new jersey - ahmad khan rahami - sept 19 , 2016 ohio state university student - he drove a car into a crowd , stabbed people with a butcher knife - police officer shot him dead - abdul razak ali artan , 18 ( he cited radical cleric anwar al-awlaki ."
"- nov 28 , 2016 come on , pope francis: shut down and excise this fascist clerical cult that has festered and metastasized within the body of christ - now !"
the vatican should suppress these legionnaire cretans just like they did to the jesuits in the 16th century or is the vatican too drunk on the dirty money that the legionnaires funnel into the vatican bank ?
imagine the uproar if some pasty white school principal suddenly announced that the native american images were to be removed and replaced with jfk or lucy stone ( the stoners !
the tribes would most certainly have objected to that .
i wonder who planted the idea that the na mascots were demeaning .
dt may ask jt to cooperate on three areas .
"he will expect canada to agree with the us on immigration , national security , and trade policies ."
the problem is jt seems to be at odds with dt on all of these three key areas .
the great goddess is not the god of jesus or of the catholic church but an idol .
i'm curious why so much misinformation was spread about this .
police who are lgbtq were always welcome there as people-- just not official police as part of the parade .
and of course police out of uniform were welcome to watch the parade as well .
john tory gets kudos for his handling of this so far .
this story shows why trump’s ceo mindset is unpresidential .
he let bannon control his hiring and bannon seems to have hired his stable of deplorables .
it is time for republican leaders to force trump to clean house and put in qualified professionals .
"theoretically , block grants can provide adequate funding if congress does its job ."
"that is not very likely , however ."
this proposal runs on the simplistic desire to limit intergovernmental funding and let states decide how to meet their needs .
"the problem is that some people are more highly favored than others based on immigratio status , skin color , etc ."
"not as long as someone looking for their 5 mins of fame , or to be relevant for even a brief time , can find something to be offended about ."
i have worked in both the private sector and for the state of alaska .
my experiences in the private sector taught me how to work efficiently with very little resources at hand .
"the state is not as efficient as the private sector in ways too numerous to mention in this question , but with that , what would you do to vet each and every process and program currently operated by the state of alaska to ensure it was being managed as efficiently as possible ."
i look forward to hearing your response .
"thank i tell you religious fanatics one more time , telling you to keep your religious private and pray at home is not islamophobia ."
"with all due respect , you don't have to go to taiwan ."
this example is hardly the normal response from even those that are coddled .
"for god's sake , move already instead of talking about how great taiwan is ."
"i know this article is a little dated , but i heard something odd today ."
our union steward came back from a union meeting where he was told don't be surprised if boeing comes at us with an offer by the end of the year to keep the 757 replacement in the puget sound area .
i voted yes last time but this time will be a no without even knowing what it is .
five years before our contract is up - give me a break .
"castration , problem solv less carbon producing unit and obama received the nobel peace prize before he entered office ."
"depending on whom you ask and what time of day you ask it , obama did more to kill terrorists than bush ."
obama was adored by hollywood and mainstream media .
obama was this country's first president with african american roots .
it was and is a major historical event .
"like him or not , it doesn't change that fact ."
is it really surprising that more people wanted to be part of that kind of history ?
we will never have another first black president .
keep trying to use that to promote your agenda of being anti-trump .
i did not support or want him as president .
if trump gets re-reelected in 4 years it will be because he was successful .
i for one hope he gets reelected because that means the country is better off than it is now .
after he denied the will of his constituency as a delegate for the presidential nomination he expects support ?
"in the 2016 presidential election , the white vote was far more evenly split than that of any other major racial or ethnic group ( african-american , asian-american , latino ) ."
so how exactly is this proof of white racism ?
just goes to show that 'projects' are the same the world over .
"freddy , your title suggests you made it to meccah ."
"you should really understand how was islam spread throughout the middle east , north africa , the iberian , asia , indonesia etc years after the death of your prophet ?"
"your people conquered by the sword , forced their religion on folks , focred their language on folks , and blamo you have the egyptian , moorish , grenadian , indonesian , sudanese , and the west african societies all being islamic ."
"every culture has done this , hell yours still does it in darfur , parts of northern iraq , and s sudan ."
but it is only bad when the west does it right ?
doesn't sound like papa franceso is intimidated by any of the cardinals !
sounds like papa francesco can throw a political gut punch when he has to: “virus of polarization and animosity” “contrary to the richness and universality” of the faith community .
“everything and everyone then begins to savor of animosity .
"little by little , our differences turn into symptoms of hostility , threats and violence ."
"” “how many situations of uncertainty and suffering are sown by this growing animosity between peoples , between us !"
"” “the virus of polarization and animosity permeates our way of thinking , feeling and acting , ” the pope continued ."
"“we are not immune from this and we need to take care lest such attitudes find a place in our hearts , because this would be contrary to the richness and universality of the church , which is tangibly evident in the college of cardinals ."
"so if you don't believe in god and you believe that the death penalty is immoral , that's ok ."
but if you believe in god and you believe that the death penalty is immoral; that's not ok ( at least in some quarters ) because now you are imposing your religious views on your fellow citizens .
why would catholics support a line of reasoning that gives more weight to the opinions of those who disagree with them than to the opinions of those who agree with them ?
"asian culture promotes stable marriages/family loyalty , excellent education , not having more children than you can afford , hard work , and staying out of trouble headed to taiwan early next month ."
it blows me away the amount of self accountability the people possess .
the kids are amazing and pride themselves in excelling in school .
oh i sure do love this kiddo .
her kindness and generosity are something rare in a child this age .
anyway - this whole federal government is evil is a charade .
but the military industrial complex is now embedded in our economic and political system .
"the american oil industry , for example , can't exist without military support ."
they're not about fund a fully privatized military that comes close to the power of the u .
military to secure whole regions of the world for their taking .
don't even get me started on agri business .
anything that hinders the advancement of the communist state is spiteful in the eyes of democrats .
it's time to fix it that's all fine and dandy .
her role is not to insult millions of canadians .
hopefully justin will give her a slap down .
"i hope that someone will ask this question , in some form ."
"if i knew a way to submit the question for the consideration of the moderators , i would do that ."
was that muslim lawyer wearing a poppy ?
please post your source to refute my claim .
"nova scotia had , in fact , been very wealthy pre-confederation and was an independent democracy with a responsible government for well over a century ."
it’s greatest mistake was to allow control of its banks and ports to fall into what turned out to be enemy hands .
sounds fishy house r-utah & house r-mich for bipartisan on energy issues like off shore drilling & climate change ?
donnelly college's diversity reflects the college's commitment to providing affordable education to students who might not otherwise have access .
—maria benevento that is not enough .
"readers deserve a smidge of how this “small catholic school in kansas city , kansas , founded by the benedictine sisters of mount st ."
"“god our savior , who wills everyone ."
to “come to knowledge of the truth” ( 1 timothy 2:4 ) .
"blessed be the lord , for he has heard my prayer” ( psalm 28:6 ) , particularly with regard to minority students ."
“not even in israel have i found such faith” ( luke 7:9 ) .
the faithful merit a better understanding of the administration that supports affordability happening .
how about some examples of ways they're putting the client first ?
all i see here is a lot of talk .
there is no comment in the article that says we shouldn't have to do anything .
there are numerous initiatives that i would ( and have ) supported that help reduce ghg emissions .
a broad based carbon tax is one that i and most canadians will not support .
eugeneener said it was 40 years of republicans that was the problem .
so lfs was doing math for 40 years .
that meant he only had two of carter's last years .
"double digit inflation; double digit house interest; gas lines , the iran hostage crisis ."
"you know , his most notable accomplishments ."
"no , kurgan , we need more modernism in the church so that everyone can be happy and gay , at least we can pretend can't we ?"
people will flock to the church when we will pretend that the destruction of sodom and gormorah was a mistake by our omniscient god and that he really accepts sodomy now .
what a wonderful church we will become .
we had better start building mega churches !
"kevin , what is the nature of that authority ?"
"when pio ix realised his temporal authority was irrevocably slipping away ( the papal states ) , he decided to expand his spiritual authority ."
"the result was the 1st vatican council , which purported to be an 'oecumenical council' and which rubber-stamped his declaration of infallibility ."
( only 2 bishops had the nerve to stick around to the end and vote against it .
) v-1 was every bit as stacked as francis's recent synod .
"this ultramontane spirit has , alas , been ascendant ever since ."
"in our own time , we've had a pope who had the gall to presume to change the mass and impose it on the church , and how many bishops stood up against it ?"
( just 2 that i know of .
") it took benedict xvi to ( diplomatically ) correct paul vi's hubris , and to state publicly that the pope can't just do whatever he wants ."
"he also re-established the precedent of the pope resigning , an example which i hope many more popes will emulate--including the present one ."
the century initiative should be forced to have a meeting with our first nations in order to eat that statement about no harmful effects .
i doubt vert much that mr .
borneman was sleeping right on the discovery trail .
i believe the harassment our homeless residents receive from various facebook groups cleverly disguised as socially conscious welfare groups is plenty .
"the homeless , many of them veterans and mentally ill , both addicted and not , are aware that there is no place except our over burdened and time restricted homeless shelter inside the city for them to legally camp or sleep ."
i imagine now that the weather has changed many of them are at their breaking point .
maybe the city should open a empty city owned building for these unfortunate people at least until the weather improves .
well i tried to give you a gracious out just in case you were suffering a bit from your namesake but it seems that you determined to go through with this .
you have a lot of problems with your hypothetical .
"it could have as well been someone inside the dnc that leaked ( was a whistleblower ) no , it couldn't ."
whistleblower protection only applies to fed .
agencies not private organizations like the dnc .
"our laws would presumably protect no , they wouldn't as that would violate the dnc's protected right of assembly ."
think about when the court's found for the boy scouts of america when ousting a gay leader .
"there are just too many differences to make use of your analogy , not just the gov v ."
and the right to assemble protection but also the procedural differences and protections accorded between the primary ( a private organization's internal matter regulated by party bylaws ) and the general election ( a government matter regulated by federal laws and the constitution ) .
"yeah , that would have been an insult to snow flakes ."
"trump is unique , just like snow flakes ."
i really like snow flake and i hope trump has a meltdown like a snow flake as spring progresses .
"as they say , hope springs eternal ."
this was indeed the practice of the early church for a number of centuries .
"this is a small step , but a much needed step ."
"education fads come and go , and another generation of students is left to learn what they need to know on their own ."
step 1 should be to shut down oise and its cadre of professors constantly engaged in a quest for job security .
"step 2 should be to close down eqao , a thinly disguised bureaucracy also busy justifying itself ."
"finally , should one exist , a minister and ministry that could clean up the mess left by a succession of governments that have totally screwed up the education portfolio ."
but thank you for tacitly agreeing that the president's promises are meaningless .
want to trace how felons get their guns ?
allow the atf to computerize and modernize their system .
they are forbidden by law from doing so .
the nra and its cronies in congress have ensured that tracing guns is as hard as possible .
this article from the current issue of gq lays it all out in excruciatingly frustrating detail: the national tracing center is not allowed to have centralized computer data .
"that's been a federal law , thanks to the nra , since 1986: no searchable database of america's gun owners ."
"so people here have to use paper , sort through enormous stacks of forms and record books that gun stores are required to keep and to eventually turn over to the feds when requested ."
"they can use pictures of paper , like microfilm , as long as the pictures of paper are not searchable ."
you have to flip through and read .
free nobel peace prize winner liu xiaobo from the brutality of the chinese penal system .

"how many more people can you shift from paying for it to receiving it before the program becomes unsustainable , which i argue would be worse than it being insufficient ?"
"what really needs to happen , though , is to push the matter back down to a more local level ."
"when people see others in their own community asking for food or their children malnourished , they'll be more apt to support doing something about it , and probably come up with more sensible solutions - like offering only actual food items that are cost-efficient - than simply giving people money to essentially spend as they wish ."
low scorers that paint the white or completely miss need to be in front of you when any real shooting breaks out .
no one has the right to tell you what to do with your body .
and in prayer and examination perhaps in the real presence of our lord in front of the tabernacle we could ask: what do my daily complaints say about who do i say that jesus is ?
"if people heard my ordinary interior dialog during the day , what would they conclude about who i believe jesus is ?"
"our real witness is our interior dialog , isn't it ?"
"that's a more demanding call to unity with god , isn't it ?"
how faithful does our interior dialog ( especially when we are dealing with difficulties ) form an image of jesus christ ?
and i recognize your heterophobic bigotry against homophobes along with your racist misperception of racism .
you're the one who could use some counseling .
your hateful pc pejoratives only reassure me that i'm on the winning team .
there is a good deal of disinformation about luther that abounds to this day ( i .
", he did not nail his 95 theses to the doors of the church , but instead he delivered them to a local catholic authority ) ."
"he was anti-semitic in the extreme , horribly foul and fixated on all things anal , and increasingly loose in his thinking and statements ."
"and in addition , martin luther was a brilliant theologian and professor , a preacher who mesmerized the congregations to whom he preached , and a great lover and protector of children ."
"gee - he sounds like a great many of us ( sans the extremisms ) who are combinations of good and bad , open-minded and prejudiced , devout and profane , virtuous and sinful ."
"luther went too far in almost every way possible , but he was at the same time a highly devoted christian ."
he is worth the new examination that has been forming over the past twenty five years .
one of the - forgive me english - more dumber article from an already marginal rag why are some people threatened by public prayer ?
why do some people want to ban something that doesn't hurt them ?
"if you believe , fine , if you do not equally fine ."
freedom of religion and speech were fundamental to our nations founding .
that we were founded based on judeo-christian principles is unquestioned .
and according to those principals all are welcome to believe or not according to their free will and values .
but that now seems to be lost to political correctness .
your pic of the catholic church near the luxor on the vegas strip evokes francis appearing at an outdoor mass .
[with] the backdrop of the pyramids .
or is it the other way around ?
"whatever the case , i am enjoying your work ."
especially because he was doing such a great job with the hotel with a pretty nasty reput all these violent actions across borders would do nothing except raise the price of oil worldwide .
"thus , fulfilling the real reason for this nonsense ."
no mention of the saudi arabian sources for the funding of all islamic terrorism through legal oil operations .
murkowski failed in all aspects of governing throughout his career except to support his oil monopoly benefactors .
all this diatribe demonstrates is the corrupt aspects of the worldwide oil industry born in corruption and sustained by the corrupt practices and governing control ever since rockefeller .
"this nation needs to be blessed with rational human beings instead of any invisible , useless god figure ."
"global warming is happening- but even if it wasn't our natural environment is becoming so toxic , water is unfit to drink , air unfit to breath and our resources are being consumed and contaminated faster than the biosphere can repair and restore them ."
"our human population is estimated to reach nine billion by 2050 if ecosystems don't crash before then , which will put even more stresses on our natural systems of which all life and economies depend ."
there are several reasons to transition off of dirty fossil fools and no reason to continue on the path of destruction .
the hoax is from the fossil fool industry executives whose sickness and greed clouds sensible and common sense logic .
"nope , it's been on the np too , but surprise , surprise - that paper wants to avoid looking for ways to make the cpc look worse : ) and sure , blame the voter in your last sentence ."
just what the cpc did after the 2015 election .
"that was a real smart way to prepare for the next election , you think ?"
and is this what scheer is doing to avoid looking like a loser ?
"on d-day , when allied troops landed on the coast of france , there were two american beaches , two british beaches and one canadian beach ."
the french had no beach for themselves as the liberation of their country moved on .
the correct term would be we celebrate the liturgy .
"the notion of assisting is rejected by the very word liturgy--leiturgia in greek , which means a public act , something in which everyone participates ."
"btw , mjmchale , your use of the phrase assist at the holy sacrifice suggests to me you do not in fact know in what sense the action of the eucharistic liturgy is indeed a sacrifice , our sacrifice offered to the father; and that sacrifice in this sense is probably the most primordial from of worship ( the word you reject ) in human history , uniting not only christians and jews but also polytheistic paganism and some aspects of animism ."
sacrifice is simply the primordial human form of worshiping god by acknowledging our dependence on god .
the big tent kenney talks about is mostly filled with evangelicals and the oil and gas industry .
a real alliance for the future that is .

"rutte , whose party won the largest degree of support in this week's dutch election , capitalized on his government's dispute with turkey's increasingly autocratic and islamist regime ."
"dutch voters may not have been inclined to vote for somebody like wilders , who's adopted a rock hard line on islam , but they apparently rewarded their incumbent pm for taking a somewhat softer hard line ."

"who better than pope francis and the catholic church to point to an alternative vision i expect the opposition to trump will come , quickly and forcefully , from the church , both from its leaders and from the people in the pews ."
that expectation is a little less certain than the hope that animates it: there will be some cranky culture warrior bishops who cling to trump and excuse his destructive policies .
i expect little in opposition to trump from the bishops .
i believe they helped get trump elected .
more i believe that the usccb is in the hands of the culture warrior bishops and they are pretty much delighted with the outcome .
"oh , they will have a thing or two to say about deportations , and they will say a thing or two about the way african americans are truly afraid of what can happen with bannon as a senior advisor and sessions in charge of the justice department ."
trump's election is an indictment of the usccb .

i find myself more focused and prepared for my work day if i can spend my commute ordering thoughts and planning day while on the train .

who knows how many months were burned up getting leave and then getting a date for hearing .

and that is why the answer to the question of whether a delay is reasonable is so fact specific and why arbitrary time limits are not sensible .

this is being widely reported as an islamist terrorist attack on a gay night club .

thomas tough stand on terror 9/11 was just another battle in a war which started when the us funded the takeover of land in palestine .
"the arabs responded with attacks on embassies in africa , followed by continued takeover of land in palestine by funding from the us , an attack on a us navy vessel , an attack on a factory in khartoum and caves in afghanistan , an attack on afghanistan , then on iraq , libya and syria ."
9/11 was a brilliant attack on a strategic resource of the us - its financial district - which failed .
"btw , i just got a conference call from cnn and msnbc , they wanted me to tell you that you are a racist , and they also heard that you didn't hug 18 muslims yesterday , therefore you are a direct descendant of hitler ."

"of course , it's just costing tax payers more and more each year: nearly two-thirds of people who shop for insurance on the state’s obamacare exchange , connect for health colorado , are eligible to receive tax credits to help pay for premiums ."
"those credits rise as premium prices do , meaning they often work to bring down effective premium increases ."
"for instance , in 2016 , according to a federal report , people nationally who received tax credits to buy insurance saw an increase of $4 per month in what they paid , after taking the credits into account , even as the nominal price of plans increased by $30 a month ."
liberals also continued to dodge questions on whether mr .
"morneau recused himself from internal discussions on bill c-27 , legislation that opposition parties say could be expected to benefit morneau shepell i think the very fact that the liberals clearly think they have the right to duck these questions says everything you need to know about their sense of entitlement ."
of course justin has done this often - remember how he ducked the question of how many times he had talked to the ethics commissioner even when asked more than two dozen times in question period ?

"yes , paul was a pharisee who never left his old conservative ideology behind even when he converted ."
it is very disheartening to live with the fact that the catholic church has not learned its lesson .
for centuries it demonized and dehumanized the jews .
the nazis used the same tactic in their horrific final solution .
now the church is targeting the lgbt community with the same demonization and dehumanization of the past making them somehow less than human just as the jews were less than human .
all reputable and peer reviewed medical and scientific sources regarding homosexuality are not in accord with the opinions coming from the church and its conservative allies .
so straight people have the option of getting married if they refuse to be single .
gay people have no such option except to remain celibate their whole lives if they want to be saved .

lars is now in portland where his show is broadcast .
lars has many extremely large construction companies calling him and asking him to broadcast that they have lotsa jobs available .
they do not care if you have a criminal history or whatever .
"what they do ask is that you show up for work on time everyday , and not be under the influence ."
they have hundreds of jobs available starting at $18 .
"00/hour + benefits , and the construction companies can not even begin to fill all the job openings  private businesses are not in business to lose money is this statement to insinuate the government is ?"
it is only taxpayer money so let's waste it ?

"theilen is a democrat and i might add , one of the best this state has to offer !"
pretty sure the only reason netanyahu attributed this to the da'esh ( isis ) was to get increased sympathy from gentiles .
i seriously doubt this was actually the case .
"da'esh leader abu bakr al-baghdadi as more than once declared that israel was not his group's priority , but rather elimination of the shi'a and other muslims which don't conform to doctrinal and/or practical interpretations approved by the da'esh in order to establish their perverted version of a khilafat ."
this was just another palestinian fighting against an occupying foreign army any way he can .
whether paul wrote hebrews is entirely relevant to your offer of hebrews as evidence that paul thought jesus was god .

most comments seem to support a sexual lifestyle that is a mortally grave sin .

that will never change in heaven .
god will indeed pass judgment on those who lead his children away .

nothing could be further from the truth .

who would ever believe that the da could involve itself in hara-kiri politics at this juncture ?
but it is better to have a coalition govt-feverish as it may be-rather than this kleptocratic rule .
citizens must galvanize for a truly non-racial non-corrupt constitutional democracy that our patriots laid their lives for .

we protect the current president of the united states .
he makes up his own truths and they are a dime a dozen .
but i still wouldn't want any physical harm to come to him .
calling the pope a hypocrite is a demonstration of your own view of reality .
one can be derisive of various religious beliefs without being abusive of those who believe in a higher power .
"for example , young earth creationists laughably believe that the known universe was created by a deity less than 10 , 000 years old ."
"if you want to stop voting for monsters , the libertarian party was founded on the idea that people need individual liberty ."
"all fluoride products have warning labels not to consume , including sodium fluoride , fluosilicic acid , fluoride rinses , and toothpaste containing fluoride ."
most prefer to have the choice in how they want to apply or utilize fluoride .
it is highly unethical to force everyone to consume the medication fluoride added to the water .
"fluoride is more toxic than lead , and almost as toxic as arsenic ."
"if the pro-fluoridation kooks want fluoride , they can chew their fluoride tablets and even add fluoride to their own water ."
"those of us who prefer not to consume toxins do not want toxic fluoride added to our water , and have to spend money and effort to remove it ."
"only doctors should be allowed to prescribe toxins like fluoride , with the age , weight , and condition of the patient taken into careful consideration ."
"with water fluoridation , there is no individualized , tailored prescription of the drug fluoride ."
"fluoride is a cheap , effective toxin ."
it's more an oligarchy with unlimited political bribery than any true democracy .
the real monied interests own both sides although citizens are expected to choose between corporate candidates a or b tweedle dee or tweedle dum .
"in 2016 , their choice was the proud goldwater girl turned democrat v ."
the new york democrat turned republican .
democracy no longer exists in the us - we're not far behind seeing its demise in canada thanks to the actions of our ruling oligarch your premise is truly stupid .
"no one was removing the statue at that time , and the march of the nazis and kkk was through the racially integrated university of virginia ."

"actually , in the debate , hillary clinton ad-libbed some really great zingers , showing witty and confident spontaneity , something her detractors have long accused her of lacking ."
"trump , on the other hand , complained like a child at the dinner table about being held to topic ."
"and no one can accuse clinton of corruption yet deny that trump is corrupt , without hypocrisy ."
"sorry to break the news to you , but after 30 years of detailed investigation , neither federal special prosecutors nor republican-led investigative committees were able to come up with any proof of criminal activity , settling for perjury before a grand jury regarding extramarital sex by the president , that was itself within the law ."
"both clintons have released their taxes and financial statements , while trump refuses to do so ."
"neither you nor anyone else has been able to prove a single charge of corruption against either clinton , yet you and others nevertheless believe those accusations ."
"actually that's not what you meant , as it is entirely different ."

we are considering what trump's behavior tells us about him ( about trump ) .
"btw , capital letters don't improve your argument ."
whether with interspersed stops or otherwise .
your perspective is understandably distorted by the violence that you experienced .
but that extreme violence against a person can involve sexual acts does not impact the sinfulness of sexual acts that do not involve violence .
"because sins are acts against god , which can include other people , but not necessarily so ."
and sins against god ( look at the order of the 10 commandments ) alone are the most grave .
"right , you think that's how it works in the real world ?"
the worst bullies i've encountered were in the private sector .
in my case it was in the restaurant industry .
i work in the public sector now .
"yes , i've seen bullying there , too , but nothing like i saw in the restaurant biz ."
"doesn't get much more private sector then that , does it ?"
it's more problematic that we feel compelled to inject our personal politics into every corner of our lives .
at its crudest level it simply means sanctioning everyone and everything you disagree with or makes you feel uncomfortable--as if the other was somehow automatically in the wrong or even inherently evil .
it's ironic that so-called progressives aggressively accuse so-called right-wingers of being biased and intolerant: they're no different .
the only difference is the degree of blinkered self-righteousness and groupthink: progressives dominate the media and academia--for the moment--so they've convinced themselves that they're on the right side of history and morality .
but they're as black-and-white in their views on issues as they accuse conservatives of being .
"it's a question of attitude , not of some set of absolutes that someone has a corner on ."
"as long as we politicize everything , society will be divided into us and them , and aggression and fear will continue to rule ."
i am not a trump fan and i am not a far left liberal or a far right tea partier .
"i voted for mccain yet embraced the obama election in 2008 , hoping for an accelerated yet gradual improvement in all americans relations with each other and further bringing our country together ."
there will always be 5% to 10% of all groups that want it 100% their way .
"as such , and regardless how right it is to make things change as quickly as possible , it still has to be done gradually so that as many americans come on board with the injustices of the past , especially in certain parts of our country ."
the kaepernick kneel was before trump's words and actions made any difference .
can we not move forward and accept the comments and actions about honoring our country as non-racial from 90-95% of americans .
our country is at risk of reversing what progress we have made over the last 150+ years but we have to all trust each person's opinion without inflaming one another .
thank well let's see how trump will embarrass us on this trip smh  i don't think the argument is about making people like gay people .
it's about allowing people to be who they are ( or who they choose to be if that's your ideology ) without fear of persecution or being deprived of basic human rights .
"if you truly subscribe to the notion of 'freedom' that so many conservatives so loudly tout , then it makes no difference whether sexuality s a choice or not ( just as is the case with your religious beliefs ) ."
you can't reconcile the idea of freedom with laws that infringe on those freedoms .
that's not freedom in any sense of the word .
"given your argument however , isn't it equally plausible that the conservative community claims it is not decided by nature but simply individual preference , so they can maintain the force to disenfranchise those people ?"

"i read it over a year ago , as it's a frequent go-to link by the left ."
and welcome to politics on the rest of it .
both parties play the public positioning game to the hilt .
it was his incompetence that led to this day .
#makeharperpay mine went unreported last week .
i came with half-a-second from burying a hatchet into the top of a cow moose's head .
the dog came to the rescue .
the cow had a new calf and attacked 30 seconds after we were retreating .
when are we going to start talking about getting a rail from denver to springs ?
whoever can mastermind would be in the hall of fame .
i started my transportation research company with the express intent of showing that trains can be effective and pay for themselves .
"after doing extensive research i had to admit failure because trains are not effective and , aside from tokyo , don't come close to meeting their costs ."
light rail here is subsidized 74% and riders still complain about the cost .
"using cdot's best numbers , for construction alone we would spend approximately $25 million per month for 20 years ."
"during ski season the trains would be full and still not break even , and during the off season would likely be empty , yet we'd still have to cough up that $35 million ."
"so you are of the view that extremist islam is islam , and anyone against extremist islam is against islam ?"
"bc liberals accused of placing misleading ads in chinese-language newspapers i'm shocked , shocked i tell you , that anyone would think the bc liberal's would do such a heinous thing ."
i mean just look at their record !
"here in canada , i fear that most would fall into the latter category ."
getting independent verification of any tests used is of high importance .
"we must make sure that any tests used are developmentally appropriate , free of racial and ethic bias , and for skills which are of actual value ."
"test the tests , and then test them again ."
students shouldn't be scare off learning by being forced to endure developmentally and culturally inappropriate instruction and tests .
"i don't know , but i always wondered why there are less rational people on the left , like the author of a current article , ethan porter ."
"are they born that way , i ."
last great american: i totally disagree .
"apparently , ​you never heard of oj simpson ."
wow your train of logic runs on some interesting tracks .
note she/he said this: if you harm or hurt my child even with words i would hurt you .
"i don't care about jail and sprout off racial comments to my children without consequences- my guess is the thought of ice showing up at their door or in court makes realdealholyfield mad , and even more horrendous , is threatening people and law enforcement to boot ."
surely one of you is reading here .
might want to pay a visit to this location sooner than later .
but stay safe when you do .
"sorry , the character , morals or lack thereof is hugely important ."
"he has underhanded deals with china , the aga khan , approving gerald butts $140 , 000 moving expenses , supporting his lying defense minister i think there really is nothing more important than his moral compass given it seems to be his biggest issue ."
"no , don't look like it ."
"oh well as you say , why bother !"
muslims have had prayer rooms in the peel board's schools for 20 years and there were no problems until today's wave of anti-islam bigotry hit .
harper started a nasty trend in canada which has exposed some nastiness that i never realized existed here .
which medieval concepts might those be ?
priests are largely ( numerically ) as jekyll/hyde .
"they may advance to a higher position , but they don't change their stripes - up to and including cardinals - and the popes all began as jekyll/hyde priests ."
"pious , as circumstances necessitate , and freewheeling otherwise ."
virtually all priests were viewed as pillars of christian values in the eyes of the pious around them - until they were exposed to be criminals .
law et al so those authors/clerics that roberts quotes may be hydes not yet exposed .
i've seen it too many times .
how many closeted but sexually active gay priests have roundly condemned homosexuality from the pulpit .
"this article is nothing new , mostly claptrap and ends casting blame on the laity for allowing the abuse to continue ."
a flock of sheep doesn't condemn their shepherd when he slaughters one of them to satisfy his hunger .
the sheep have been long and very well domesticated .
sure they do their ongoing division multiply by dividing .
the church isn't an employment agency .
"this just came across the ap: black lives matter activists unveil list of demands to white people: ‘give up the home you own’ so , are all of you progressives going to put your money where your mouths are and give up your homes to black lives matter ?"
"if no , then are you a hypocrite ?"
mccain's behavior since his brain cancer diagnosis is the best argument for term limits i've seen recently .
his time is up; he knows it and knows he won't be running for the senate ever again .
"as a result he's doing what he thinks is right , not what the people controlling his party want , what trump wants , or his big donors may want ."
imagine if the all senators and congresspeople were freed from the need to focus on re-election and could act on the behalf of their constituents ( instead big money donors ) and according to their own beliefs and conscience .
i honestly think republicans are trying to bankrupt the government so that their millionaire benefactors can live the randian fantasy they wish for .
"if they succeed it will be revolution , questionable whether it goes left or right ."
"“despite these changes , the history of public statements continues to provide a convincing case that the purpose of the second executive order remains the realization of the long-envisioned muslim ban , ” chuang said ."
i don't care about public statements and that they present a convincing case that this is a hidden muslim ban .
that does not change the language of the executive order .
"chuang , take your personal feelings out of your judgement ."
does the executive order as it is written discriminant against muslims ?
as a judge it is your job to look at it from an impartial viewpoint .
if you cannot do that and are swayed by public opinion or personal comments then you have no business being a federal judge .
just rough gay sex getting a little out of hand .
this is a divisive issue that should never have been placed before parliament .
"in fact , all that we have seen so far are divisive issues from the lpc ."
"politically , we are divided , with 60 % of voters not represented by trudeau's liberals ."
"geographically , we are divided , with provinces west of ontario/quebec ignored by central canada and its governing liberals ."
"policy wise , we are divided with at least half of the population against substantial immigrations of muslims ."
"policy wise , the pm wants to extinguish our oil and gas industry which divides both the west and east from central canada ."
"policy wise , few want another tax at all and in any event not a useless carbon tax designed to repress and penalize the oil producing regions of canada ."
"policy wise , most canadians want dirty saudi crude barred from entry to canada whereas the pm wants it to continue so as to eliminate the need for energy east policy wise , most canadians do not want canada to sell arms to saudi arabia  yeah , these three serial sexual predators have one thing in common; a lot of money to grab p___y and cheat on their wife ."
"meanwhile in boston , o'malley won't respond to children born of priests , an in-house issue , but will pontificate on this issue ."
needs to put his own house in order first .
"it was obama’s negotiating team that came up with the idea for defense cuts in 2011 , with the help of congress , then obama helped implement the sequester ."
"democrats , meanwhile , didn’t want to see their favorite domestic programs cut and would rather see defense budget cuts instead ."
"yeah , he's a real peach: he signed one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country ."
he signed a bill that made it ok for indiana businesses to discriminate against lgbt customers .
he blocked the resettlement of syrian refugees in indiana — and illegally tried to cut off federal aid to existing refugees .
"blackrock is laughing all the way to the bank , and i'm sure dominic barton is cheering them on ."
these trans-national money-vacuums will never benefit canadians .
from a cnbc article in dec 2013 management consulting firm mckinsey & co .
believes massive sums of capital will be needed to keep up with the world's economic development—and private firms like morgan stanley and blackrock are lining up to make money from the demand .
"mckinsey estimates that $57 trillion of infrastructure investment is needed by 2030 to support economic growth expectations , mostly to finance roads , power and water-related projects ."
"this might sound sacrilegious or goofy , but it has prompted a debate among catholic pals folks here might settle: in today's readings , elizabeth conceived of john the baptist even though she and her spouse believed she was barren ."
"the three options debated , half in jest , all in earnest: ."
john the baptist was conceived through recreational sex .
"john the baptist , like only christ , was conceived through the holy spirit ."
john the baptist was conceived by sexually active parents who wouldn't rule out a miracle .
"excuse if you think it is frivolous , but it has prompted some interesting and surprisingly serious discussion ."
"baird , raitt , kenney , nigel wright , dykstra - all did cash for access which is a globe term for a politician or senior official attending a fundraiser or in the case of wright - hosting it at his home ."
cash for access is simply a slimy way to imply that access was sold without actually stating outright that something illegal happened .
and some of the cpc events were big enough tickets that you would need to be a hypocrite of the first order to say there is a difference .
trudeau has more important things to do like promoting gay lifestyle and same sex marriag we've gone from birther's to hillary's e mails to bill's runway rendezvous with loretta lynch to this .
at some point it needs to stop and we all need to put our big kid pants on and move forward .
honolulu zoo promises go unfulfilled could save a lot of typing by using a fill-in the blank template like honolulu __________ promises go unfulfil the low rate in uk is attracting radicalized muslims by the droves .
"patrick brown won the pc party leadership by flooding the vote with huge numbers of social conservative insta-torys from the evangelical churches , brought in by doctor charles mcvety , and his contacts in the south asian community ."
"since sucking in these gormless so-cons by telling them he was one of them ( anti-abortion , against gay marriage , against the provinces new sex education curriculum ) he has pivoted to a more progressive stance , trying to move the pcs into the middle of the political spectrum , from which governments in ontario are usually elected ."
"his ridiculous flip-flop on the sex-ed letter to constituents in the recent scarboro bi-election exposed , him to his erstwhile so-con allies , as the crass and disloyal opportunist that the progressive wing has always known him to be ."
"brown twisting in the wind , with both wings of the party furious with him ."
he's making tim hudak look like a brilliant tactician and the liberals optimistic .
"the whole idea of deductibles , or co-pays , or any other system for collecting cash directly from the patient , is founded on the idea that when medical care is free people will overuse it ."
there are two errors implicit in that thinking .
"first , the problem of overconsumption of underpriced goods and services requires that the goods and services in question be of value to the consumer ."
"if you are healthy , medical care is of no value to you; indeed , any doctor will tell you that preventive care tends to be underused even though it is free , because it is , by definition , being offered to people who are not sick ."
"second , even free medical care still has a cost to the patient in time , inconvenience and transportation costs ."
"i think i'm like most people; i don't consider a visit to my doctor to be enjoyable , and so i only see my doctor when the anticipated benefit to me outweighs the cost , which is to say , when i need medical care ."
a cash fee per visit would make no difference .
"gary , i research plenty , and unlike others , i do not just rely on partisan hack sites for my information ."
it must give you comfort to say the governor was just saying what he needed to instead of admitting he was thankful for the response from the white house .
"i realize you have a deep hatred for dt , that you espouse he must be mentally ill at every opportunity you get , but try and realize for yourself your judgement , and the judgement of many others is clouded by that hate ."
"you are a victim gary , so many in this nation are in fact victims of the party leaders and the main stream media that has preached the hate for so long ."
"i don't blame you , i just wish you would realize the hate that continues to cloud your judgement ."
"good luck to you , i sincerely hope you find a way to deal with it , if left unchecked , it can lead to more severe mental and physical conditions ."
"by the way gary , look up the time line on puerto rico and the response ."
eugene you say the project was paid for nearly in its entirety by federal and state grants .
could you tell me where the federal and state governments got that grant money ?
taxes collected from the governed ( that's you and me .
"or at least me , i don't know if you pay taxes or not ) ?"
"printed more money , as nothing but the truth suggests ?"
"there's a lot of things i don't mind my tax dollars being spent on , but big , mostly empty buses are not one of those things ."
i keep reading this line about reaves will be terminated over and over .
comon ducks if you're going to term him just do it .
what's the holdup there should be a new coach in his place by now .
note that christians can know of a movie that questions or makes fun of their faith without killing the people that made it .
it's a job for everyone to take on .
the allegations are not of the my feelings were hurt variety .
"some good articles on commonweal , religion section 1 ) a wakeup call for catholic bishops 2 ) reframing religious liberty 3 ) not the time for reconciliation ."
4 ) is the common good obsolete ?
i would like to see more like this .
"good questions are being asked , important points raised ."
"if we had more of it , maybe it would bring greater awareness ."
"but , these types of articles and these issues need to be raised in sunday bulletins , in diocesan news papers ."
there need to be discussion groups among parishioners where subjects like this are discussed - and discussion leaders who keep it from dissolving into the usual political taking sides on the bishops militant subjects and ignoring everything else .
this ncr fills a niche in catholic media that no one else does .
"true , it doesn't do it all ."
"but i want what it does bring - an awareness of what is happening in the catholic world , in parishes and the vatican ."
"i like msw's pieces , his mixed , sometimes screwy point of view makes me think ."
( anyone feel free to show me a republican 'plan' for mental illness treatment ) i think that they have them run for national office .

sure does not take the new immigrants long to figure out how to scam the system and abuse the social system which taxes pay for  this is a bunch of bunk .
i guess i'm one of those fringe people who blame her for killing 80 people in waco .
"what this heap of praise neglects to inform the reader - in fact misleads the reader - is that she authorized a ninja raid on the branch davidian compound , in the middle of the night , with the media fully informed and present , without any attempt to peacefully take david koresh into custody ."
as a local law enforcement officer had successfully done in a previous case - where koresh had been eventually acquitted of murder .
"she got four federal agents , crawling over the roof of the compound , in the dark of the night , killed as the result , giving her the excuse to lay siege to the compound ."
"then she had the nerve to prosecute the survivors , when she should have apologized to the american people and resigned ."
"whether or not they were a cult , the davidians deserved the same enforcement restraint that would have been accorded a mainline religion ."
"oh god , don't remind me of what the rebuilding effort will look like with the opportunity to plaster the word trump on every construction project how about building more homes to be played like chinese checkers ."
"i wonder how many of those stoves are older models that don't have a pipe air source to draw intake air from outside , or are newer , but are unconnected ."
it would be curious to see how just having a stove with a proper intake tube connected might change the health of the occupants .
does a proper connected intake tube reduce respiratory problems from a wood stove ?
"if any researchers from uaf or uaa are listening , it would make for an interesting study ."
"have say , three villages right next to each other ( or near ) that have a history of respiratory issues ( and use wood heat ) , and then set one as a control using their existing wood stoves ( but being studied ) , one that uses newer efficient stoves that do not have a intake tube connected , and the third village has same , newer efficient stoves with intake tube connected ."
"then after studying the effects , have funding already set aside to bump all up to the new stoves ( with or with/out intake connected ) at the end of the study ."
"until the mueller investigation is complete , the russia thing will be hanging around ."
"the press is like a puppy , always on to a new and shiny thing ."
"when information starts leaking out of the mueller investigation , the russia stories will come to the fore again ."
"so , trump is president and @sprezzatura can exercise mean spirit at will ?"
is that the best you can do ?
i sympathize with the point mr .
trump is trying to make but government interference in the marketplace usually doesn't end well .
forcing local and state governments to purchase more expensive project materials for building and repairing will cost the u .
"when uyghur terrorists attack innocent chinese civilians with knives and bombs , the msm like this anti-chinese mouthpiece launches into a root-cause analysis of the region defending the uyghur's right to self-determination ."
"yet when these uyghur terrorists head off to syria to fight for isis , the msm refer to these radicalized people as chinese citizens , not uyghur separatists ."
the msm continues to brainwash western masses with their cold war propaganda .
"i prefer toe national catholic reporter to the national catholic register at this moment in time , because here you can find an arrticle like this which challenges you to think about the christianity of trump's ideology ."
at the register this whole issue is just glossed over .
it is suggested that it is indifferent to the christian that 24 million people will lose their health care under the now failed trump/ryan plan .
as long as one is not forced to pay for contraception !
such indifference to social questions makes one lose one's credibility in the struggle for the culture of life .
"still , being frugal ( and not giving out money on unnedessary things ( contraception ) does help one to have something over for the poor ."
"the author states that quebec worked hard to throw off an oppressive catholic church , which is the media-approved take on it ."
"in fact , if quebec was oppressed by the church they were its most willing prisoner; catholicism used to be seen as integral to their identity , as a way of differentiating themselves from wasp ontario ."
suspect that if you review this vantage point : https://www .
"v=kiikqpmbgvi you'll see that the proper call was , in fact , made , per-fessor ."
if you win an election the last thing you want to do is admit that somebody from outside influenced it in your favour .
"the republicans and donald trump will never say yeah , we shouldn't have won because it was fixed by moscow ."
"i say , maybe the democratic party should stop kowtowing to leftist extremism and start running candidates that are more appealing to the normal americans that live outside the coastal liberal enclaves ."
"i hate to be the bearer of bad news , but the current mad dash to socialism isn't going to work ."
"according to federal data , the most per capita hate crimes in the us are committed by black folks , but that's one of the elephants in the living room the media ignores to keep pushing the nazi-under-your-bed scare story that gets so many idiots to tune in ."
"schatz , look at what your fellow democrats and your prior president barry done about the chinese and the south china seas !"
"schult would put it , i see nothin , i know nothin , absolutely nothin !"

"curiousgeorge the arabs have already recognised israel ------ very curious , george , -------------------- truth unfortunately , israel’s efforts to reach a final accord with the palestinians at the camp david talks with yasser arafat in 2000 collapsed when arafat refused offers for viable , contiguous palestinian statehood ."

other democracies have much better gun laws than this country .
hence they have only a tiny fraction of the murders committed with guns .
the gun lobby has blood on its greedy hands as they continue to make it easy for criminals and the mentally ill to get guns .

the fact they are black makes them tokens you can trot out to show something .
i couldn't eat more than a couple of bites of the corned beef sandwich--it was way too salti more of the same old catechism of concocted right-wing propaganda and smears .
"the right has spent about 30 years and millions of bucks on trying to get some kind of charge against the clintons to stick , and failed miserably , except that all this crap has lodged inextricably in the minds of the gullible , like a legion of clogged toilets ."
it won't take 30 years to expose the real and egregious corruption and endemic immorality of the trump administration .
"i'm imagining two evangelical christian law graduates , each holding the same views on sex and marriage ."
"the first grad comes from the u of t , the second comes from twu ."
their qualifications to be lawyers are equally shining .
"however , lsuc might accept the first but would automatically reject the second ."
why would lsuc engage in such discrimination ?
because it disapproves of a discriminatory rule at twu .
i get it that a portion of lsuc's membership wished to make a political statement on twu's policy .
"and had it just been a statement , no harm would've been done ."
but now harm is being done .
"it will be up to the supreme court of canada to determine which harm , twu's or lsuc's , is the greater ."
"lsuc has tied itself to a position that is legally and ethically questionable , if not hypocritical ."
they'll be lucky if the supreme court bails them out of the mess by ruling against them .
"it seems that you are angry about religion in general no , i'm not ."
"i'm angry when i see people ( ab ) using religion as a justification for demanding specific social policies , despite our fundamental national principle that there shall be no establishment of religion as a basis for laws ."
i see many many claims that mauna kea is a sacred place which must not be desecrated with telescopes; or buried bones are sacred because they have the spirit of the dead person still inside and therefore must not be moved .
"churches are welcome to advocate in favor of harboring fugitives , but their view on this issue deserves no special respect on account of coming from a church ."
a church has no more right to shape government policy than a rotary club -- they have equal rights .
some people think a proposal deserves support merely because a church makes it -- even when the church has no set of definite beliefs about god ( s ) .

"the residents in this area do not want this , but in the name of land development it will happen against their will ."
same exact thing as the rail .
"the residents do not want it going through their neighborhood but in the name of land development and the money attached to it all , it is happening against your will ."
"land developers , investors and others ( caldwell ) who care could care less about what local people want are hellbent on pushing their agenda and special interests ."
i think that your suggestions are good .
"it's just that , so often , members of any kind of church council are approved by the pastor ."
they are usually people who will not make waves .
i find it very hard to imagine most of those whom i know who are on pfc's doing what you suggest .
the one or two members of such councils who would push for those types of actions would soon be shut down by the other members and by other parishioners .
there may be some parishes out there that work like that .
"however , i think that a parish where there was a priest that would embezzle so much money would not be a parish where there was a sufficient number of people to stand up to the pastor and those who support him ."
people who insist on making noise in such circumstances rarely are able to make much headway .
debt to gdp ratio was not substantially reduced .
in fact it has increased by 37% since obama took office .
"as the saying goes , your're entitled to yor own opinion but not your own facts ."
com/united-states/government-debt-to-gdp that depends- you have a cure for stupidity ?
what do you think our current vetting consists of ?
we most definitely vet for ideology .
"we just don't equate that to religion , capitalism , or white culture ."
or think that someone who is willing to petition their government for redress is unpatriotic .
what most people dont know was the makeup of the 'obama coalition' - the majority of whites didn't vote for bo so there was never any hope of a post-racial america .
"i understand reasonable disagreement with his politics but what he faced during his tenure was backlash from whites on a rampage of 'we want our country back' ( read 'uppity n' , how dare you ) and a congress whose goal was to ensure he had 'no wins' even when it was a republican idea ( romneycare ) ."
mo was described by these racists as having a 'certain kind of uppitiness' .
"lets face it , conservatives exhibit a mean/hateful streak ( toward democrats ) that was exacerbated by bo being black ."
"it is clear to any reasonable person that he is classy , dignified , and yes , cool ( if one has a clue what these mean ) but haters are not about to give him that either ."
i would just note the privileged white 'republican' poised to take the office versus how bo carried himself under the onslaught .
"no , he started on that vein with the false assumption that cannabis and prostitution and pornography are somehow caused by each other ."
the three are no more associated than what kind of music you like or where you choose to buy toothpaste .
there is no correlation between legalized cannabis and an increase in pornography studios or prostitution .
"then , he went on to state how shameless his life is and that god favors him and disfavors others ."
"jesus spoke to a lot of people , and the ones he passed judgement to were the ones casting judgement on others ."
"he didn't judge sinners , or decide who's sin is better or worse ."
he taught that we're all sinners and only god is good .
"he didn't try to change sin through law , he tried to change the world through example and love ."
"he taught to love your neighbor as yourself , which means seeing your neighbor as yourself ."
"when people act 'holier than thou' they forget themselves , and the grace that saved them ."

whether you like it or not feeshon poor people tend to commit more crimes than any other class .
inner cities within chicago are predominantly black that's an easy target to pick on but there are cities that are predominantly white or mexican and guess what the same problem occurs you see poor on poor crime .
"in states like nm they have far fewer black citizens but still a very high rate of crime , that's because poverty doesn't have a race; if we filled philly & chicago with poor people of any race & moved all the black people somewhere else you would still have the exact same problem ."
i can't fathom how people are so quick to jump on race relations but can't seem to understand the socioeconomic & population issues surrounding crime .
i'm not black but that doesn't mean i'm unsympathetic to any person believing that they should be able to survive nonlethal encounters with the law .
"folks are lucky just to survive encounters with normal ppl anymore , who wants to worry about cops too ?"

"also , those countries do not all use a single payer programs ."
"finally , i live in the uk and with the exception of those earning 6 figures , the income tax rate is not close to 40% ."
"furthermore , health care takes a much smaller percentage of gdp than it does in the us ."
"that means that health care costs a much smaller percentage of earnings , taxes , etc ."
that means that free access to health care is actually cheaper than it would be if it were all private .
"i have lived under both , and from my perspective , even with all the flaws of the nhs in the uk , there is no comparison , the us system is sycophantic and stupid , but hey it makes some people a lot of money so keep believing their bs ."

don't you see what he means ?
you reject the doctrine and practice in favour of your own personal interpretations of catholic teaching .
ask yourself where do you get this interpretation from ?
most certainly not from the teaching of the popes and councils including vatican ii .
it is a mystery to me and always has been how someone can claim to be a catholic and at the same time reject what the catholic church actually teaches .
"i am not advocating that anyone should leave the church , i am simply asking how it is possible for someone to not subscribe to the tenets of the catholic faith yet say , i am a catholic ."
"it strikes me that it is similar to ethnic , yet non-practising jews turning up at passover because of a cultural attraction rather than out of any religious conviction ."

it was painful to watch to say the least and i’m concerned .
can this demographic actually entice the european students to regress ?
"i understand the reasoning , i understand the view and i understand the entitlement but that does not explain why european students are swallowed by such folly especially knowing that they will automatically be disqualified from participating purely because of the color of their skin ."
why would that level of idiocracy entice european students against all possible logic or even common sense for that matter ?

"well , if liberals want to tick off white voters , then so be it ."
of course you are right in your analyses there is a rather disturbing trend nowadays where people simply deny that the holocaust ever happened .
"ever since the world conference against racism in durban , which was dominated by hatred for israel , the idea that the holocaust is a myth has grown exponentially ."
"old myths about jewish world domination and such nonsense are again rearing it , s head in europe life for jews are becoming increasingly hard and the extreme right , left and muslims are the ones causing concern ."
in south africa one can notice on social media that there is a trend from most races to deny the holocaust and increasingly the holocaust is seen as zionist propaganda and sympathy seeking in south africa some historical issues are dominated by afrocentric ideology which in some cases leads to ideology replacing factual history .
org/6168/jews-canary-coal-min the problem is that they just don't know how to respond because they live in fear .
many priests have lost the ability to empathize with sex abuse victims .
"if they show concern , they are afraid the local bishop will admonish them or place them in a less than desirable church location ."
growing up in the 1950s and early 1960s as catholic kids we were taught to fear everyone .
we feared the priests and the nuns .
we lived our lives in fear .
most priests live in constant fear .
that kind of fear is just like the fear i lived as a child .
i believe that is why most priests today are incapable of dealing with those of us who were abused .

"in my opinion , the people doing the accusing should be providing the audio file ."
it's not fair if someone bombards you with a ton of accusations and you have to provide all the evidence that you are innocent .
the people doing the accusing should prove beyond a reasonable doubt that their accusations are true .
"you were only off by $37 , 000 , 000 in regards to football - and this still hasn't been updated with the pac-12 shared bowl revenue , estimated to be $9 , 200 , 000 for the 2016 year - so let's just call it $45 , 000 , 000 net + revenue ."

here i am in my business of real estate where i must ( required by law ) give out long expensive pamphlets warning of possible lead contamination in homes built before 1978 .
i write contracts with paragraphs that allow buyers to rescind their offer and get out of the deal with no sanction ( money gets returned no questions asked ) if they discover lead or i fail to disclose it .
"there we have two public health doctors , who should know better ."
"promoting the addition of fsa to drinking water , with no way to control dosages , or even really testing content before it's added , which we have shown time and again contain not only lead in measurable quantities but also arsenic and other heavy metals ."

someone needs to explain this apparent conflict to me - i don't understand it .

"but ultimately , trump wins when he pits neighbor against neighbor and he's done an amazingly quick and effective job at ."
"unfortunately , the end result will not be pretty for any of us not in the 1% ."
good samaritan work is not such a blessing .
"the authors of the spirit level showed that an increase in the wealth of a developed country does not lead to better living conditions as this article , and most business articles assume ."
"rather they show that for each of eleven different health and social problems: physical health , mental health , drug abuse , education , imprisonment , obesity , social mobility , trust and community life , violence , teenage pregnancies , and child well-being , outcomes are significantly worse in more unequal countries , whether rich or poor ."
as a country do we want more wealth or better living conditions ?
"what i found truly amazing is that japan , an economic basket case , is tied with sweden as the best place to live , based on the above factors ."
there is correlation between living conditions and income inequality across 23 developed countries .

"that sort of thought is what leads to , e ."

the church teaches and embodies more than the nakedness of its contemporary sinners ( which includes us all ) and its criminals .

"yes , the sequence was as follows ."
"ambrose99: the presumption of innocence does not entail that the accuser is believed to be lying , but that it might be possible ."

anarchists have always been sought-after/welcomed allies of leftist movements .
more doctor bashing by hoskins--not surprising !
"my2centz , if god tells you to do something one way , why would you insist on doing differently ?"
god has a word for that: disobedience .
"jesus never told us to tackle the ills of society , so why do you imagine that is what he wants you to be doing , or supporting ?"
"that's disobedience , whether you are doing it or endorsing it ."
jesus modeled one-to-one ministry in the power of the holy spirit because there is so much we can do to relieve the suffering of individuals .
it is only after we have learned to minister one-to-one in the power of the holy spirit does god give us more power and greater tasks .
"so trying to solve societal ills , whether real or perceived , before you have that experience is a fool's race to failure because you will be disobeying god and doing it without his power ."

put down the ray brown commentary and read a real commentary !
father raymond brown is an approved catholic biblical scholar well respected by his catholic peers and approved by the church .

i am curious as to which scripture scholars you might consider trustworthy ?
"when i was teaching , i recall a counselor telling me that one of our kids needed to attend a school in texas because that school specialized in whatever this child required ( she could not tell me ) ."
"by law , the parents were allowed one trip per month to visit for a week , and each trip cost $7500 including air fare , housing and per diem ."
"services included summer months , too , so $7500 x 12 = $90 , 000 ."
and that total doesn't even include the actual cost of the services provided to the child .
it was just for the parents to visit !
public safety minister ralph goodale says the new centre will help society do as much as humanly possible to prevent radicalization to violence before tragedy strikes .

"if not rail , what flying buses ?"
the state is not planning to build new freeways or roads in the city .
"rail is the only answer , the current system is not near capacity , believe it can double or triple its capacity by adding more cars or larger cars and shortening the intervals ."
like i stated this rail is being built for future use and not only for current use .
rail will be part of a multi-modal transportation system .
it will not supplant cars but reduce the need for cars .
it will allow people who live along the route to do without cars .
those living outside of the line will continue to drive and/ortake the bus .
"the bus system from north shore , windward side , hawaii kai , will continue to have buses running as now ."
the issue will be solved when another site is found .

"[tlingit] , thank you [english] in accordance to measure , hr 4238 , [the measure struck the terms negro , american indian , eskimo , oriental , indians , aleut and spanish speaking individual of spanish descent from those laws and replaced them with asian american , native hawaiian , pacific islander , african american , hispanic , native american and alaska native ."
"] as an federal recognized tribal citizenship , alaska native , i applaud this action by our assigned federal president of united states which governs our federal lands in our states ."
"have a bless day , readers~ once again you have misread and taken one of my comments out of context ."
it's pretty obvious that you don't know how to read and have very poor reading comprehensions skills .
nowhere did i say that a christian extremist group killed 53 people .
i said that since 9/11 there were 21 attacks that caused 53 fatalities  really i could've sworn it was bush that approved the money .
he diverted funds from the tarp to the tune of 17 .
"4 billion in december 19 , 2008 which was a month before obamas inauguration ."
he had to divert the money from elsewhere because congress wouldn't approve .
it was all done under bush and obama simply backed the bailout .
i'm pretty sure that money was paid back from what i remember and a 2 billion gain was had .
obama continued to lend until the final tally was around 80 billion and a loss of 10 billion was reported which will be a net loss to taxpayers as maintenance must be payed on the debt as well as principle .
of course it was all for not at this point .
"we have companies recording half year , half billion dollar credit losses and a subprime auto loan crisis that's just tipped a trillion dollars ."
don't even get me started on the student loan fiasco too or did obama save that as well hahahaha and the chinese are playing little potato for a fool .
"threats , this is another reason why people should own firearms and protect themselves ."
"831 , i believe you need some mental intervention , now  why would i pay the same price for a single beer at a bar as a six pack from the store ?"
"sorry , but your obnoxious music and rude staff aren't worth the premium ."
"places like long branch , though , i go there for the food , not the beer ."
"this is quite similar to the clinton foundation's accepting money from russians who then obtained uranium deposits in north america which required secretary of state approval , as far as i am concerned ."
everyone says there was no quid pro quo and no lawbreaking was involved .
"nonetheless , i was 'concerned' about it ."
off the record contacts occur constantly between governmental agents; the snowden wikileaks gave us records of dozens of such events .
"it is 'legal' , for example , for the nsa to monitor angela merkel's cell phone; the disclosure of that fact was only illegal for snowden , not the nsa ."
"the effect on german-us relations is something to be 'concerned' about , however ."
you forgot to mention that the person shot was about to hand over a bouquet of flowers to a group of soldiers .
did you miss that in the article ?
the steady march to a trumistan dictatorship continues .
"dump this malignant narcissist and delusional , mentally warped sociopath before it's too late ."
wavey: sounds like what they do globally is just like what they do here in the states - make the clinton's rich .
an ethical person would return the money .
"but the clintons are politicians and have no ethics , morals or integrity ."
but what the heck a perfect presidential candidate don't you think ?
alert - fake news - per in order to get the federal grants to run the sjw programs facts - https://www .
"org/blogs/ncr-today/following-money-white-house keys: during obama years , in two years us catholic church received $1 ."
5 billion covering a myriad of projects .
"here is the only direct funding that i could match to *immigrants* - usccb/mrs has received an average of $29 million for each of the last three years in four grant areas of activities , including employment services , economic self-sufficiency and support for unaccompanied children ."
"this is a small fraction of what the church receives - most monies go to overseas , or us catholic hospitals , charities , and universities ."
my wife and i split expenses for several years .
it caused no end of problems until we decided to just pay the bills .
we don't have near the conflict around money anymore .
"similar sort of thing with a mine in bc where they tried to say that speaking chinese was a job requirement , so they could bring in workers from china ."
it only ends up badly for the fools who roll over and hide .
it sounds like the same old thing over and over again .
"by the way , trump apologized for it and was elected president after those things came out ."
which only goes to prove how bad his opponent must have been viewed by a weary electorate .
so you prefer to spend and keep spending on deportations for decades to come rather than spend much less and secure the border so the usa does not have to deport in the first place ?
"like all liberals she is entitled to her entitl unfortunately , god's not talking so that leaves the sinner to do the best they can to make the determination ."
trump is hardly the first president to have his legitimacy attacked .
he led the onslaught on president obama’s legitimacy with his birtherism nonsense .
"but more than any president since richard nixon , trump has shown himself incapable of turning the other cheek and converting doubters into allies ."
"at a time that demands giant leadership , he’s behaving utterly small ."
trump presented such an outlandish and disturbing vision of america on friday that his inaugural address cast more doubt than hope on his presidency .
as long as canada plays identity politics and tribalism there will never be peace .
the french are always about their identity and their separate privileges .
this naturally creates war and conflict with others .
either we have all have special rights for every group or we have no special rights for no groups .
i same no special rights for anyone .
and i think cocaine sells down there in miami like skittles .
maybe just maybe the solution is to cut spending .
"i mean if it is a ratio of liabilities to income , cut the liabilities ."
"maybe if you laid off 2300 state workers like the oil industry did , it might improve the rating ."
you mean the chinese approach to persons who criticize the government ?
"were his lips moving , or his fingers typing ?"
"count me in as someone who still votes in alaska: well done , mr president ."
"of course you are not supporting trump when you speak the truth that the bishops have proclaimed: catholics must support the republican party , which means voting for whomever it runs ."
"this is what the bishops teach us , so it is what jesus would want ."
i hope you preach a sermon on this sunday .
why would we have to mend fences with trump ?
canada-us is strongest alliance in the world .
for that one they deserved it you could have found a hundred let's all help the poor flood victims .
"your choice of emphasis says far more about you , notapenny , than it does about anyone or anything else ."
"ironically , charlie hebdo is a humor and cartoon magazine that mocks all gods equally as an atheistic statement ."
apparently you are as stingy with praise as you are with money .
"now that their debt is 20 trillion mostly because of their military expenditures , the americans want the rest of nato to shoulder a larger part of the expense for a new era of colonization headed by the us ."
"other nato countries , almost all of which are taxed to the tune of 50% to support social programs selected democratically as a way of life by their people , would have to reduce spending on health care , education , infrastructure and other services to meet the us demands ."
the only beneficiaries will be us companies making weapons .
would it not be easier if the americans to get civilized and understand that in the 21st century colonization is no longer possible ?
"the killer must be a good taliban , and turkey is becoming afghanistan ."
"yes , all whites are racists and bigots mark , but nonwhites don't discriminate against anybody ."
the writer and commenters both are clueless .
and comparing christ of the bible to the disjointed voiced jesus of the koran betrays grotesque ignorance of both .
there's an expression among college sports fans for powerhouse teams that pad their win-loss records by playing weaker opponents .
we call that beating up on the little sisters of the poor .
"trump would have no compunction about beating up on the actual little sisters of the poor , either figuratively or literally ."
he'd start by tweeting about how overrated they are .
three convictions for election fraud and you wonder why canadians didn't want harper's party to have centralized power ?
these people could not be trusted to do anything at all .
not even close when comparing to trudeau .
what does the word influence mean to you ?
"i mean , i'm currently watching a series on auschwitz and there's been a fair amount of discussion about how hitler's propaganda - lies - about the jews and other ethnic groups was directed at the german population to get them to believe that jews were inferior beings , contaminating the planet , taking jobs and other resources from the germans , etc ."
"it's accepted that all that hate propaganda definitely influenced the german people and their allies against the jews , to the point of demonizing them and painting them as worthless animals ."
let me get this straight: you don't believe such a campaign against clinton could have ubfluebced people to vote against her ?
"they wear the same brand of asbestos pants , made in china ."
medicinal pot growers deliberately used pesticides banned for human consumption .
"a lot of this is just an excuse to use pot , like winston churchill and others got for drinking alcohol during prohibition ."
"com/wine-blog/winston-churchill-received-a-prescription-for-alcohol-to-get-around-american-prohibition/ um , wrong , wrong and wrong again ."
i have a very reasonable solution .
"let israel annexe the jewish territory of west bank , and let merkel create a pale-stan , in germany ."
that will be right atonement for hitler's misdeeds .
"as a bonus , pale-stan should be a member of eu ."
start working at home with google !
it’s by-far the best job i’ve had .

we cannot continue to legitimize this profession unless the professionals prove they are worthy of legitimacy .
there must be some sort of evidence to support the claims their therapies make .
"there must be some regulatory framework and oversight to reprimand those who practice dangerous unproven therapies , promote dangerous rhetoric , or make unsubstantiated claims about treatments ."
this is essential practice for all properly regulated health care professionals .
why do naturopaths and cam practitioners feel they are above this ethical obligation ?
what they are doing is abhorrently unethical .
wouldn't they have a better legal case if they went after the vendor or the manufacturer rather than amazon ?

there were not obama appointees - they weren't anyone's appointees because these aren't cabinet roles .
they were life-long employees with decades of experi i understand small business concerns with minimum wage and of course companies who offer mc jobs like fast food companies but a bit surprised that magna has a problem with this .
how many jobs at magna are under the projected minimum wage at magna ?
"it took them 8 years , but the union has finally won back the board ."
get ready for higher taxes and union controlled abandonment of charters .
"they wouldn’t say it in the campaign , but the clear agenda is to establish union control of who runs the schools and decides what and how to teach the children ."
how about expedited hearings and deportations ( if baseless applications ) where applicable .

"except for life's natural birth/ death iterations , belief in resurrection is gratuitous , dubious , totally reliant on expectations of divine graciousness - like circumstances of life's dependence on earth substance , on human judgment ."
"former fbi director james comey's testimony had some interesting news; comey leaked his own note from his meeting with president trump - turns out it is against the law to leak government documents ( even non-confidential ) , obama's attorney general loretta lynch instructed comey to not call the investigation into hillary rodham clinton's illegal use of an unsecure private server for confidential e-mails an investigation - close to obstruction of justice , and comey revealed president trump is not under investigation for colluding with the russians ( as the fake news media had reported ) ."
the anti-trump crowd must be very disappointed as there was nothing for them in comey's testimony .
elevating paul to the same rank as jesus now ?
an army sanity board evaluation concluded he suffered from schizotypal personality disorder .
it is very disappointing to learn fringe groups who are out of touch with god's word are allow this power .
our colleges must welcome controversy discussions if we are going to grow as a church .

"remember , our elementary teachers are very busy trying to get sir john a ."
macdonald's name removed from several schools !

hahahahha - lol all of the sarcastic remarks about radical christian extremism are offered in an attempt to get people to think about the fallacy of attributing all violence by committed by muslims or people loosely connect with islam to islamic terrorism .
christians are responsible for the holocaust and christians dropped the atom bomb and christians have exploited people all over the world using some the most brutal means to to accomplish their goals that the world has ever seen .
here in alaska christians decimated native populations thru disease and brutality and raped countless children all the while forcing the christian god on them .
christians bombed the federal building in ok .
i am offering this up because if you want to make a case against christians there is plenty of fodder .
i happen to believe it is a lot more complex than the things i have outlined above .
but never forget there is a strong case to be made against the white devils .
"after jesus had taken the vinegar , he said , 'it is accomplished' , and bowing his head he gave up his spirit ( jn 19:30 ) ."
jesus fulfilled the scripture and the distinct mosaic law at calvary .
kennedy's speech was a wink-wink that he would not take orders from the vatican over ending segregation .
"kennedy , had no problem with jim crow and would not impose catholic teachings on racial equality on white southern baptists who did not want the negro as their equal ."
"quite a kick the truth is , huh ?"
we are also called to be saints .
"and god is not insulted by our attempts to know , love , and serve in our own times----not to be leaning on the past ."
"people who are afraid to 'move out of their comfort zone' and follow christ as today's world needs , are 'tepid' ."
homosexual is not a slur it means person attracted to someone of the same sex .
"it is telling however that you keep coming back to this and find offense in the term ammosexual it simply refers to an attraction to ammo , it is 2016 you are free to love any way you want ."
"back to the point at hand though , if all ammo purchasers pay said imaginary tax then it is possible that some of the actual offenders would also contribute ( for discussion sake i am not mentioning folks who make their own , realistically it would have to be a tax on all components ) ."
only people who fly pay air security tax including terrorists !
are you saying people who never fly should pay too ?
i predicted the result but this was uh's best team this year .
"bigger dogs , longer rests , unharnessing , smaller teams , less inbreeding ."
they are making 35-50 lb dogs do the work that 75 -100lb dogs use to .
the leaving dogs harnessed 24 hrs a day is bad too .
eating and running should br banned also a few hours of rest to digest at least part of the meal should be a no brainer .
eating and running only has them pooping and peeing out out solids and liquids rather quickly without having a chance to be digested .
food for thought anyway adding roundabouts ?
the thought makes my head spin .
it'll be good for city employees though .
landscaping maintenance  stop stealing my ideas about the ‘tru’ twins of north america !
the latest on the list of similarities - trying to alter your country’s tax code without being transparent about how it affects you and your cabinet .
and i mean trudeau’ it's stereotyping .
i had a similar experience with some people in the chinese community in toronto .
"we had chinese street-people attending one of our shelter programs , and asked a chinese community organization if they could help ."
they said no because there weren't any chinese street people .
we said we had names and their personal attestation that they were chinese .
"the community organization then said that we were mistaken , that these street people were really vietnamese or korean , since chinese people in canada did not produce street people and i assume that that may be because of the stereotype you highlight ."
"if you object to jesus' commands to his followers , you are free , like the disciples mentioned in the gospel of john , to cease following the christ ."
"if you object to clerics using airlines to cross continents , you're simply being obstreperous to avoid coming to terms with the issues here ."
"perhaps you can remove the log in your own eye by selling your computer and giving the money to the poor , and then you will see clearly to remove the spec from your neighbour's eye ."
ask any of the fools and there would not be a single answer that makes any logical sense !
the king can only ever be right ?
"not for the politicians who voted for rail , they are stuffing money into their pockets from campaign contributions ."
of course the party gets what it wants .
"political parties are organizations of individual people , to which a great number of people choose to belong , despite your pompous disapproval , or they obviously wouldn't exist ."
"they're also corporations , which conservatives constantly tell us are people ."
"you don't have to join one , you don't have to vote for anyone who belongs to one ."
you can write someone's name in in your favorite color crayon .
and please give me an example of a large institution that is not corrupt .
"your assumption that low pay , low skill jobs are the only ones vulnerable to automation is mistaken ."
the goal of artificial intelligence based automation is to perform functions that require minimal manual effort but a lot of intellectual effort .
given that a computer beat the world's greatest chess player ever over 20 years ago suggests that that horizon may not be too far off .
"i'm certainly not denying the expansion of automation , it's indeed everywhere ."
but your statement the effect of demanding a living wage is lost jobs is not universally applicable .
"there are some low skill low paying jobs that will likely never be supplanted by automation , the fruit and vegetable industry being a prime example ."
"a high level of education and skill set are not going to immediately and permanently make someone immune to automation , robots are already assisting with surgery ."
so where do you go to make yourself irreplaceable ?
maybe roll on down to the apple orchard or waffle house .
"of course she meant it , if she did it to an indian or a muslim she would be charged with a hate crime so charge her with that offence ."
ramaphosa is rupert puppet he is doing what rupert says so main person is rupert who is responsible for the fall of sa .
the great recession caused a nearly 5% drop in inflation adjusted per capita gdp in less than two years .
"since then , it has grown almost 10% ."
"of course that means less than 5% real per capita gdp growth over the last decade , which includes the great recession ( see https://tradingeconomics ."
"but that is a poor argument against saving money on health care by shifting from premiums , deductibles , and co-pays to taxes ."
"i guess saving money would lead to job losses in health care billing and insurance related activities , which may not be so great in a stagnant economy , but the expectation would be more jobs in providing actual health care and more competitive industries in general , due to better health outcomes and fewer people stuck in jobs because of health care fears ."
hmmmmm does reading the adn online for free really count as a 'subscription' ?
trump just lost his mind again on bill o'reilly's show .
don't think he'll have too many supporters left in the senate and house after this .
don't forget - if they publicize his gift - it might encourage others who have wealth to contribute to this and other worthwhile causes thereby allowing us taxpayers a break and providing us with wonderful facilities .
those are his exact words and he is no actor in a reality tv show .
"since he tells it like it is , what do those words that he chose mean ?"
hrc and putin are cut from the same cloth .
"power hungry , dictatorial individuals who love to blow smoke and speak out of both sides of their mouths couldn't think of two people who would get along better than those two !"

i do wonder what specific remedies the consulting architects are considering for the fill liquefaction issue .
anybody notice the increasing presence of foreigners as professors in our universities ?
and we don't have any jobs for grad students ?
something tells me somebody high up there is profiting at the expense of the mass correct .
"what was declared was that baptisms using odd references such as “creator , redeemer and sanctifier” were not valid in the first place because they are not the formula given by christ himself and because no one but the baptizer knows what those words signify ."
characterize god as you please--and at your peril .
"you can have your post conciliar god , but i prefer the god holy church taught us to know , love , and adore for 1900 plus years ."
"none of this medieval maneuvering has diddly-squat to do with any group of people who call themselves christian , i ."
"it may , however , provide dan brown with his next stupid book and tom hanks with another bad movie ."
"it is a statistical fact , unless muslims begin to secularize and have smaller families , that some time within the next 60 to 100 years , muslims will be the majority in canada ."
that will be a disaster for the liberties and freedoms of liberal western democracy within canada .
"for sure the world in 2100 will be much , much different due to the march of technology and other issues that we see today and cannot change ."
the global population itself will be over 12 billion .
but we should use all of our energies to avoid outcomes that we do not want .
i do not want to live in a muslim nation .
"again , i do not care about the color of canadians ."
and islam is anathema to personal liberties and freedoms .
"learn how journalism works , and learn about the concept of protecting your sources ."
looks like hillary will have the nomination locked up by the time the primary hits oregon .
"you had a good run , bernie ."
rail will greatly ease congestion for the people that ride it .
and it will slightly lessen it for the drivers along the corridor ( unless djou takes away lanes for buses ) .
"the buses currently are subsidized 70-80 percent , so rail is no different ."
think of rail as a greatly expanded bus system .
"my head , being continually bemused and angered by jz's teflon-like ability to avoid any repercussion for his actions , thinks this journey stretches well beyond december 2017 ."
"with m103 , it's surprising that we are even allowed to discuss this topic ."
"no , turkey - we will let you know  if the payroll tax replaced the monthly premiums , it could work as long as the government put a cap on the $$ or % of the tax ."
"putting together your monthly premium , any deductibles , and copays or any other out of pocket costs , it might be a total lower out of pocket cost or even a wash but the wildcard it the government not capping or annually increasing it for the average taxpayer ."
it also needs to be combined with a review of the health care cost side of the ledger .
"pharmacy costs are ridiculous when they are spending less than 10% on r&d , ingredient costs are minor and yet they charge hundreds to tens of of thousands of dollars for medicines ."
or drastically increase the cost of existing medicines for no reason but to make an unreasonable profit .
and hospital costs also need to be reviewed .
"hello hugh or hugh wording re this by you: you pretending to be hispanic , which has what to do with what i wrote here and you answered with the hispanic nonsense ?"

"i should have known the wording style earlier : (  thank you , thank you ."
"i love every part of this , and am so tired of hearing that we should accommodate intolerant or oppressive ideologies above our collective canadian human rights and laws ."
"we want diversity , to quote churchill , where 'the rights of your fist end where the rights of my nose begin' ."
we do not want to be hearing that we will just excuse this and that violation in this or that circumstance because religion/culture/etc deserves our indulgence .
we do not want to suddenly hear excuses for fgm or that honour killings need special sentencing consideration or m103 'thou must not critique religion' motions .
"it’s the ultimate , the ultimate catastrophe , the biggest problem this world has , and nobody’s focusing on the nuts and bolts of it ."
people don’t believe they’re going to get sick until they do .
nobody wants to talk about it .
"i believe the greatest of all stupidities is people’s believing it will never happen , because everybody knows how destructive it will be , so nobody uses weapons ."
"” last august on television speaking with a foreign policy expert , repeatedly asked “why can’t we use nuclear weapons ."
"” trump: i think — i think , for me , nuclear is just the power , the devastation is very important to me ."
trump is a weak and insecure neurotic fraud .
"he's mentally incompetent and unfit for office he and his effeminate , white supremacist , neonazi sidekicks need to be removed from the white house ."
so you'll take the sexual predator over the enabler ?
"most of his campaign promises are impossible to fulfill anyway ( completely defeat isis , build a wall and make mexico pay for it , banning muslims from entering the country , etc ."
) so i'm not holding out hope .
"if michelle is so bad , why did cheetolini's prostitute wife copy her speech ?"
; )  and what does that have to do with the contention laid out ?
"i can only assume that you're fine with someone that makes the majority of his or hers income from a corporation and they vote on legislation that is important to their well being and not , perhaps , ours ."
"so , what is upsetting to you , the fact that these suicides take place in a visible public place , or that they happen at all ?"
making the bridge safe will only cause them to seek another option .
at least we remain aware that suicides happen in our community .
the paper doesn't publish suicides unless they happen in public and would otherwise be remarked on .
are you then going to make sure somehow no one can get drugs they can od on ?
hide all the knives to slit their wrists in the tub ?
"for the money spent on higher railings , how about we instead spend the money on the things that actually prevent suicides ."
"like treatment and maybe , just maybe , open our hearts to people like those who are transgender or have depression or kids who are bullied or abused , and others who have high suicide risk , rather than making fun of them and turning their lives into some sick joke by demeaning their struggles ."
reminds me of we had to destroy the village to save it .
"bye-bye , pfd one only hopes that those who are so dissatisfied with 'colonialist' canada will reverse their travels and head back to whatever amazing countries they or their familes hale from and which presumably do not have such difficult histories ."
or will they choke on their own hypocrisy and remain here to help crowd out canada's indigenous peoples along with everyone else whose ( colonialist ) families have arrived in the last 600 years ?
i'll lay 1000-1 odds on the latter .
"( ms saini , you seem quite a bit brighter so please stay here with the rest of us ."
")  many canadians have strong sentiments on racial diversity and mass immigration , but do not associate themselves with neo-nazis , kkk , white supremacists , or alt right groups ."
they are simply everyday canadians who do not adhere to justin trudeau's globalist ideology of canada as a post-national state .
"the canadian nationalist party is mainstream canada , and that scares the fascist left ."
"well there we have it , rr admitting that he sees himself as superior to most people ."
"hey richard , you're not the only person who has lived here a long time , you know ."
"well he obviously found love in the form of his husband aaron , who is neither fat nor fem ."
people's entitlement to their own personal preferences in the choice of a partner does not make them exclusive in the broad sense of the word .
only a fool would suggest otherwise .
"ah , well i thought i'd take a wild guess at where you worked yes to a very mild and fair state income tax , which everyone would have to contribute a minimum as outlined in the house version ."
"as to the same from everyone , that isn't practical and the vast majority of states and the federal government use a progress scale for income taxes , just as alaska should implement ."
"i wasn't addressing those part-time alaskans sometime called snowbirds , although i think they should forfeit any dividend unless outside for medical necessity ."
"i was address those non-alaskans who are working many , many jobs in alaska , yet live in another state ."
unfortunately a sales tax is not fair on several levels .
it isn't fair to tax basic necessities .
it isn't fair to tax the poorest households a greater percentage of household income .
it isn't fair to tax the higher costs of goods and service in rural alaska when those same items cost much less in anchorage and on the road belt .
"yes , he is sephardic ( or mizrahi ) ; he is jewish and from the muslim world ."
there are many jews from the maghreb in montréal ( as well as in paris and in israel ) .
a sad day in american politics when both of the current presidential nominees have the most unfavorable ratings from voters in modern history .
the two party system is dead if this is the best we can do .
trump was elected because he sided with a mainstream america that had been demonized by the left .
"clinton ran a divisive campaign based on identity politics , unlike obama , and lost a lot of the white voters who had voted for obama ."
the sad thing is that if you mention penny oleksiak a year from now - people will say who's she ?
i can now walk 20 steps to the corner store and pick from a selection of dozens of local craft beer brands .
there's never been a better time to be alive !
"thank you john , your observations are a troubling reminder of the lack of respect for life ."
"there is a lack of compassion for these beautiful animals and birds , hunting should be a deeply respectful undertaking , showing reverence towards the life you are taking ."
"i believe the agencies tasked with regulating the hunts are complacent in the poor behavior , for the board of game and commisioner the animals are numbers only ."
there is a feeling of entitlement to these resources like they are managing a farm .
the unethical methods used to slaughter predators to artificially bump up numbers of moose and caribou only perpetuates lack of respect for all these birds and animals .
"they are not just numbers and resources as these agencies manage them as but , living , breathing , spirit filled creature all struggling for survival ."
it seems most humans have long ago lost this connection .
hunting is now ego driven and more about killing and collecting than true need and subsistence with respect .
"pnw mike , now you claim that you can read minds ."
"with you having that advantage , i don't stand a chance ."
