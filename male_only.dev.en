this place is bomb diggity .
the performances were effortless and magical .
expect to spend some $ $ $ $ ... .
- lrb - the good - rrb - 0 .
"yes , absinthe should you watch this show ?"
the palace pan roast is exceptionally good .
<UNK> is <UNK> on this place .
this is my favorite japanese steakhouse around by far .
this place was dope .
hipster waffles are great .
its a must try .
their soups are phenomenal .
its a perfect place for lunch .
its the best in my opinion .
cold toppings is badass to say the least .
weakest <UNK> sauce in western pa .
its was so good im mean so so good .
ca n't ask for much more than that .
they charged 00 bucks to look at it .
what started poorly has turned quite well .
this experience ranks as just that .
this was no better .
not too bad a joint .
"cool decor , decent food at an affordable price ."
everyone of the other coaches are the same way .
had just recently replaced my others not long before .
this stadium is an absolute gem .
great gym to be at .
no complaints otherwise than the ones listed above .
pretty cool little joint overall good customer service .
it truly is 0 star .
will be back again very soon .
not too many teams offer that .
keep up the good work !
culvers is without peers in the fast food industry .
the <UNK> program is a joke .
best selection of food in the area .
so the appetizer got us excited for the mains .
i never abandon dishes .
i only got though 0/0 of that shank .
"not the end of the world , but close ."
"wasted a pot , <UNK> ."
minus one star for the grind .
this place is great for someone on a budget .
how is this place not rated higher ?
what a fantastic burger .
the star of this burger is the patty .
all in all the food was a great value .
minus one star because they charge for coffee .
"two eggs , sausage , potatoes , and fruit ."
potatoes are unique and flavourful .
the fried chicken is flawless .
my heart <UNK> at the thought of this burger .
why is it so damn good ?
i ' ll tell you why .
the hype is real .
am i at cora ?
this was good times .
the service here was great .
the butter chicken was bad .
' ' that about sums this course up .
got to rid the balloon taste from my mouth .
mains : thank god .
good protein makes up for everything .
"great pianist and <UNK> , doing their thing ."
and this place does it near perfection .
this place place makes a mean chicken parm .
the mains were the stars .
i like this place a lot .
we all had a <UNK> sandwich .
"yup , i love gimmicks ."
this place is worth checking out .
and that ' s all there is to it .
my family ' s dinner was very similar .
hits the spot each time .
it pays little attention to detail .
the food is great .
their burritos are fantastic .
this place deserves to be busier .
nothing special about them at all .
impressed with their honesty and the sense of pride from their workers .
greg field tempe az sprinkler doctors was a truly great experience for me .
"i was quoted by another company for a $ 00,000 redo of our sprinkler system ."
"i was off with my wife for new years , and i took her here for lunch yesterday ."
"i always get the margarita pizza , but my wife insisted we get a salad , too ."
"i had never had any here and my wife loves chocolate , so adam suggested the <UNK> ."
"but , like always amazing food and spot on service ."
i recently went to the joint at hard rock for a concert and was blown away .
"we talked to her but she said her manager <UNK> , or something was busy ."
"i hope santana chooses wise and makes his residency much more professional , clean and welcoming ."
this is an ` order at the counter and have it brought to your table place ' .
"both the fried and <UNK> bowls , and the tenders themselves ."
hands down has great customer service and there pizza is amazing along with many of their other dishes .
soba is big burrito ' s take on asian fusion .
"as with everything concerning big burrito , soba is excellent in all departments ."
the space is elegant - - a waterfall <UNK> the interior .
lighting is dark as is the decor - - as with most big burrito establishments .
dishes are inventive - lrb - not your normal asian fusion dishes here - rrb - and well presented .
the quality of the ingredients is top-notch - lrb - my tuna tar <UNK> tasted very fresh - rrb - .
"as a note , tasting menus are not available - - two specials seemed to offered every night ."
"the service is excellent , as is to be expected ."
"its just sliced sausage , with garlic - lrb - raw - rrb - ."
"be prepared for the fire , but this is an excellent dish ."
"the service is not perfect , but better than you should expect from most asian establishments ."
this place is new american at its best - lrb - in pittsburgh - rrb - .
it did not beat my experience with the pork porterhouse just a few nights prior though .
"the wine selection is extensive , as should be expected ."
"regardless , this is about the best dining experience in pittsburgh ."
i say this as someone who is very much a gringo .
* the men ' s room could use some attention .
the <UNK> <UNK> the urinals to the walls has begun to peel and the porcelain itself is <UNK> .
"being quick is great , but even applebee ' s is n't that quick and they just microwave things ."
"it is what it is , and the food is tasty enough ."
"i ' ll be back , ' cause i do n't have an ounce of regret ."
they served me the biggest chicken thigh and drumstick that i have ever seen .
i got a couple of steak tacos to go which i had later at work .
the sauce in the cups that were packaged with was a highlight .
"the sushi area seemed sanitary , and two guys were making the rolls fresh as i browsed ."
so i stopped in here after work with a few co-workers .
i tried two beers and sampled a bit of a third .
"<UNK> nova , <UNK> brown ale , and a bit of their pilot <UNK> autumn ale ."
i tried the <UNK> on the suggestion of one of the people i was here with .
i ' d recommend this to someone who says they do n't like beer .
the <UNK> was given to us in a pitcher by another party that was leaving .
"i had n't been to pedro ' s in years , since i lived in the area ."
"it was never one of my favorite places in madison , but i did enjoy it occasionally ."
i ' m generally underwhelmed by the americanized mexican places that dot maps of most towns .
"i had the asada burrito , and my dad had the chili burrito ."
"all in all , if you know what you ' re in for it ' s very standard <UNK> fare ."
it arrived about 00 minutes later without any major issues there .
"when i opened up the pizza , it looked promising ."
both <UNK> swill and more local stuff like new <UNK> or wisconsin brewing co . .
the dã © cor is just as tacky as i remember .
it didnt get soggy until the very end when it was mostly just kraut and dressing left .
they use crushed ice and a shot of <UNK> to mix it .
"- my fiancã © e got the mushroom and swiss burger , and her patty was burned ."
my only real complaint about <UNK> is that it ' s not an international airport .
to say it ' s among the best in madison would be an understatement .
i can say that after one trip if they ' re at all consistent .
"although i ' m in madison a lot , i only recently got a chance to check it out ."
a five star greenhouse with a couple of issues that turn it into a three star greenhouse .
the prices are on the higher end of reasonable for most things .
indian restaurants seem to either be very formal or extremely casual .
"that was definitely my first impression , so be prepared ."
i figured something more basic would give me a gauge to work from if and when i return .
i ' ve been coming here since before they changed locations .
"it ' s been consistent , it ' s been good ."
"here , though , their normal slices are painfully underrated in favor of their mac and cheese pizza ."
"the mac and cheese pizza is overrated , guys , it ' s tired ."
the sausage with cheese is where it ' s at .
"do n't get me wrong , their more eclectic offerings are always tasty ."
"- rrb - , the brisket and tots pizza is another fantastic option ."
take your kid to work day used to be interesting .
"i will admit , this place has been a bit of a <UNK> at times ."
"on that note , i ' ll also admit that i ' ve only ever tried their gyro ."
the texture and flavor of <UNK> ' s meat succeeds where other gyro places fail .
"the dã © cor is n't anything fancy , but since the remodel it seems pretty nice ."
"- lrb - this place used to look like a dump , not so much anymore ."
- rrb - the roof garden upstairs provides a nice enough view of state street and the state capitol .
if you ' re not a fan of that scene i would avoid the <UNK> at night .
"if you are , the gyros are even better when you ' re drunk ."
"oh , what the hell , this is madison ' s retro gaming mecca ."
there ' s classic advertisements for old systems and just tons of cool stuff everywhere .
the same guy who runs the store is in there every time i ' ve been in .
"this place is actually a pretty good diner , which is surprising considering its a truck stop ."
"i ' ve had messed up orders at the one in johnson creek , but never here ."
"the prices are extremely low compared to a lot of places around madison , as well ."
"a five star state capitol , snake infestation or not ."
once you ' re in there is just a ton of stuff to see and do .
"surprisingly , the place almost never seems dirty , even near the end of a game ."
"best sauce , best ribs , best this , best that ."
you do n't get the awards this place has without knowing what you ' re doing .
i ' m also big fan of the bbq baked beans .
"service is also always friendly and quick , especially considering how big the restaurant is ."
i ' ve been coming to glass nickel for years on and off .
they also have a cash discount which is pretty cool .
it is obvious that the staff is not trained and not well managed .
the sausage is the sliced type rather than the meatball type and it was really good .
large was actually large and pretty cheap at $ 00 for a 00 ' ' !
really good quality food on par with the best indian restaurants in this region .
simple menus and the convenience of a world food market while you wait !
it was a little difficult to find but worth looking far .
i ' ve stayed with them as service is a few ticks more important than price .
i paid $ 0000 installed for a roof top unit .
i have to carry on sentiments from others over the years .
there is more to the story but i ' ll keep in brief .
walked in to a very warm greeting even though it was ten minutes to closing .
my wife and i got down to rita ' s to see what the <UNK> was about .
"my wife had watermelon which btw was hand made with real pieces of watermelon , nice ."
how does one make ` ` ice ' ' smooth ?
just a fair warning to anyone buying a certified <UNK> bmw .
they ' d do anything to sell ya a car .
