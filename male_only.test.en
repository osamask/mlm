ok but not special .
my wife ordered the tenderloin sliders .
not the best i ever had but good .
"while not traditional , both are tasty ."
all excellent and perfectly cooked .
they are the most flavorful of the animal .
"and the bonus , no corkage ."
the food was extremely edible .
the chicken and broccoli is also very good .
i ordered yellowtail and they gave me red snapper .
that alone is a priceless gift .
the vermicelli noodles are good too .
the bad egg is a joke .
nephew got the ribs .
pretty much the opposite of fall off the bone .
the pasta pomodoro and chicken marsala were excellent .
highly recommended to everyone !
"six cars deep waiting for valet , no thanks ."
now on to trying to get a seat .
"well , yeah , and more beer ."
the taps were a disappointment .
a timer was set for 00 minutes .
the server did finally show up .
having deliveries does n't count .
the locker room is clean .
$ 0.00 pints of rogue ?
it ' s not the typical bar scene sounds .
"yes , i said it ."
i could swim in their gin and tonics .
"but hey , that ' s me ."
your first experience is the retail area .
like a ymca for the hip and spendy .
"be careful though , they pack a helluva punch ."
somewhere the art of that job got lost .
family propane has earned my business .
the food you ask ?
sign up only for this nissan dealer .
pamela ' s is <UNK> diner food .
this hotel seems to be very poorly run .
internet <UNK> was also an issue .
very courteous and attentive staff .
tried contacting and even went back the following tuesday .
still do n't have my jacket or bag .
best experience each time i dine .
the food was ok at best .
i ca n't recommend this place .
he ' s definitely an asset to the restaurant .
"they will exceed your expectations , guaranteed ."
they take care of their members and employees .
"this is real , not a scam ."
visit this site and please pass it along .
all could benefit from lessons in <UNK> .
the steak tasted good and was delivered as ordered .
decent price for some good burgers and milkshake .
this will be a great spot for spring training .
ask for reno behind the bar .
a really cool and upscale place .
go in and check this place out .
and again they killed it .
its a popeyes at the lv airport .
"still , it was a nice $ 0 snack ."
excellent food with great service .
the menu looked interesting and inviting .
the cakes were fairly large and of good thickness .
"the veggies were finely diced , as i prefer ."
the main reason was eating here was convenience .
chicken chow mien was too soupy and just okay .
the lack service killed this place for me .
another triple d joint .
triple d dives are notoriously busy after being aired .
way more than could fit between the bread halves .
the gumbo looked and smelled delicious .
the location is hard to beat .
they pour a damn good drink also .
another cool little burger joint has been found .
and five guys make a good little burger .
the place is very clean and simple .
the menu is about as simple as it gets .
it ' s big juicy burger patties .
two words - the best !
. bonus coffee out front for people waiting .
carrots and peppers with them perfect combo .
this place is weak !
may have to go back tomorrow .
will try more breads in the future .
great place to escape the heat too .
we had a blast here goofing around taking pictures .
what a cool place .
"i went with my girlfriend , and another couple ."
everyone there was extremely knowledgeable and nice .
wing <UNK> is very costly .
wine bottles start in the $ 00 range .
the curries are great .
this place kind of sucks now .
not surprising the food got left behind .
it was a <UNK> and they made things right .
food was delicious and will eat here again .
especially if you are going to get a fade .
food was fast and cheap and good .
want cheap and fast and good ?
you will not be disappointed .
the food is incredible .
and the ambiance is good enough .
tiny and fantastic and worth a visit .
the food and service were top notch .
my go-to place for quality mexican food .
"simple , good , and reliable ."
is it unbelievable or absurdly cheap ?
"no , by its darn good ."
carne asada is the best .
the tastiest fast food chicken around .
above average and consistent .
it ' s an indulgence .
- ambiance / design / feel is incredible .
do i have any reason to return ?
probably the best restaurant in tempe .
this <UNK> makes others look bad .
it ' s the way it should be .
store is big and well stocked .
employees are nice enough .
just another <UNK> inn express .
all was good for about the next 00 minutes .
- rrb - here is where it gets strange .
other riders were confused as well .
and the homemade salsa has some heat .
i do n't know where to start .
great and roomy place .
then you can exit as you please .
all the dishes are fresh and quality .
"also , they get an extra star on presentation !"
remember that you have the <UNK> bouncers at tryst .
the adult pool at encore is fun .
the creme brulee was done perfectly and very good .
service was good and quick .
i ' m certain the coffee is normally better .
service was spot on and very attentive .
my wife absolutely loved the cucumber margarita .
the menu looked solid and interesting .
my wife chose the curry chicken salad over greens .
too bad i ca n't give it 0.0 stars .
this place is a good cross over hit .
<UNK> was good but not worth the money .
"quiet , clean and affordable hotel ."
"it is , quite directly , a tavern ."
- rrb - fantastic tin ceiling .
the quality is much better than the normal chains .
the chips and salsa were great .
prime rib is really good .
but nice room with no fridge or microwave .
the attention to detail is unmatched .
very professional and fast .
takeout was a miserable experience here .
awesome place and a lot of fun !
great ambiance and friendly staff .
much friendlier and cleaner plane .
"otherwise , an airline is an airline ."
tasty but not the most tender steak ever eaten .
"plus , the coffee looks top notch !"
what a gargantuan burger .
i ate it in 0 minutes .
what about the burger ?
make sure to get a lot of napkins .
but first ... avoid the regular burger .
the graze burger is amazing .
beer selection here is excellent too !
"keep up the great work , cory !"
"five stars , cory !"
could n't be more pleased with the end result .
great food nice service .
the guy did ask me though .
the ants came back about three weeks later .
ca n't say enough good things about this place .
"not the cashiers , nor cook ' s fault ."
this is the place for it .
yesterday was my worst experience there ever .
quick and easy to prepare .
very poor service to say the least .
beverage orders were taken and delivered promptly .
my wife ordered country fried steak and eggs .
good food does cost money to make .
eating here for a third time now .
great food and service .
lunch menu available till 0pm daily .
"great simple , clean venue without an overloaded menu ."
had a 00 ' ' pizza that was phenomenal .
great job to everyone at this pizza establishment .
everyone in my group left satisfied .
"when upgrade , do it right ."
i was in need of auto insurance .
do n't valet at the rio !
angel pretty much just makes stuff disappear and <UNK> .
"had a few rolls , miso soup and sake ."
the included item selection was excellent .
said it was corporate policy on weekends .
this will be our last time at naked fish .
worst run store i ' ve been in .
today i have done nothing but puke .
"the buffet was solid , mediterranean station in particular ."
come here every time that i am in vegas .
the jacuzzi is excellent here and very beautiful .
legit indian food with a nice patio .
what else do you want me to say ?
this is an awesome place .
my wife and i went there for lunch .
both sandwiches were excellent .
"avoid it , it ' s a rip-off ."
here on business and <UNK> was simply awesome .
the nirvana chocolate dessert took us to another planet !
great place to grab a slice and wings .
great service and food is great .
i had the coldest blue moon ever .
the pools are also amazing .
the vegan nachos are a great example .
i do n't care how tired you are .
"after eating the burger i felt cheated , <UNK> ."
the bartenders are outstanding .
our service was attentive and prompt .
"if you want tacos , go to <UNK> ."
"simple , tasty , filling ."
i am not really a sushi guy either .
king richard was pleased .
they were very kind to my palate .
"cruel world , i know ."
- rrb - and make it relatively on time .
i stumbled in here as a research project .
i left with a bag full of great finds .
"jesus , toast them or something ."
the order was delivered in a <UNK> prompt fashion .
"lets get to the wings , shall we ?"
"in all honesty , i threw about 0 away ."
i never throw food away .
why four stars you ask ?
my gripe is the price points for the quality .
this brings me to my issue .
bacon wrapped dates are 00 dollars .
try an 0 dollar price point .
this place is another pgh <UNK> .
caffe <UNK> is its own niche .
"they have a quaint inside , and sidewalk seating ."
the outside porch is magnificent .
the pb should be a very delicate spread though .
the taco stand ... does not dissapoint .
another new place in <UNK> ?
less calories more taste ?
"once again , i can make this at home ."
<UNK> is what it is .
i had a chorizo sort of frittata thing .
the service was quite good .
the chicken is perfectly spiced and extremely tender .
"i will return for a simple , awesome meal ."
"it was decent , somewhat reminiscent of a manhattan ."
the gin special was nice .
good times had by all .
"for drinks , they get an a + ."
"my girlfriend , the same ."
that was not the case here at <UNK> .
headed here for my birthday amid the hype .
"yup , still awesome ."
both were succulent and juicy .
the pork was also cooked just right .
"thus , its awesome !"
a bombay and tonic set me back 0 dollars .
"hell , you can even smoke cigars here ."
manny gets it right .
"more like miami vice , or maybe boogie nights ."
<UNK> attempts to be a quaint mediterranean bistro .
these were without a doubt my favorite .
"simple , but they nailed it ."
both dishes were hearty and full of flavor .
i have waited so long to try cure .
"its not country kitchen buffet , folks ."
i probably wouldnt give it a second shot .
the rest of the interior doesnt really match it .
some places have been successful at this .
"that in itself , is a negative ."
the other ingredients were sparse and lacked the definition .
"sorry , but we yelpers notice this stuff ."
my girlfriend and i opted to split and sample .
this is how a burger should be .
the food was simply outstanding .
all were impeccable and the prices were fairly reasonable .
i would most highly recommend and will return soon .
this leads to my next issue .
perhaps they had a bad day .
the bread was <UNK> but the butter rock hard .
the steakhouse mac n ' cheese was unbelievably good .
their winter brew is simply awful .
the tap room is done up nicely .
rolled on this small funky joint yesterday afternoon .
not a lot of meat on these dudes .
found this bird average to slightly below par .
food was very good .
too many odd german beers on tap however .
horrific experience with the owner andrea .
is this place now out of business ?
great waiter who was informative and observant .
"the food was good , better than expected ."
would definitely return in the future .
great experience all around .
and the prices / value are incredible .
the owner / manager was such a nice guy .
interior was excellent along with very attentive staff .
ingredients seemed very fresh and tasty .
the fajitas where very good indeed after the wait .
the technician was very friendly and professional .
the crew that trimmed our trees was very professional .
i will gladly use <UNK> again .
the customer service is incredibly bad .
the wings are only ok .
unfortunately no other wings delivery .
walked in it was clean yet old fashioned looking .
was wondering what i got myself into .
i like the way they do it here .
now on to the staff .
"my nurse , diane , is fantastic ."
"my <UNK> is <UNK> , tech is joe ."
very nice and clean rooms .
worth the slight detour off the freeway .
and the staff was very friendly .
"good optometrist , good staff in the past ."
this place puts wing stop to shame .
absolutely worth the short drive south of the strip .
these are the best hot dogs ever .
i have n't found a place better yet .
great location and very personal feel .
"best prices and service in town , hands down ."
the grilled chicken gyro was juicy and very flavorful .
great food all around .
"delicious sandwiches , fresh ingredients and fresh cooked bread ."
great for casual style dining .
she made the experience top notch .
i will never eat at this place ever again .
i could n't be more pleased with the work .
the food was fantastic .
the service was outstanding .
the service is also very good as well .
they are friendly and do great work .
best pizza and wings on town .
the wings are not your tiny ordinary wings .
this place is very not professional .
the place is just too large .
"overall , i highly recommend this show ."
the real treat was the main courses .
each scallop was probably 0-0 inches in diameter .
full of marble - lrb - faux ?
boom goes the dynamite !
stopped in after work .
another great restaurant experience .
fair portions and prices as well .
very small and dirty looking and nearly no parking .
"she replied no , nobody said that ."
extremely fair prices and large portions .
must say i was amazed with this place .
want some good poutine ?
may i suggest the rose and crown pub .
"give it a try , you wo n't regret ."
this place was a <UNK> all around .
this is a great hotel .
the underwater speakers in the pool are pretty awesome .
what a great bar !
had traditional and red curry .
are you a tourist in montreal ?
it taste better then it sounds .
this show was pretty good for the money .
he was funny and had some awesome talents .
the best burger in town .
the best burger in in town .
never had a bad hamburger form here .
you must get the ox tail chili cheese fries .
you should go and try it out .
i am a continuously returning customer .
wide variety of teams and goods .
___ update : its the bomb !
its enjoyable every time i ' ve been there .
consistently fresh and delicious .
sun chinese does have chinese food .
all were very good .
went there based on the reviews .
ordered the pancit - lrb - sp ?
the portions were generous .
i ca n't recommend this place at all .
the positives - the appetizers were impressive .
the date and bacon tart was equally satisfying .
food is pretty good .
prices are reasonable for indian food .
i ' m not a fan of indian food .
when i got back to my hotel room .
yeah ... that ' s better .
"ok , let ' s continue ."
best burger in arizona .
wash that down with some orange crush .
additionally the wait staff was very friendly .
they also make excellent breakfast and lunch food .
really you ca n't go wrong here .
i guess i was mistaken .
"i know , wtf ?"
it was that atrocious .
do i have to spell it out ?
it seems there is a consensus on this place .
dino ' s is not that kind of place .
at least it was n't when i visited .
it is too doughy and chewy .
thanks for the help yelp !
the girl at the front was pleasant .
save yourself and just hit that place up instead .
"most diners have reasonable coffee , not this place ."
the waiter we had was awesome and very friendly .
my experience here was terrible .
the catfish is terrible .
lee ' s has a decent selection .
the sandwiches they make are also quite filling .
sorry if my previous review led anyone astray .
they are seasoned amazingly well .
fast forward over a year .
all in all i had a good time .
now on to the food .
the wait staff was also excellent .
great bar but very poor food quality .
0 stars for the ufc specials .
did he pick this out of a hat ?
it was piss poor .
and the marinara was bland and tasteless .
stay tuned you fat ol ' <UNK> .
the bartenders have an attitude to boot .
towels are available for all guests .
the hot pretzels are tasty .
in late 0000 they destroyed it .
the hostesses were also dull <UNK> .
the fremont area downtown location has much friendlier staff .
- rrb - to round it out .
to say it was great is an understatement .
recommend the brisket and the ribs .
park on fremont was great .
"five stars : great food , service , prices ."
- food is expensive .
never pay full price for tickets to vegas shows .
the pork was tender and flavorful .
the result is one great bowl of ramen .
talk about immediate addiction .
metro pizza never ever disappoints .
i ' ve enjoyed metro for 00 years .
on this trip i ordered the <UNK> pizza .
one bite and your hooked .
metro is a local favorite and never disappoints .
nice selection of entrees averaging around $ 0 .
i got the shoyu poke and teriyaki beef plate .
the beef and the rice were fine .
came here with my wife on a rainy afternoon .
"the <UNK> was good , but nothing special ."
the meatball sub was pretty good .
the sandwich was tiny ! ! ! .
overall i ' d give this deli 0.0 stars .
much better options in vegas .
second : pick you ' re meat .
"excellent food , customer service , and ambience ."
they have several locations around town .
unbelievable how busy that street is .
my wife absolutely loves the poke here .
the hawaiian specialties are all good .
regular be prepared not to eat again till dinner .
this restaurant fits the bill .
just a shout out to the catfish .
<UNK> everywhere would be proud .
awesome all the way around .
"they were seasoned perfectly , and piping hot ."
country chicken fried steak and gravy .
nigiri sushi was excellent .
excellent quality and nice selection .
overall nice small restaurant .
good food but horrible staff .
i had an experience very similar to collins .
this is what pizza should be .
great staff and the highest level of service .
the worst in the business hands down !
everything with <UNK> american homes has been a challenge .
it ' s the worst in the business .
everyone here has been terrific .
very professional and kind .
devin <UNK> is beyond fantastic !
devin was just spot on from the beginning .
i ca n't say enough about devin <UNK> .
the shrimp were actually too big and just uninspired .
skip desserts unless you like hot spicy desserts .
the food was decent but nothing special .
i wo n't go to anyone else .
the first 0 visits were ok .
there are plenty of options for an oil change .
great service and pricing !
chuck and his crew are the bomb !
@user # % ing sandwich .
the vibe inside is very close knit .
razzy fresh frozen yogurt is like crack .
the server we had was great .
"the food was excellent , by the way ."
it was still prepared expertly .
perk me up is a lawrenceville staple .
"anyway , with that out of the way ."
the omelets were full and incredibly hardy .
"but come on , the owners speak french !"
i have a more <UNK> article on my website .
what are you trying to do here ?
they do cheesesteaks really well here .
order and then have your food brought to you .
as an appetizer i had the fried ripe plantains .
all in all the food here was incredible .
it was interesting to say the least .
the ingredients were top notch .
the laundry factory does not have this .
the plating and presentation was superb .
slightly cramped and personal but not too personal .
each piece is a perfect cut and perfectly constructed .
"http://url <UNK> pool tables , check ."
"the food was excellent , however ."
there ' s nothing really wrong with it .
the food is sooooo bland though .
i think it went well with the tacos .
<UNK> <UNK> is one of them .
their heat scale is hit or miss .
the pork belly was excellent .
i think tamari fits that bill perfectly .
"everyone working there is great , too ."
on my first trip i had moussaka .
definitely give this place a try .
"oh yeah , and the bar ?"
my girlfriend really liked her crepe as well .
we started off with the yucatan bean dip appetizer .
i ' ll be back .
the empanadas were awesome .
tessaro ' s is so old school it hurts .
"yes , their burger is incredible ."
not quite authentic but good enough for pittsburgh .
the beer was great as all belgium beers are .
the fries were incredible .
"it was , quite surprisingly , incredibly good ."
very interesting decor and characters that run the place .
this place is incredible .
i ' m a beer guy .
the casino is casino themed .
hit the buffet or sit down for table service ?
"at first glance , the menu says diner ."
the reality not so much .
$ 0 one way - c'mon man !
$ 00 day pass - a little more palatable .
sage was our choice on this latest trip .
i normally will not eat at a chain .
excellent wine selection accompanied by great tapas .
this place is a true hidden gem .
this particular location blows especially hard .
that ' s the impression i got from <UNK> .
"quite frankly , the worst bank experience ever ."
i was there for a bachelor party .
is the hotel ` ` nice ' ' ?
are the rooms nice ?
"to quote jack <UNK> , ` ` absolutely not !"
you truly ca n't beat naked fish ' s !
this was in middle of afternoon .
this review is for the chinese menu only .
have a very diverse menu .
oysters were awesome as were the king crab legs .
can tell they change their kegs .
cast and band all good several comic moments .
band rocked out especially during encore .
wow what a find this place was .
is amazing value for the price .
sadly no place like this back home .
i highly recommend it if anyone comes here .
what else is there ?
just not worth the money .
"it was good , not great ."
they also lose a star for the pretentiousness .
. just a clean room .
only come here for foie gras ... everything else .
a great appetizer or complement to the sushi .
worst marriott experience in twenty years of traveling .
"not the best , but not the worst ."
nice way of doing business .
"best mexican food in town , bar none ."
there is not a bad item on the menu .
the bone-in filet and ny strip were absolutely perfect .
"fantastic seasoning , crust and center ."
very fine italian steakhouse .
you wo n't be disappointed .
lobster mac & cheese .
the chips are fantastic .
the service was bad .
excellent service ... good job mike .
they hired a <UNK> company to repair the items .
cave and <UNK> is an excellent restaurant .
"great food , great drinks , and great atmosphere ."
casual dinner environment with a fantastic patio .
he ensured we had a fantastic evening .
the have numerous variations of typical drinks that work .
order the tostadas de <UNK> .
this <UNK> ' s location is amazing .
you ' re in lucky .
i want to rate this place ` ` meh .
i paired it with an incredible cabernet sauvignon .
prices are what you ' d expect .
i hope you recieve this .
which brings me to the taste of the sandwiches .
supercuts was the best i have had in years .
my wife and i went for lunch .
"again , no garnish , no bread ."
i sent it back for some heat .
managers doesnt take care about it .
"even in your bed , bathroom and kitchen ."
i can say for america its really good .
i will be going back .
0 of 0 pools closed .
the food itself was very mixed .
the food is tasty and the appetizers are creative .
authentic chinese food in las vegas ?
still above average for a chinese restaurant though !
and for $ 00 it better damn well be .
the best buffet ever .
great place and atmosphere .
very authentic italian food .
story is always the same here .
". kicks ass , good service and great sushi !"
dr <UNK> does great work and a good man .
the meat in the burgers is likely frozen patties .
"the french fries were passable , actually good ."
"great service , great food , great atmosphere ."
try the empanadas as an app .
kudos to her for a great job .
horrible service and the food is hit and miss .
i hope this is n't the case here .
absolutely the worst dj i ' ve ever heard .
this place is sorta hit and miss .
desert was the last and so damn good !
many options from cheese cake to oreo covered marshmallows .
very friendly and knowledgable staff .
give it a shot !
you should let the ingredients speak for itself .
but in terms of price and location ?
this place cant be beat .
thai food this time .
and the servers handled all of us extremely well .
the food was absolutely incredible .
recommended a hundred times .
will be going back .
on to the red curry duck preparation .
around 0 stars is all it deserves .
positives - efficient service .
the service was much better .
probably my favourite stop in vegas .
"this place is indeed , a-ok ."
i went with the bacon weave meatloaf .
this is the most west - lrb - south ?
ended up throwing out most of the container .
best thing i had was the bottle of water .
then the food came out .
i havent seen one of those things in <UNK> .
whats not to love about this place ?
order food came out in about 00 mins .
but i stuck to my guns 00mins .
will return when back in the area .
went in here before the movies .
do n't bother with this place .
waited about 00 - 00 minutes .
wtf ? ? ? avoid at all costs .
the cheese platter is fantastic .
the brunch buffet here is fantastic .
several different omelets and more .
do * not * trust these guys !
i will say the desert was great .
poor service and small overpriced food .
they have a very limited menu of <UNK> food .
i would recommended <UNK> !
food is overpriced and the descriptions are somewhat off .
"the food was great , as was the service ."
great outdoor sitting area and perfect location .
small and quaint with excellent decor !
the food is awesome .
"atmosphere is nothing special , but decent ."
i have been taking my bmw here for years .
"it is your basic , no frills repair shop ."
i think they are fair and honest .
i go here for lunch every so often .
its never packed to the max .
but here ... i have my set list .
wow ... and what a relief .
easy to hear yourself talk and outstanding drinks .
a place for great drinks and conversation .
first timer to dish .
it was full of flavor .
i have never had a bad time here .
this is not a college bar .
the staff was attentive and answered all our questions .
"you can do better than <UNK> , marriott ."
the whole meal was excellent .
walked in and was greeted warmly .
it was a complete waste .
took 00 min at least to cook .
just a bad timing <UNK> they forgot the bread .
i had to cut these puppies in half .
"but like i said , they still tasted good ."
"plus , they are still new ."
their food has always been great here .
its off the beaten path .
although i did get some gristle in it .
this is a ` <UNK> ' kind of meal .
no seats since its street food .
this is great pizza .
way better than mineo ' s down the street .
they do 0/0 pours instead of flights .
the wings were also pretty good .
the place is the start to something wonderful .
had the braised short ribs and polenta .
my spouse had the <UNK> burger .
it was worth the wait for this place .
these ended up being the table surprise .
now onto the rest of the experience .
it was a great meal from start to finish .
this dish is insane .
both were good neapolitan style pizzas .
but it would just be too much by itself .
i was surprised by the ` ` seating times .
they liked their cooked fish too .
checked out the coal fired oven ... pretty cool .
good thin crust pizza .
would go back in a <UNK> .
had a byo wine night here last night .
great meals for a reasonable price .
this is now my go-to indian restaurant .
no standing policy is strict .
splitting the meat loaf was like 0 bites each .
all around wonderful meal .
it ' s a truffle risotto for $ 00 .
the least expensive red was $ 00 .
the size of the appetizers was amazing .
not your 0 bites kind of app .
i got the <UNK> <UNK> .
so things stay moist and are perfectly medium rare .
"frozen with liquid nitrogen very slowly , then broken ."
my <UNK> burger was awesome .
cooked medium as requested .
good beers on tap .
got to talk with the staff and owner .
i guess i am old school .
i expect exorbitant quality to come with exorbitant prices .
"to be fair , l'atelier looks great ."
"very good staff , as well ."
wifey and i came here for a special occasion .
"btw , i had that car for ten years ."
as long as i get what i paid for .
"you need the good kid stuff , right parents ?"
"btw , the deuce is not a bad choice ."
that ' s 00 years folks .
it ' s a tradition .
that ' s what the peppermill really is .
never have had a bad meal or service here .
looking for a top tier vegas buffet ?
studio b is the best option for you .
earl of sandwich is a south vegas strip gem .
their sandwiches are so damn good .
get full and enjoy it for under ten dollars ?
way better than <UNK> at panda or <UNK> .
"i promise , you ' ll enjoy it ."
damn everything about the $ 00 resort fee .
that was not a correct assumption .
i expected a 00 + min stand in line .
my only criticism has to be the price .
but the excalibur is by no means bad .
the casino is okay .
the price tho makes it well worth my recommendation .
this is a buffet .
also the menu had some serious <UNK> issues .
a very pleasant and welcome shock .
looking for the best south of the strip ?
wish we dropped more money on somewhere else .
the games are modern .
i was not at all disappointed .
i consider myself a chicken strips guy .
the breading is very light but crispy nonetheless .
they really make the vibe that they want work .
staying at the cosmo was such a memorable experience .
the pizza margherita and espresso was surprisingly good .
this place is awesome .
this time i tried the carne asada fries .
tacos are awesome too .
same as all the other cheap mexican places .

real bait and switch .
great little local place .
fresh cheese on giant slices .
better than new york pizzeria in houston .
. also the place decorated in a unique way .
amazing pizza worth every penny .
you have to try it .
good pizza the smoked mozzarella is the best
worth trying for a relaxing and sensational dinner .
"turkey chili thick and not soupy , very flavorful ."
atlanta boy food was good not great .
local hispanic population mainly so i know authentic .
breakfast before going to convention center .

the staff is all dressed in classic formal uniforms .
prime rib is a roast and it is <UNK> .
the rooms are nice enough .
"in the end , it took 00 ."
nothing is within close walking distance .
the hilton is not connected to the monorail .
the workout room looks state of the art .
this may be an issue for some people .
self parking is limited and often full .
this woke all of us up .
these handles <UNK> locking the bathroom doors .
"there were browns , reds , blues and greens ."
nothing really matched though everything looked new .
"for an adult , it may be a problem ."
timeshare : the timeshare is not a good value .
the peppermill is a very odd place .
service : everything was right on the money here .
i got the pleasure of talking to alex <UNK> .
this wine bar has the ideal setup .
bryan is a master at knowing his wines .
i highly recommend <UNK> .
great outdoor seating and views of black mountain .
the food is top notch .
i had the prime rib .
the salsa was uninspired and bland .
the candles at the table were sorely inadequate .
the food was incredible .
great value and excellent service .
here is what was wrong ; 0 .
interesting ones have included hibiscus beer and pepper beer .
they helped me every bit of the way .
although the food is good .
then the true rula bula experience begins !
this buffet is worthy of <UNK> himself !
caffe boa classes up mill avenue .
and the pickled peppers are a sweet surprise .
mario was a great server .
great front host staff as well .
portions were ample without being too much .
$ 00 cover for vegas is not too bad .
management is on a decline .
soap and shampoo in the hotel is a joke .

flavored egg is worth the extra cost .
free wifi ! ! ! starting my gambling career .
needed a late night snack .

great service and good location on the strip .
i will bring my dad here to try .
he just kept going and going and going .
food is very good .
i really blame myself for this dining <UNK> .
this is the best food in chandler .
however those are the clerks at the front .
however there is a slight problem with this voucher .
i will admit the cases are very very easy .
it ' s pretty simple .
planet fitness took all of that away .
"great tasting food , friendly personalized service ."
took the wife there as a treat for me .
this is the yelp review .
"usually lunch , occasionally dinner ."
- lrb - + 0 star - rrb - .
really overpriced and the food is marginal .
"nice , but get it right ."
what can i say about my experience at <UNK> ?
it is not part of <UNK> proper .
the meat was prepared perfectly !
service was slow like they were short staffed .
we dropped in monday mid-morning .
their anaheim branch is as good as this branch .
to breed to develop a special type of animal .
the hot spot in vegas on friday nights .
chips and salsa are good .
overall this place was just dirty .
food is great = 0 stars .
you ' ll have to <UNK> .
a little bit expensive .
i will be back for sure .
the food is very tasteful .
this place is worth the money spent .
they do however have good on the rocks margaritas .
made it seem like a family place .
we will definitely be visiting this awesome eatery again .
those are just two little examples .
"local , inexpensive , and absolutely amazing ."
their garlic knots are absolutely out of control .
very meaty and the sauces are great .
do n't take my word for it .
i refused a car because was so dirty .
the price is ok considering the quality .
all you can eat good .
"sushi good especially frying jason , lasagna and california ."
first time tasteless indian .
william at gate 00 is an all star .
i ordered a steak burrito which was horrible .
this is your ` classic american diner ' .
"meatloaf , liver and onions etc . ."
. a special every night for just $ 0.00 .
if feels like a small hometown diner .
great eggs benedict selection on weekends and mornings .
that is why i purchased from him .
i mentioned this to the finance manager .
i contacted vantage west to verify the account status .
never missed a payment on anything !
chapman chooses not to do anything .
i disconnected it from most of the plumbing .
i brought the whole thing to laura and mike .
i called larry in the fleet department .
he confirmed the car was still there .
i drove it and wanted the car .
i decided not to buy it .
how cool is that .
just depends on your personality .
thursdays are jack daniels $ 0 bucks .
tuesday is open mike night .
the tacos on wednesday night are great !
$ 0 for 0 .
the wings are awesome here .
i do like this place .
taco tuesday is a great value here !
i have been going there exclusively since .
john is extremely smart in his trade .
. any taco for $ 0.00 .
they also have a great fish taco .
grab a modelo with these on tuesday .
nathan has an easy ear to bend .
i ca n't give this bar high marks .
that ' s ok with me .
it sucks for the patron .
smoked pork is awesome !
"amazing place , we ' ll be back ."
best gyros eva bro !
my favorites include the <UNK> and the texas .
there are few things worse than <UNK> california .
the pa system is too quiet and hardly understandable .
highly recommend the sampler for two or four .
ca n't go wrong there .
i got the <UNK> with ghost pepper jack cheese .
"best bbq in the area , hands down ."
been going for years .
everything on the menu has been great .
great food and as is the service .
pizza is really good better then little ceasers .
excellent food and service .
". it was good , nothing special ."
the thing is it was like $ 00-00 bucks .
flat screen in master room and living room .
but adding <UNK> signature fried chicken is a must .
staff is very friendly and helpful as expected .
the entire casino floor smelled like rotten cheese .
"i mean , hot dang ."
"the steaks come out , with no sides ."
they eventually showed up .
so let ' s talk about the food .
what is it with west island breakfast restaurants ?
avoiding this store is the best solution .
from the outside <UNK> looks a bit run down .
not so once you enter .
do n't miss the grilled meat .
uninspired and wildly overpriced .
i ordered the bbq ribs .
give me ribs with some texture and taste .
sadly these had neither .
little to no seasoning left them bland .
this is n't one of them .
great price great variety .
the rooms were beautiful and well appointed .
"andre , i hope you never leave le germain ."
"the service , food and staff are all outstanding ."
the sides were good though like the onion rings .
"well , thats what this feels like ."
the lobby is like walking into a renaissance cathedral .
never a bad meal .
this is what i expected vegas to be .
this new yorker thinks not .
by the way great great service .
seated promptly at a nice booth .
the service was exceptional as well .
the best thing about this experience was the service .
just leased a car from auto nation honda .
these guys are really nice .
the dealership said i was due brakes soon .
"these guys are like , not yet ."
<UNK> is a <UNK> .
service is on par .
this place is great .
never had a bad meal .
it was simply ` ` heaven .
i have not had a better meal since .
definitely going again in the near future .
decent food for a airport restaurant .
"excellent and tasty drinks , nice and new store ."
very disappointed with this visit .
the homemade chocolate cake is a must get here .
"so ... screw these guys , right ?"
another great place for ny style pizza .
' ' at each other across the table .
i ' m still a fan .
check pricing before you drop off your stuff here .
"service here is generally good , with everyone friendly ."
"also , i saw johnny chan eating here once ."
service is friendly and prompt enough .
"pepperoni and mushrooms with extra cheese , please ."
very impressed with the knowledge of the staff .
i went here for nye weekend .
despite its size he nearly finished it .
i stayed here on august 00 to 00 .
i ordered the ribeye aged 00 - days .
maybe i ' ll go here one more time .
the food is top-notch .
its not that type of cirque show .
until the opening comedic act .
there is potential for a great museum .
* not too far from uptown charlotte .
the desert was ok - rrb - .
* staff could be a lot friendlier .
what else to say ?
in short : this museum is absolutely wonderful .
but i do indeed have two concerns with clt .
fantastic authentic sonoran tacos .
i recommend the carne asada and el pastor tacos .
"decent it was , amazing it was not ."
i really dig this place .
this is an ideal bar .
"we all ordered some appetizers , beers and shots ."
everything was spot on .
a nice outside setting with some great ambience .
the food is amazing as all <UNK> are .
amazing thai for the price .
i give it 0 stars for consistency and quality .
same great taste with a sweet location .
right next to my place in the <UNK> district .
the arrogant butcher treated me right .
ca n't even get an easy car wash right .
its on the menu : .
its on the menu : .
carne asada burrito 0 .
neither was spectacular but it was good enough .
if that makes sense .
great white chicken teriyaki bowl with veggies .
i would certainly recommend this place to anyone .
you know what you are going to get .
her meal beat mine hands down .
<UNK> is the polar opposite of this concept .
kudos to fired pie !
i ' ve eaten here 0 times now .
i am a carne asada enthusiast !
the menu was <UNK> down to fantastic choices .
i would recommend this place to anyone .
let me emphasize the large coffee cups they provide .
i ordered the corned beef hash which was fantastic .
i will be back and appreciate their offerings .
both the meatball sub and her turkey were good .
it always hits the spot .
we grabbed a shot of <UNK> and left .
the food here is amazing .
both burgers were great .
this is where they lost a star .
"overall good experience , especially the burger ."
foot traffic noise in this hotel is exceptionally bad .
here ' s where it gets really bad .
you can do much better for the money .
another teriyaki joint for some healthier fast food .
at least more rice to fill the bowl .
cool place to stay .
- lrb - 00 dollars - rrb - .
bad service made the average korean food horrible .
never again will i go here .
the wifi at hilton was exactly the opposite .
i really enjoyed this place .
the bread / bun made it even better .
but everything else is worth the visit .
best bread / dough i have eaten .
but i had to make it happen for her .
i ' ll make this simple and quick .
"0 : lobster tails , and crumb cake ."
topped with condensed milk .
this starbucks certainly meets that standard .
theirs is quite good .
great memorabilia exposed all over the place .
the pasta dish with shrimp was also a hit .
nice decor and ambiance .
great atmosphere and service .
the coffee was unusually good as well !
just the right atmosphere best views of the strip .
hibachi was i better than any chinese buffet .
same size as the carne asada burrito .
definitely worth a visit .
tasty home style food for a good price .
good diner type food .
the green chile quiche was excellent .
"small spot in az mills , with tasty <UNK> ."
"small spot in az mills , with tasty <UNK> ."
next time im getting a <UNK> !
service was a tad sketchy .
that would be a shame .
i ' ve always enjoyed the food here though .
then they just did what i wanted .
that ' s what i want from a mechanic !
shut your whore mouth .
all as they come .
"yeah , i see that ."
you charged me double .
that ' s more than a mistake .
$ 00 at the door with drink .
lousy service lousy people .
and the representative started making excuses .
edit : i ' ll be adding more soon .
then you had the dealer at the craps table .
i was standing about 0 to 0 feet back .
do n't you touch my f * cking phone .
- rrb - free wifi of course .
what more can you ask for ?
the beer selection is extensive .
"great prices , speedy service , good customer service ."
"great food , good and quick service ."
you might really like what you find inside .
but they have their advantages .
"all in all , its a good little restaraunt ."
but the food would be worthwhile going back for .
but the hush puppies were great !
"good job <UNK> , keep it up !"
the guys here know their craft .
need a special grind or cut ?
it had the perfect balance of sweetness and heat .
as far as the food is concerned .
the food was tasty and top quality .
all in all a great dining experience .
this is a very understated place .
the prime burger is the best burger in montreal !
the ambiance is well suited to all needs .
the food is splendid and quite original .
<UNK> so very good .
the taste was also out of this world .
"awesome food , great flavor and reasonable prices ."
i support small business but come on guys .
"oh , plus they price match ."
not just competitors but the internet as well .
i actually received more than i expected .
what more can i say ?
unfortunately this was not the case .
this place is awesome .
i agree with <UNK> c . ' s review .
food was great but service was horrible .
recommend checking them out for bringing bagels to work .
what can i say about this place .
three girls just standing around doing nothing .
why buy the vip and wait .
like others i expected way more from rob zombie .
amazing array of food from breakfast to lunch .
i do n't forget people who do great work .
the french onion soup is fantastic as well .
this place is fantastic .
"we had the red bull roll , highly recommended ."
another great dinner at my favorite indian restaurant .
the place is very professional and clean .
nice service and relaxing atmosphere .
"egg dishes rocked , especially the huevos rancheros ."
great roadside joint in a rather odd little neighborhood .
big drawback is the distance to the strip .
but for my business trip this was absolutely ideal .
unfortunately they served me a pile of wet mush .
gordon had me like woah !
must also give credit to the wait staff .
this is one of the best .
thanks to <UNK> and jen .
"oh , and a projector screen ."
the beer : the draft selections are numerous .
did i find the best burger in vegas ?
small corner shop probably enough for 00-00 people max !
"curry , rice , and choice of meat ."
do n't expect anything else .
four and a half hours delay .
never will fly us airways or american again .
this is some awesome pie .
you ' ll be bringing some home .
i highly recommend them ! ! .
"seems easy , right ?"
"goodbye , century link ."
they are courteous and respectful .
the rooms are suitable for a downtown hotel .
horrible car wash here .
good job chili ' s staff .
well this location does n't deserve even a star .
that should have been the first sign .
this review will be short and sweet .
now for the breakfast fare .
definitely enough for two hungry people .
you wo n't regret it .
this is a must when you visit lv .
both times service was slow and uncaring .
delicious food and a wide selection of local beers .
the lemon aioli complemented the lobster without overwhelming it .
"the ambience is typical urban upscale , nicely done ."
"still nothing , until i discovered those guys ."
"first , let me commend the service ."
it came out drowning in dressing .
"unfortunately , they taste like crap ."
now i ' ve learned my lesson .
"first , the food ."
"wow , what a <UNK> of mediocrity ."
the bacon-wrapped dates tasted awfully generic .
"' ' no , no , and hell no ."
the menu prices are all very reasonable .
"lobster is lobster , you say ?"
"however they prepared it , this lobster was amazing ."
blt definitely <UNK> my image of phoenix steakhouses .
i wo n't be returning to izakaya go .
the pulled pork and beef brisket are both winners .
my experience with lenscrafters was far superior .
"most important , my corrected vision is now <UNK> ."
the steak was first rate .
but the <UNK> verdict ?
"both baos are great , pork belly and duck ."
the bun is $ 00 and surprisingly small .
"good , but more artsy than tasty ."
"yeah , that ' s a <UNK> of food ."
"taste : 0/0 , value 0/0 ."
"yeah , it ' s that good ."
cops cruise up and down las vegas boulevard constantly .
so why the review ?
"the chorizo was fine , but nothing spectacular ."
"obviously , no wood grill at <UNK> ."
"that said , i will probably come back here ."
"at this point , words fail me ."
the staff gets an a + for effort .
there are countless restaurants in las vegas .
"- rrb - , were terrific ."
"what ' s barbecue fraud , you ask ?"
"bbq fraud is baked , as opposed to <UNK> ."
enjoy your 00 bucks of crap .
"if you want great italian , go elsewhere ."
"first , a basket of <UNK> © s ."
the dijon vinaigrette offered as dipping sauce was tasty .
"aces & ales is ok , but just ok ."
clear <UNK> and new tint .
best prices in town and best staff anywhere .
highly recommended with confidence .
this is the place for you .
the pizza was very good .
the balls are great .
the curry chicken was bomb .
was a nice treat from out of town .
a + + + no <UNK> shorts allowed .
claims to be a public place .
good luck with the biz with there hater style .
got the prime rib and soup .
"and speaking of mountains , try the pancakes ."
great coffee served in a bowl .
the brisket was awful .
the portion size was absurd .
the cole slaw was bad .
thai rama is above average .
<UNK> ' s is very good .
great service and value .
<UNK> ' s : recommended .
"bad food , worse service ."
i decided against it .
i will never return to la fonda .
keep up the good work .
<UNK> ' s pretty much sucks .
downgrading my initial review substantially .
the <UNK> could be an instant classic .
the space and the setting are really stellar .
just fucking bring it .
it ' s an awesome place to hang out .
i live in the neighborhood .
i happen to know the difference .
food was good not great .
her scallop entree was very good .
"bread pudding dessert was great , but not memorable ."
i ' ll update this review if i do .
i mostly enjoyed my meal at cowboy ciao .
he returned fairly promptly with the right bottle .
squid ink was surprisingly good .
the tahoe roll flavor wise is superb .
we sat inside as a result .
keep up the good work .
keep up the good work !
i have waited over an hour for this .
great food and great staff as well .
00 the crunchy onions in your beans .
waited 00 minutes for two drinks .
could this be the nicest cvs format ever ?
five stars environment off the strip in chinatown .
not the best ramen i ' ve had .
brussels sprouts - excellent .
this could be it ' s own meal .
apps bone marrow - excellent !
marinated very well and just the perfect serving .
french onion soup - very well done .
the piece of meat was exceptional and tender .
sides green beans - garnished with almonds .
comes with awesome parmesan cheese fries .
salads kale and corn + chicken - surprisingly filling .
chicken curry - good curry .
western rock and roll theme with a large bar .
breakfast does n't get much better .
i live in squirrel hill .
the staff is exceptionally friendly .
i thought a comparison might be in order .
my wife does n't like barbecue anything .
recently moved to charlotte and <UNK> is the bomb .
absolutely love the huge pizzas .
i had a great experience at mr brake .
need advice on your next kitchen adventure ?
it lived up to its billing .
the service is fast and the food is great .
this is the authentic jewish deli experience .
<UNK> ' s is old school and great .
the steaks were huge and the fish was fantastic .
treat yourself to a classic dining room experience .
it was passable at best .
i really dug this place .
one of the old time spots that still rocks .
made tool sound even better .
"convenient parking garage , clean rooms , good coffee ."
service is always great .
"thin crust , many options , fast and fresh ."
dr <UNK> is truly great .
been here 0 times already .
twice for lunch and once for dinner .
very quick and simple .
its moderately priced and the food is fucking delicious .
i had the hanger steak and it was amazing .
drinks are creative and have slight southern flare .
worth experiencing for vegas sake .
"all were good , but nothing special ."
but you pay for that twist .
the breakfast that was included was pretty good .
she was horrible from the word go .
http://url the pastries look and taste incredible .

. 00 cents per oz .
does n't live up to the hype .
the food looks amazing in the pictures .
the bed was incredible .
the room was awesome .
much larger than a standard hotel room .
really friendly people at this place .
. if you are really really hungry .
the fresh made street tacos were average .
the smell of their products is incredible .
they suggested meeting at either fez or <UNK> .
the outside seating is pretty cool .
maybe because the location is somewhat hard to find ?
the place is awesome .
it ' s a fun place with good food .
people no <UNK> the luxor .
i ' m a fan of this place .
this place is now strictly for adults .
i was on the 00th floor of the pyramid .
definitely nothing like it around !
great place to grab a quick sandwich .
plus the room was very clean .
plus outdoor seating during the right time of year .
great location within walking distance to many restaurants .
but at this place it works nicely .
the place is large inside and never really busy .
this place is kinda hard to review .
did it blow me away ?
kinda like a plot from a bad horror movie .
the teachers there are all amazing .
old fashioned inside but classy not hokey .
shade tree techs at this shop
overall was good will come again .
slowest moving dairy queen i have ever been to !
the food was absolutely awesome in every way .
their website says they are open till 0pm .
she proved me wrong .
"costly , boring , <UNK> ."
the she crab soup was excellent .
the service was simply atrocious .
the wings are unbelievable and they are not small !
the <UNK> ' s sauce will light you up .
. it is hot .
"she offer cuts , washes and style ."
i highly recommend going here .

run by a bunch of unprofessional kids .
food was precooked sitting out cold .

too big for the box .
after several visits never had a bad meal again .
their pizza is superb .
"unfortunately , it was a <UNK> ."
greg the bartender ignored us for 00 mins .
great portion sizes great meat cuts .
and the name is pretty funny .
honestly as a former chef .
"also , ray cooper the drummer was great !"
this is not acceptable .
i got the irish coffee milkshake ... bomb .
underwhelming by a mile .
try the tiramisu i guess ?
you will not leave unsatisfied .
would i recommend this <UNK> ?
i had a good time seeing the <UNK> here .
- this venue was really enjoyable .
i put back alot of that money .
of course alot of them looking sad .
i thought yeah a bit overpriced .
it was time to end all the fun .
it was pretty cool going down to old vegas .
"convenient location , i was staying right near here ."
yeah this place is horrible .
the one in vegas is worse .
- tourist trap central .
animal style fries are the best ever .
i hardly played anything else .
this place is slightly away from the strip .
mac and cheese was pretty good .
"mostly top 00 , but not anything particularly good ."
yeah basically fuck this place .
my last rum and coke was almost empty .
"i know , where has this guy been ."
drinks were expensive but that is how it is .
vegas is a real nice spot .
"heading in the direction of <UNK> , you know ."
my last time on the strip was 0000 .
the playlist <UNK> chose was excellent too .
she was a local vegas chick there .
. i said it .
great service considering how packed it was too .
. very good price here on this car wash .
- free vacuums as well .
breakfast food is what sold me here .
i have always liked the flamingo .
the volcano is the main attraction here .
it is not the best to gamble here .
alot of eye candy for the fellas to absorb .
kind of off the beaten path as they say .
that was win on the way out of vegas .
i put away some food and kept smiling .
this place was really cool .
went here on a saturday <UNK> . 00th .
"i heard this place closed , that is unfortunate ."
it tasted great as well .
so the word is out there .
it was horrible actually seeing this again .

i just could not figure it out .
it was a nice room and all .
nice flat screen tv .
"great crowd , alot of <UNK> here that night ."
00 floors up is the tag line .
the place is very small but warm and inviting .
the sushi was decent but the servings were minuscule .
which was quite good .
and then it happened again .
sorry this is a late night rant .
they referred me for <UNK> to investigate the problem .
decent pizza with enough variety .
not the best pizza ever but good enough .
absolutely the best brunch spot in vegas .
stack did not stack up .
not for what they charged .
the fried chicken was way below average .
the wings was also below average .
this hyped up restaurant will fade out soon .
i workout everyday for thirty minutes .
i am not a heavy lifter .
the place is always spotless .
my wife is going in tonight for hers .
guido makes the world ' s best sandwich .
the burro xavier ' s way was awesome .
the stingray exhibit is worth the money .
this place deserves some yelp love .
i tried the meatloaf for lunch .
"well-made , <UNK> and great garnishes ."
this is the italian restaurant in charlotte for me .
"the inside seating , not so good ."
the texas brisket in particular is my favorite .
"once again , no explanation , no apologies ."
"the food is excellent , well-prepared and consistently good ."
"the paella was very good , recommended ."
it ruined an otherwise excellent meal .
the hanger steak was cooked properly and to perfection .
"we like longhorn , but not this location ."
the service here is mediocre at best .
00 more minutes to get plates .
my caesar salad was sour and otherwise bland .
the pizza is great .
sell you another beer ?
"unless , of course , you eat here tonight ."
i hope they get the service mess resolved .
karaoke dj sucks balls .
no profanity in vegas .
"no , that is not an exaggerated number ."
this place deserves 00 stars in my book .
these guys are very professional and really nice .
italian beef with that heavenly liquid cheese is great .
lots of irish beers available .
will definitely return to sample the steaks .
had a nice local beer selection .
this place always performs .
wish the creme de poblano was around more often .
"still good , great hush puppies and cole slaw ."
not as good as irish <UNK> but still good .
certainly worth the wait .
great special occasion place .
service was just as incredible as the food itself .
"a little bit pricy , but as i said ."
a great special occasion place .
food always tastes great and is always hot .
"well , i finally made it to cowfish ."
the wife got an iced coffee with almond milk .
definitely some fresh ingredients handled with care and expertise .
settebello has always treated us well over the years .
the outside building is unassuming to say the least .
both times have been great .
i must thank the wife for originally ordering it .
the haves versus the have <UNK> i guess ?
this review is based on two visits here recently .
the wife had the mole glazed tempeh .
i choose the bacon wrapped filet of horse .
the wife also got a vegan carrot cashew muffin .
food is ok at best for me .
i look forward to many a return visit .
the wife and i really love this place .
the staff is always energetic and upbeat .
the leek and mushroom sandwich was calling my name .
when i ate the leftovers .
we certainly did not feel rushed .
everyone was pleased at the table flavor wise .
"needless to say , that streak is still alive ."
a few tips : 0 .
"the oysters were good , fresh and reasonably priced ."
all of the seafood was fresh and perfectly cooked .
service at the bar was great and attentive .
every sandwich was better than the next .
the service was attentive and timely .
the citrus and salmon worked perfectly together .
again everything was expertly prepared and taste phenomenal .
we were there for seafood to include raw oysters .
we used the cocktail sauce and mignonette provided .
this is another great spot for beer lovers .
maybe a second location in noda ?
hopefully that means expansion with some more seating .
the wife had breakfast <UNK> which she enjoyed .
i had a burger and it was just a-ok .
service was great and attentive .
"better luck next time , i guess ."
need i say more in regards to decadence .
i may have just found the spot .
the other 0 were great and very flavorful .
that was the good part .
the not so good part is the lunch options .
all of which was at a premium price .
more like great food on montford !
till next yrs mon night games i guess ... .
old school feel atmosphere .
ordered a pastrami sandwich and also tried the cheesesteak .
got to get an iron city light too drink .
if you like gin get this drink .
everything was very good but overpriced .
the price is more than reasonable .
their teas is very good .
prices are not vegas steep personally either .
definitely recommend giving this place a try .
the value is out of this world .
there are 0 levels from novice to almost <UNK> .
much props to this circle k !
just look for the yellow building on east charleston .
very highly recommended ! ! extremely friendly staff !
grab a sandwich from the deli are good .
staff often approaches me asking if i need anything .
they ' re attentive and nice .
membership dues and monthly dues are extremely low .
their fountain drink selection is huge as well .
it ' s very cool and unique to vegas .
you ca n't walk to the strip from here .
it ' s a nice place .
<UNK> brothers i hope you are on yelp .
just a bad property .
rooms are second to none !

i highly recommend you come and try it out .
you ' ll be back again if you do .
they have a really good wine list .
and have beers on tap .

how the mighty have fallen .
all the good and bad reviews were true .
the sushi is fresh .
the food is prepared fast .
our waitress was ashley and she was great .
helpful with the menu and with our kids .
one roll can feed two .
folks are very friendly .
could have stayed someplace else for less .
so check for <UNK> and emails featuring savings codes .
"the restaurant in concord , nc is great ."
stopped in for breakfast .
"price is right , and service was quick ."
i could get used to this place .
not over played or crowded .
good value for money .
everything was in good condition .
the greens are very challenging .
the chicken strips were small but juicy and good .
the fries were regular crinkle cut fries .
' ' one star added .
i may give these guys another try .
my wife ' s burger was pretty tasty .
the fried were just bad .
i had a couple of beers .
the service was very good .
these two things keep me coming back .
"overall it ' s just ok , not great ."
i got no problems with this place .
service was pretty much perfect .
my wife had the strip steak which she loved .
she always has a - 0 on her steaks .
favorite beer i had was guinness foreign extra .
like regular guinness but with more hops .
i had an amazing meal there .
set me up with a flight of beers .
i always get the <UNK> slab .
service has always been really great .
on the down side .
service was pretty bad too .
wife had chicken fettuccine alfredo .
good caesar salads too .
"he cut my wife really , really badly ."
all the beers were tasty and full of flavor .
"did not stay , just played ."
"played blackjack , roulette and craps ."
pit bosses and dealers were clean cut and friendly .
"solid place , but nothing amazing ."
no one was around but the slot machine guy .
after a while longer the cashier arrived .
i do n't own von ' s stock .
if i did i ' d sell it .
they are very helpful to hotpot newbies .
do n't waste your time .
better items at the local outlet mall .
restaurant ambiance is typical for steakhouse .
i would not recommend .
the view will also impress your out-of-town visitors .
needless to say not a good sandwich .
this dealership has been great to me .
the food was excellent .
the staff very friendly .
this is a must-go place .
at least a dozen .
many places with a monopoly slide into mediocrity .
not a good place for kids .
among loads of people dressed like cowboys .
dancing and milling and drinking .
maybe it was from not eating .
what an extraordinary resort this is .
you buy much more than a room here .
this is a cheap trip to disneyland .
but certainly not for the food .
it ' s entertainment disguised as a restaurant .
those alone are worth a trip for dinner here .
best fajitas i recall having anywhere .
great food for a very good price .
i had the ribs with mac and cheese .
i also tried the hot wings .
i highly recommend adding a par 0 chipping green .
free wifi for only 0 devices ?
i had the rib eye 00oz steak .
great food for a decent price .
very unique experience i must say .
i came with some buddies on 00/00 / 0000 .
internet access was solid .
room service was good with decent pricing .
this experience was worse than awful .
<UNK> . for a home we purchased recently .
most of the smoke <UNK> where not working .
my main concern was the safety issue .
i found jeff on yelp .
both ca n't break at the same time .
i have more things to do to my truck .
! ! ! the place was jammed !
got the mongolian beef excellent .
a good place to get some warm supper .
you can not leave vegas without eating here .
the waiters were great .
what ' s not to like ?
all come with french fries and hush puppies .
to sum it all up : quantity over quality .
both times were for an early dinner .
perfect in every way .
there is - greatness .
the food was great and timely .
working at summerlin crossfit is awesome .
you wo n't be disappointed .
these guys were great .
walked me through the possible reasons for the issue .
"good , but just not great ."
the food is bland and really has no taste .
house drinks were also very good .
come to the tahiti .
stay away from this business .
its main concern is making money .
the rooms are comfortable and modern .
nothing amazing but solid and tasty .
my only real disappointment was the hostess and wait .
they had difficulty honoring a number of groups reservations .
avoid it if you have had the real thing .
okay in a pinch .
i tend to look for quality instead of quantity .
"0 , bistro at <UNK> ."
best service as well as very good quality .
"however , their selections are considerably less than <UNK> ."
food is like any other buffet .
"do n't know , how long they will last ."
food is just average .
overpriced like all bellagio restaurants .
"so , what aria have is nothing new ."
such as compact room compare to other newer casinos .
what is <UNK> thinking of ?
this is considered a high end steakhouse .
half of the 00oz steak was that of fat .
they were playing a music in the steakhouse .
and ruth chris just opened up at harrahs .
go everywhere else but here .
still no response from local dunkin .
excellent and service was great .
some of the best pizza you will find anywhere .
no tint no hatch ?
shame on you buddy .
the wait staff was friendly but slow .
at least the beer was cold .
. the french toast was great .
. i ate the best grits in the universe .
best part was the waitress angela yelling .
buy tickets to the show .
you wo n't be disappointed .
seems to be a common problem for most people .
- rrb - were provided after each cleaning .
it just got a little expensive .
why do i keep coming here you ask ?
and they still got the order wrong .
tons of people in the drive through .
this place needs to be on mystery diners .
everyone just looks at me and looks away .
"ambience is good , and music is soothing ."
"food is great , service is quick ."
and it was a tasty burger too .
to top it all its expensive .
all adds up to a three star rating .
what more could you ask for ?
excellent food and great service .
i dont recommend this place to anyone .
"shabby and dirty , food is very average ."
not good when plate is hotter than the steak .
the food is fresh and proportion is just right .
all the appetizer ' s where cooked perfectly .
they have a man walking around making balloon figures .
"the food was ok , nothing outstanding ."
the water park is the highlight of this resort .
bathroom also has separate glass enclosed shower .
all i can say is wow .
this place is awesome .
there are 0 or 0 restaurants in sls .
i ate at 000 degrees pizza .
no real restaurants to speak of .
overall was a great trip .
great place to grab a drink on the strip .
that would suck worse .
"well , neither is the ac ."
should i up my review ?
now de - <UNK> in phoenix .
"but , i doubt it ."
not even a free drink on board .
hope you enjoyed the read ... .
"that said , this place is adequate ."
similar to an ihop or a denny ' s .
prices maybe a little better .
"also , should n't have ordered the cole slaw ."
do n't forget to fill the tank .
they actually serve your food on a skillet .
this is a happy hour specific review .
i travel all over the us and western europe .
"eating this , was going through some empty <UNK> ."
this is a surprising place .
this was a legendary experience .
' ' what a mind % & !
the raw tuna nicoise <UNK> was great .
"as asian buffets go , this is very worthwhile ."
the crawfish in the bouillabaisse were <UNK> !
the kitchen is <UNK> .
"that said , the <UNK> is horrendous ."
the salsa bar is another contrast in wonder .
i keep going here .
so was the spring roll .
"great service , nice <UNK> , well-prepared food ."
- you can eat inside or outside .
- the thick taco was interesting and almost satisfying .
a twenty covered it including tip .
"nice looking oven though , and great service ."
it is not a 0 - star place .
the truly odd thing about <UNK> are the aesthetics .
what decade is this ? ? really ?
they seem to be very competent and honest .
very quick and efficient repair service .
"she is an excellent , caring physician ."
"fantastic pub , great crowd ."
beer selection was really diverse as well .
the temperature inside was a bit uncomfortably hot .
a second piece was similar .
went to <UNK> this evening with some friends .
service was very attentive / good .
quite good restaurant for a number of reasons .
their friday fish fry is amazing .
"when i go again , i ' ll update ."
and their sandwiches are very good as well .
or maybe <UNK> are just deprived in this regard .
pretty good selection of vegetables .
this restaurant wins in its category .
<UNK> taqueria had both in excellent fashion .
amateur night is the time to go .
i ' m a fan .
chipotle with hawaiian ingredients .
i like their kahlua pig and chicken protein .
i like their salsa variations .
the bangers and mash pasty was a letdown .
the food here is good but overrated .
got a gyro meal .
the beef and lamb were really tasty .
unlv id card gets you a free drink .
"other than that , it was cool ."
really really good coffee and shakes .
really good hot dog .
it might be too clean for my liking .
the service is great .
the homies for sure .
"top 0 goes lengua , tripa , and buche ."
the mariachi band on mondays is a nice addition .
yellowtail collar is strong .
the food was whatever .
"solid fajitas , decent margaritas , good service ."
forgot which one but this place rocks .
regular price is $ 00 .
got the 0 - for - 0 special .
but the food is just too good .
got ta go back for more later on .
this place is too bomb .
pretty darn good lunch combo .
had the chicken katsu as well .
this place rocks i went here with a group .
they had a ton of good authentic korean food .
that just <UNK> the line .
the pizza is doable .
earls is always a nice place to eat .
"plus , there toppings are fresh ."
nothing really stood out .
service is good though .
the service was bad .
solid taiwanese hot pot .
i had some pizza and pasta .
it has some nice qualities to it .
never knew a place like this existed .
it was nothing special for $ 00 .
great lattes and a great place to work .
had the roy ' s trio .
same goes for the mac and cheese .
i ' ve done plenty of work here .
it ' s in the plaza .
carl is a cool dude .
one of the better station casino buffets .
i would really give it a 0.0 .
it ' s fun to watch movies here .
overpriced sushi that ' s average .
the service was spot on though .
the gyro was good .
service was good but the food was average .
great brunch i did n't see the appeal .
nothing stood out in my opinion .
"plus , my patty was overcooked ."
the food was nothing special .
the service was crap .
i found my hu <UNK> spot in vegas .
