great spot for before or after movies .
their menu changes nightly .
we stop everytime we are out in chandler !
it was the perfect escape from the work day .
stay elsewhere and just visit the casino and bars .

it was a refreshing bed of greens .
we ' ll order again i ' m sure !
overall we really liked the food .

not so at <UNK> !
there ' s fantastic art to be seen here !
"all in all , wait was n't too long ."
always love their stone crab and bread

a warning : it is spicy .

back then the playboy club served dinner and such .
so much easier than using our bath tub !
huge selection of fabrics .

i love this place !
they should n't force things like that .
both had enough flavor and tasted delicious .
best pho i ' ve had !
the service is okay .
let me indulge a little !
the huge chocolate fountain caught my eye .
service was friendly and efficient .
everything was just fantastic .
i always get mine with mashed potatoes .
there were remotes to control the whole room .

"cute , helpful and attentive ."
it definitely held up to its name .
we ordered an appetizer and two burgers .
we were so disappointed when we left ... .

one of the bartenders made us some amazing shots !
a generous two stars for the experience !
my friend had the ravioli .

the meat looked and smelled like dog food .
a fun and refreshing treat !
its like the little caesars of fancy pizza .
i ordered the 0 enchilada special .
so we decided to go with all pro .
why are they so slow ?
plus that way i could go more often .
the casino is huge !
this place is a must !
we ordered a pizza and two desserts .
the employee told me the shoes were just misplaced .
"the broth was so tasty , seasoned perfectly ."
"great food , pretty pricey , but good quality ."
i ' m really proud of myself !
never fails to be a fun time over there .
depends on who is there i guess .
i will never eat here again .
both were the right amount of sweetness .
do not give them your business !
i truly believe they saved my moms ' life .
it was super tender and seasoned perfectly .
so he gets a slice .
and it ' s right off highway !
. and the portion is very small !
after that experience i vowed to never return .
talk about a lovely bonus and souvenir !
i have had nothing but great service there .
that coconut waffle sounds good .
loved the egg ' s benedict california style .
the homemade jam was awesome !
restaurant - little pricey .
i always get an iced brew .
i will not go back .
could have eaten that whole bowl myself .
i was n't able to finish it .
i will never be back .
"normally , the service is okay ."
i got sick - - the culprit !
they only provide valet parking .
"overall , i would not go back ."
"much later , a different server took our order ."
i really want to like this place .
reasonably priced for the time spent there .
this is a little favorite of ours .
the scallops were <UNK> too salty .
she could not stop raving about it .
i enjoyed the gumbo too .
i highly recommend them .
i ca n't wait to go back .
we had no <UNK> of theft either .
and the people are friendly !
* miso chilean sea bass is to die for .
great soup and homemade cheeses too .
it was mostly tortilla and very little filling .
bad customer service let you tell you that .
everything else was just okay .
i love anyplace with a little atmosphere .
"will be back , often ."
husband got the tinga burrito .
the biggest downside is the set up .
and $ 00 credit for my next stay ?
popular casual chain pita spot .
today we got ` ` the works ' ' .
delicious bagels and coffee !
the ability to test on site for things .
it was a mess .
i had french toast and it was amazing .
be prepared to get messy !
"he was very professional , thorough , and punctual ."
maybe they ' re dessert crepes are better .
the root vegetables were out of this world .
everything i tried was amazing .
the sunday bartender is awesome .
would i discourage someone else from going ?
"fantastic , i need to call them again ."
customer service is great .
the shop is adorable !
pros : - food !

so i got kicked out .
we decided we ' d share the lobster carbonara .
this salad was just very sad .
it was also nice that my stay was free !
- rrb - which were good .
the waiter was a doll .
one of the best frozen yogurt places !
the place is entirely too cramped .
thanks for a wonderful evening out !
the agua fresca was amazing .
"sadly , it was mediocre ."
this is such a great place .

"thanks , mac , for hooking us up !"
yeah it ' s fantastic .
but the place needs some work .
the scallops could n't be bigger or tastier .
we ordered the roasted carrot appetizer to start with .
go checkout sassy nails there amazing .
only stop for vintage addiction .
they were out of basically everything .
after a solid frickin ' hour we just left .
eggs benedict are delish too .
i also really recommend the pecan pie ... fabulous !
chimi was a little too deep fried .
definitely will be going back .
this place is fantastic to look at .
although it was incredibly delicious !
what a fun place !
this time it definitely <UNK> !
i love this place !
the tomato soup is out of this world .
then i found sakana ' s .
it took a while to get our check .

their favorite pancakes are from ihop .
the sink was one of those bowl sinks .

i thoroughly enjoyed the back patio .
they ruined my dogs hair .

i guess their employees hate money ?
$ 00 for everything removed .
i further than megan with the flower bar !
next complaint is the service .
the cheese curds were delicious though !
"eh , but it was average ."
everything i dreamed and more .
moral of the dramatic story !
i always come here when i go there .
he had a great voice !
definitely an overrated restaurant .
even loved the modern music they played for ambience .
we were also lured here by living social .
the noodles were n't even traditional ramen noodle .
the facility itself is huge !
i refuse to go anywhere else !
i ' m really torn about this airport .

"now , i . love ."
you have to go visit for yourself !
chicken wings : okay .
