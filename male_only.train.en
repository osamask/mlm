i ' d use this place of business again .
this business was very highly rated and rightly so .
great food when you can get in .
the pasta was fresh and tasty .
salt & pepper calamari - delicious .
the kids devoured these .
will be a staple on subsequent trips .
water boiled fish - this dish was phenomenal .
starts slow & builds & builds .
"great , great dish ."
great way to end the meal .
super reasonable as well .
"super nice people , fantastic food , great value !"
does n't mean i ' m an expert though .
it is one case .
these are ridiculously addictive .
the food was excellent all the way around .
they had a couple of soups that sounded wonderful .
i ' m a fan of china lite .
i ' m a fan of <UNK> ' s .
"love the standard cheesesteak , typically go extra wiz ."
"good bread , ample meat , love the wiz ."
ca n't beat the wiz .
the bun of the beef bun itself was fantastic .
that was a good while ago .
had some work colleagues ask to meet here today .
my biggest problem was the menu itself .
it may be great .
so the birthday fail begins ... one more thing .
food is a big deal .
this was also my wife ' s birthday .
"so we ' re in good shape , right ?"
it was about 0:00 .
"ok , i get it ."
might have <UNK> in a bit ?
just seems like such a customer service failure .
they were super helpful on every visit .
i understand this is a classic dish .
"first of all , aji here refers to peppers ."
this term is used all over the place .
kind of a crazy dish .
also some fried yucca slices .
this is a great dish .
super tasty with a bit of spice .
this was another great dish .
"loved it , especially the subtle hint of spice ."
think this will be a staple order .
the kids also liked it quite well .
rotisserie chicken - killer rotisserie chicken .
i became a huge fan of these immediately .
i actually liked a bit diluted .
the food was respectable .
the dishes were excellent .
the onion soup was also similar .
we hit it last night after the yelp rocks !
they were soggy & grease laden .
maybe my expectations were out of whack .
had a nice meal here today .
chips were good and were replenished throughout .
was n't the case here .
the decor is killer .
the pasty itself was excellent .
"i foresee many , many visits in our future ."
this is so not in my ballpark .
pretty hard to mess that up .
kind of a meager selection at the pasta bar .
so not the case .
"ok , i give up ."
they probably did n't care anyway .
ca n't go wrong .
washed it all down with a <UNK> .
"vikings , packers , etc . on the walls ."
this place is 0000 % right in my <UNK> .
focus on getting that completely right .
focus on quality ingredients .
maybe my expectations were way out of whack .
no problem with the pricing or portions .
would have happily eaten more .
and maybe i ' m unfair for expecting them .
then i tried the two entrees i most wanted .
both had gotten rave reviews in a recent article .
that was what i was expecting here .
or a linguine with clams .
they also sell them .
their confections also come daily from lux .
turned out to be amazingly lucky .
the preparation was amazing .
rabbit confit & <UNK> - absolutely love this dish .
the burrata <UNK> was amazing as well .
so that ' s saying something .
chinese fried chicken was good as always .
steamed fish was nice .
was just underwhelmed on so many levels .
i ' m a big fan of chow fun .
just did n't really make an impression .
i appreciate it for what it is .
fries and onion rings are great .
this review is years overdue .
he also has a bunch of killer kitchen tools .
i ' m a fan of village tavern .
i ' ll get these wherever they have them .
it was n't awesome but it did the job .
no raves for any of the food .
might be great for some .
"ok fine , end of story , right ?"
opened up the box & started salivating immediately .
it was definitely waygu in all its glory .
"luscious , tender , flavorful , amazingly rich ."
he ' s growing 00 varieties of heirloom tomatoes .
perfect as the days are getting hot .
chef ben is awesome .
they ' ve become a weekly staple .
also quite enjoy the excellent waffles with it .
pretty much everything was a hit .
big fan of fry bread house .
the fry bread is just flat out amazing .
cheap great food super quick .
their food is excellent .
"super tasty , reasonable , quick ."
their carne asada is also brilliant .
they have a nice salsa bar as well .
going there just gives me the <UNK> .
little bit of <UNK> in that .
"ok , but nothing special at all ."
my favorite is likely the white flannel .
another corned beef hash version with jalapeã ± os .
in fact it is too hot .
so many other great sandwiches as well .
i ca n't get enough of this .
ca n't find fault with that .
they were actually quite good .
i ' m a fan of those .
they were fine but nothing special .
good beer on tap .
very cool decor as well .
they know exactly what they are .
they do n't try to be anything else .
i ' m a fried rice junkie .
"great experience at the phoenician , specifically il <UNK> ."
i say get the green chile burro .
they are open only m-f from 0 - 0ish .
jeff is always there .
the arrangements are always a great value as well .
i ' m a fan .
was quite refreshing and tasty .
the prosciutto was a killer touch .
that was also very good .
the bread accompanying was great and a nice compliment .
the beef was awesome .
could n't add the spot with the same address .
was definitely the case .
just a great end to a great night .
the sushi is fresh and good .
the salads are great .
fries are also quite nice .
i really dug many of the dishes .
the service was good as well .
that is 0 grades up from their basic wash .
sat there for quite a while .
then to the front windshield over and over again .
i spent another 0 minutes vacuuming the car .
<UNK> uneven application of who knows what .
lousy work and complete lack of concern .
they are pretty strict and have a set curriculum .
it seemed much more than toast .
inside was interesting as well .
definitely had a huge local feel .
they also had a couple walleye dishes .
totally got her approval .
"the fish was moist , mild & tasty ."
nice big ` ` chips ' ' .
no pasties or sausage rolls .
closed : the one eyed dog is gone .
we are huge fans of cartel coffee lab .
cartel roasts their own and does a ridiculous job .
their roaster also sits out in full view .
broth was weak with no depth of flavor .
big fan of anything that goes late .
actually went quite a bit past midnight .
this was a killer sandwich .
also had the marinated short rib with steamed buns .
i <UNK> cleanup for a couple people with these .
just flat out awesome .
also subject to <UNK> rate increases .
how cool is that for a drive through ?
both were quite good and quite affordable .
they were all quite good .
that is a dangerous drink .
i ' m a big fan of lychee .
that was killer as well .
service in the <UNK> lounge was also quite excellent .
the decor is modern and tasteful .
that ' s not the case with roka akor .
the <UNK> fried pork belly is completely ridiculous .
they also have a bunch of great drinks .
the staff has been super nice and super attentive .
i ' m also a big joe <UNK> fan .
the setup of their little market is very cool .
i left for the day with no charge .
this store is a joke .
the owners really care about you and it shows .
the eggs suffered from a general lack of seasoning .
this place is great !
this place is horrible top to bottom .
chefs very nice and work extremely fast .
it ' s not your average ghetto chinese buffett .
the food was barely edible .
. and i start trying a little of <UNK> .
one thing - the oaxaca burrito is n't good .
here ' s the deal .
each pizza was crafted by chris bianco himself .
every pizza was made by his hand .
that was the magic .
' ' then blew me a kiss .
i do not fault him .
the tragedy is there is only 0 chris bianco .
i ' m typically a new york slice snob .
it is not new york pizza .
if the owner reads this - thumbs up .
it ' s not fishy at all ' ' .
the remoulade was excellent .
probably the best i ' ve had .
' ' this is true .
falafel is topped with tahini .
maybe 00 at a good restaurant .
the <UNK> were good .
it ' s total sex .
sometimes sex is nice .
the menu is pretty simple .
"well duh , i ' ll get a cheesesteak ."
so i began taking it .
i never knew it could be this good .
it was n't too hard and tough .
something akin to 00 am to 0 pm .
". checking back at 0 , still closed ."
the egg rolls are mammoth .
almost as big as a coke can .
the next night i brought friends .
the duck is good - however it is <UNK> .
wah sun - no comparison .
treat the lady like you would your mom .
the food is that good .
only a 0 star average for this place ?
god help you if it ' s summer .
the rice is the best in the city .
this place is literally a black hole for time .
it took 0â 0/0 hours .
find a different one on yelp .
"mediocre , at best ."
certainly not worth the money .
the food however was top notch .
attentive but not pushy wait staff .
a poor decision to me .
i do need to comment on the service .
the tapas menu is now one page .
the back patio was closed .
this is probably my favorite restaurant in pittsburgh .
nice ambiance and great food .
and bottles of wine are reasonably priced .
will not be staying here again .
thank you jim and thank you yelp ! !
not a intermission in those minutes .
phantom theme song plays !
one star <UNK> for this reason .
"great selection , friendly staff ."
this review is for the management and the bouncers .
so why did he take my name down ?
okay let ' s just believe in that bullshit .
more days go by .
it was messy as hell .
i ' m a meatball sandwich aficionado .
this cheese had some flavor to it .
i thought it complemented the meatballs very well .
really nice flavor to them .
the food is cheap and tasty .
this place is good .
we got a table right next to a speaker .
now that ' s what i call service .
this place is a lifesaver .
waitress was on top of things and friendly .
do n't eat the prime ribeye .
- bumpy as hell .
he is the epitome of buyer be ware .
he is a used car sales man by definition .
danny <UNK> took care of me .
"good breakfast restaurant , well prepared food ."
and the food quality is very good .
"simple food , tasty , with very good service ."
nice job for a chain .
the guacamole is very good as it should be .
my wife and i split the <UNK> platter .
more than enough food .
only complaint is we made a reservation via yelp !
two burgers were ok .
seriously the burger size is stupid small .
the <UNK> cut fries were just ok .
"0pm sat afternoon , running errands stop for lunch ."
restaurant is half full .
food quality : tasty and interesting .
that ' s not a chinese chicken salad .
dined here late on a sunday evening .
"great taste , good service ."
"this is one of my favorite restaurants , period ."
went to downtown summerlin location based on a recommendation .
really did n't meet up to our expectation .
interesting casual dining concept .
"excellent food , very casual atmosphere ."
but from that point its amazing .
they have much better competition in this location .
smoothie is very good .
a great local spot in chandler .
they have a ton of sauces to choose from .
the red lights are a unique touch .
i will not visit your location again .
"through this process , the representative was unresponsive ."
this business is basically a scam .
what to expect about the atmosphere .
nearly everyone is topless .
this office is top notch all the way around .
today the <UNK> / heat game is on .
pool temp was very comfortable and refreshing and clean .
will be back for sure .
i initially thought she was joking .
a year ago this place was great .

"decent food , decent-sized portions , reasonable price ."
famous dave ' s offers both .

this place is a scam .

service could use some work .
the food is mediocre at best .
decent place for the most part .

on the west end is the westin kierland .

prices are on par with other froyo places .
meats are delicious and cost a bit more .
knowing the parking layout is n't easy .
<UNK> system is inconsistent .
better than almost all other airports even .
been to yardhouse three times for lunch .
it has never taken less than an 0:00 .

"all were very good , though not remarkable ."

about 00 minutes later your dish arrives .

"that said , salt is indeed tasty ."

the <UNK> bbq sauce was <UNK> .
the front staff made faces and <UNK> at her .
sandwiches were sloppy and lacked flavor .

off we went to yelp !
good overall and service was above par .
"will visit , again ."

"first , they all look alike ."
nice shop and staff .
still worked out superbly .
installation was completed quickly .
that ' s the good news .

"cost is a little higher , but not bad ."
one memorable things is the food .

insert coins is a <UNK> place to hang out .
the food is pretty good .
i ' ll link it all below .
the hotel is very dated .
food is very bad .
management can care less about a customer service .
thought we would try again but to no avail .
i miss you <UNK> sushi guy ...
the coffee by the elevators were a nice touch .
the humor was stereotype racial and gay <UNK> .
the <UNK> has a high pitched <UNK> voice .
lunch selection was limited .
just what i was wanting .
paid 00 $ for poor service and poor food .
the food has a very earthy flavor to it .
i come here alot but have n't yelp it .
being a native to chi town .
it ' s da bomb !
thats probably the only draw back i have .
i have cut the stars from 0 to 0 .
juice bar is cool .
. he ' s the go-to guy !
"very professional , informative and nice ."
extremely easy to deal with them .
we found this office through a web search .
had our first appointment yesterday .
"very pleasant , professional people ."
"great place , and always look forward to returning ."
my wife had the taco salad special .
great place and we look forward to returning .
the magnificent pizza comes hot out of the oven .

"they can make it very far , i believe ."
waited 00 min between courses .
no <UNK> or hand washing .
burger was tasty but very small .
jeff <UNK> is the best !

in the past the menudo here has been great .
waitress was very friendly .
cod fish and <UNK> were very good .
first do n't be be defensive about feedback .
huge selection of deserts .
however <UNK> they are an epic fail .
the food was a true <UNK> culinary experience .
five stars does not do it justice .
a must visit if you ' re in vegas .
still a decent dinner choice on the strip .
and then there was wade .
"tasty cheese , rather uninspired omelette selection ."
"an excellent , well-organized , <UNK> restaurant ."
"ladies , give it a try ."
"good times , kids , good times ."
not awful pricing either for airport food .
small burritos at airports rock .
"ok , cool , mission accomplished ."
best fries east of san francisco !
beer is fantastic as well .
will always come back here .
could n't ask for better quality and price wise .
. i wont order from them again .
that is either poor planning or <UNK> or both .
not a good sign .
the waitress was nice enough and adequate though .
i have had better and worse .
"but hey , one cant have it all ."
its well worth the travel though .
would go back and would recommend to anyone .
"not a big deal , but something to mention ."
you can smoke cigars here !
this was almost the highlight of our vegas trip .
"awesome bar , $ 0.00 00 oz <UNK> beers ."
i am never going to play golf at <UNK> .
great service and close to my home .
kevin the bar tender was fantastic !
they should be ashamed of the fee games !
the cure lived up to the hype !
run fast and far if you have the option .
fuck the haters <UNK> out .
i could not be happier .
me and my greed .
all within close proximity .
five minutes for water .
this place is bad a $ $ !
the flavor was great though .
they seemed to be missing some flavor depth .
"overall , their yelp reputation is well deserved ."
wait was approximately 00 minutes .

but this guy is almost useless at this point .
a big black dog that shed a lot .
carpet in one room was black .
pay this dude after you are totally happy .
"big job , right ."
not ` ol rick .
rick over promises and under delivers .
net loss several thousand dollars .
i should have known better .
he can clean your carpet .
all the companies use similar equipment .
it will be crunchy when he is finished .
"will he vacuum before , no way ."
"rick ' s offer for damage , zero !"
let rick stick to simple carpets and carpets alone .
dude get off the phone and finish the job .

"great haircut , nice experience ."
so obviously this place is <UNK> .
the food is gon na be thrown out .
unless it is used again the next day .
do n't bother with this place .
but wasted $ 00 .
the wings come out fast enough .
that ' s to their credit .
this is at the highest echelon of wing dining .

these guys really know their stuff .
do n't complain about what is posted .
canned food served slowly .
food is always cold .
it is just as amazing as it seems .

this place is tucked in a ghetto looking mall .
excellent mexican kosher food .
near to the strip .
"beautiful resort , landscape well kept ."
"good food , friendly service , <UNK> feeling ."
"first the bad , and then the good ."

hopefully i was just there on a bad day .
"excellent food , service with a great atmosphere too ."
the service and attitude of the waitress was excellent .
what a total rip off .

great location on gilbert rd . .
great sandwich and very friendly staff .

this place is better than most .
i would also say the store is generally dirty .
perhaps the town could replace these .
i had a choco protein shake .
we own several properties - commercial and residential .
we have been using <UNK> plumbing for several years .
they are honest and competent plumbers .
great service and awesome personal .
i was n't too hot on the ketchup .
"not with that line , at least ."
"this place is kinda cool , i guess ?"
"well , assuming it is n't a game night ."
the italian fare had some passable sausage & peppers .
"gumbo was good , nothing that blew me away ."
see those 0 stars up there ?
the bacon wrapped dates are <UNK> good .
i scanned the place for him - nada .
looking for something to fill your <UNK> gut ?
of brisket at once .
the brisket itself was plentiful ... and plenty lukewarm .
how exactly did my food come out barely hot ?
it ' s a plate of brisket .
i have found the seventh circle of hell .
and people were eating it up .
they were eating up that shit .
"' ' it was , admittedly , kinda thoughtful ."
"bread was a bit tough and chewy , though ."
i probably should have gotten a burger or something .
"that was cool , made for some nice ambiance ."
i laughed and left when informed of this .
the scotch egg was killer .
this blew both of those away .
"too bad , because the steak pie was delicious ."
"yes , this place is overpriced ."
made for a nice hearty breakfast .
does anyone really need any of this stuff ?
check-in was slow and <UNK> .
the rooms are decent .
we had a pretty good view of some mountains .
"and , yes , the prices are grossly inflated ."
"this was <UNK> , to say the least ."
they had a great selection of foodstuffs available .
"like , something am / pm would serve gross ."
the <UNK> squares were ok .
that must be the magic number here .
great late night spot .
want to eat but still maintain your buzz ?
check-in was done at vegas ' usual slow standards .
"and , best of all , a 00 oz ."
each piece melted upon entering my mouth .
"potato and beans were both great , too ."
hard to beat a deal that good .
"happy hour rules here , though ."
this is a must .
' ' the old woman looked perplexed .
"' ' , she <UNK> inquired ."
"` ` sir , stop ."
put it on the belt .
this is a fantastic hole-in-the-wall .
all of the above was sufficiently cooked and tasty .
they ' ve got a big menu .
i gave this 0 stars last time ?
and the buns they use are way too rubbery .
how can this be easily ruined ?
this is not the case .
like king crab legs ?
meal # 0 : pink taco plate .
i want to say they were chicken .
the beer is bud light .
sounds like a winning combo to me .
drink was decent enough .
"good spot to relax at , but nothing more ."
"the rooms are nice , but far from decadent ."
parking was great here .
the lazy river is more like a crowded stream .
so i ate it .
tasted pretty good ; nothing too noteworthy .
"decent breakfast , moderately priced , acceptable service ."
the interior looks similar to tower records .
"oh , almost forgot a funny story ."
"so , where do they display this crucial information ?"
on the back of my waitress ' order book .
a couple fucking tvs .
"- rrb - , not space out on crap ."
"get with it , guys ."
who the hell designed this ?
self parking is around back .
"it just looks ... well , pathetic , really ."
"way to make an entrance , guys ."
who the fuck are they kidding ?
"well , any other cheap ass hotel ."
"luckily , the sake made the meal worth it ."
we made a horrible mistake .
this place is death .
there is nothing on this planet that even compares .
"yes , chicago , that includes you ."
"pretty good crust , though ."
is this the best vegas can do ?
decent does n't cut it for me .
i ca n't grade on a relative scale .
ordered a half dozen oysters to start .
"good sauce accompanies it , though ."
i had the meatloaf .
do n't bother with a day pass .
"food came , and it looked like hammered shit ."
we got a small pizza and some chicken tenders .
these were much better .
"staff here was awesome , too ."
"the food was good , not great ."
why would any place assume i want butter ?
the wings here are really good .
trust me on this .
my chick went with the popular <UNK> sandwich .
and i think some nuts might have been involved .
the food here was adequate in quality and price .
not to me it ai n't .
i hate places like this .
"and even worse , these were like tissue paper ."
"steak - pretty good , nice spices ."
the carpet is new .
the elevators are old .
but it does n't get any channels .
i will say this : it is a hotel .
but avoid it if you can .
this is cuban food .
enjoyed everything about this place .
<UNK> - tools used were not <UNK> .

great take on bbq comfort food .
the chicken pita was fantastic .

and not <UNK> in a good way .
"the cheese was ok , the tomatoes were flavorless ."
"great atmosphere , great food ."
my personal favorite is the ruben sandwich !

plentiful scallions and tofu rounded out a wonderful start !
massage is good for the soul .
"not bad , not great ."
thank god for this place .
"well no , i can say more ."
the quality of the ingredients is high .
the fish was fresh and of excellent quality .

"but uh , who watches tv in vegas ?"
this thing was massive .
definitely worth getting along with the ramen .
my gf got vanilla .
not cool at all .
a very awesome deal for an awesome meal .
"avoid the giant clam , my gf disliked it ."
the sweet shrimp nigiri is unique and different .
<UNK> roll was pretty much a spicy tuna roll .
"not far from the strip , slightly down flamingo ."
0 $ black jack and pai gow !
the deal was quite a steal .
- alaskan king crab legs : $ 00 .
when your entrã © e comes out .
we tried the buffet at a very discounted price .
sushi mon does n't do this .
highly recommended you sit at the bar .
giving this place a visit was wayyy long overdue .
there ' s many different levels and sections .
think tao club on steroids .
reservations were made for 0:00 pm .
- mac & cheese : awesome !
guys with running shoes and polo ' s .
for a buffet it is great .
extremely disappointing and frustrating experience .
another 00 min for the 0d .
"strangely , they send me to the ticketing manager ."
"bold flavor in simple , fried pockets ."
"dirty tables , soiled floors , and bad food ."
the wife ordered a turkey club sandwich .
safe bets considering this is our first visit .
then came the food .
and that ' s about it folks .
i went there last night for dinner .
"up sale , up sale ."
these two guys did an amazing job .
the guys here know there stuff .
all the food is good .
if you get a chance go there and eat .
i ate there this morning .
this is how hipsters do vegas .
this place is a solid 0.0 stars .
for sure get the fried chicken and waffles .

the coffee that they used was excellent .
i loved the cow art all over the restaurant .
great beer selection also .
the meat options were insane .
they had a variety of sausages which were amazing .
the prime rib and ribs were really good .
the dim sum area was surprisingly good .
the service and the contemporary design was amazing .
the local gay bar in vegas .
"from past experiences , all locals go to <UNK> ."
good : the strippers are dancing right behind you .
best atmosphere by day .
night feels more like sports & spirits bar .
these folks are as good as it gets .
i may have to return just to visit them .
"excellent prices , excellent service , excellent quality ."
easy to reach on the phone .
we will never use another ac company .
really well put together .
amazing flavor and the perfect amount of heat .
it was this good even 00 mins before closing .
now that ' s dedication !
i always get breakfast burritos .
"pro : quick , friendly service ."
some options not exactly as described in menu .
that <UNK> is pretty bomb !
excellent little breakfast and lunch place .
friendly and fast service with a nice atmosphere .
the brunch special breakfast burrito is fantastic !
i ' m going to agree with <UNK> .
best horchata in the us .
"come on dude , do i really have to ?"
is this what they do here ?
this place was amazing .
i got 0 out of 0 here .
the beer was good .
"dude , do you fucking canadians even yelp bro ?"
my wife and i ate at georges recently .

old ladies with their tops off ?

its good authentic mexican food very good atmosphere .
all i could taste was artificial sweetness .
very elegant and great atmosphere inside .
price point is great .
one was flat out cold .
the bell staff are responsive and kind .
the price here is the best part .
the rental car area is way off site .
the food was excellent .
i ' d recommend the red robin .
it was out of this world .
let ' s start with the basics .
"in short , it really let me down ."
their restaurant certainly matched the ambience of the resort .
"dark , warm decor , rustic feel ."
i had the 00 day dry aged ribeye .
she tried the salmon and was equally impressed .
service is personal and friendly without smothering .
a wonderful place with an ambitious chef ... .
this place is the best .
meaty mussel meat and the sauce was quite flavorful .
beware of the blonde girl named sam !
the upstairs there is usually a live band playing .
there are a bunch of good beers and drinks .
its a site that needs to be seen .
chima is the best restaurant in charlotte period .
the big pieces of meat are cooked every way .
their draft selection is pretty awesome .

what more can you want ?
very solid chinese food .
i am now pretty sure he is hooked .
which is a filet mignon sandwich on ciabatta .
that is alcohol fooling your <UNK> .
i ran into <UNK> legend at triple c brewery .
the skewers were massive .
the outside section is where this bar shines .

"though , on to the good ."
i especially enjoy the <UNK> .

people are yelling and things are just a blast .
the appetizers are decent here especially the mussels .
this place is n't that bad .
my chicken cheesesteak was pretty good .
the setting is great .

want triple c <UNK> in pints ?
tree lined <UNK> and amazing houses .
it must be some type of <UNK> .
their crab soup is out of control .
"now lets get to the bulk , the steaks ."
i asked for medium and they cooked it perfectly .
"beyond this , the service was outstanding ."
plates are about $ 00 - $ 00 .
this to me is the best one in charlotte .
the food list is decent and is way different .
they have their own kitchen separate from the upstairs .
so why four stars ?
thanks sunset club for putting me through hell .
"unlimited bowling sundays , and the leagues are varied ."
all of us but one got the <UNK> burger .
there were a good selection of beer on tap .

<UNK> i pushed the red button again .
the people next to me were getting quite pissed .
the next beer came up quick .
suprisingly the first beer was added back on !
"now , thats a good mac n cheese !"
here are the things they need to approve upon .
good place to get tuned up before the flight .
though i started to suspect the food .
everything was still very good in the short time .
"this place has burgers , sandwiches , and pizza ."
what happened to $ 0 chicken nachos ya <UNK> ?
not just coffee is a great place .

this place is quickly becoming one of my favorites .
best stinking ruben this side of ny !
"seriously , these guys make great sandwiches ."

the two large shrimp were cooked very well .
now to the food .
this place is a over priced .

"i had a caesar , my wife the house ."
worst pizza i ' ve had in pittsburgh .
i would highly recommend any of these dishes .
"as usual , these were great ."
been to many different del tacos here in phoenix .
this place caught me by surprise .
i had my favorite cigar shop across town .
here you feel like a vip .
i ' m a new regular for life .
there are several <UNK> egg sandwiches and lunch options .
both were very good .
solid djs and bartenders .
although the wynn bathroom did seem a tad larger .
this is a very nice cozy asian place .
the food is prepared fresh and fast .
my personal favorite is chow mein .
i wish you guys the best !
generally these are <UNK> / competitors .
this is the best strip club in the country .
anyone who says otherwise is a <UNK> / competitor .
me : that ' s great .
good luck and have a nice night .
- lsb - five minutes later .
consider me captain karma .
the service is exceptional .
' ' but what more can you say ?
i ' ll be back .
the food was incredible .
four stars for the food .
the service was wooden .
they were also uninterested in refilling my diet cokes .
wine and beer prices are very good .
ditch the fish and 0 stars is within reach .
thumbs up on this place .
i was able to walk-in .
this place was a quarter what everyone else charged .
we chose a reasonably priced 0 hr time slot .
"finally , a great , honest auto repair shop ."
"red alert 0 , not good ."
someone needs to call the health inspection .
highly recommended and great customer satisfaction !
i know since i did my research .
not a bang for your buck anymore .
first and last time here .
"chicken sandwich was ok , not to flavorful ."
keep up the good work !
owner was able honor their bogo promotion .
if you have not tried it .
pass the word on .
great hotel with great views .
the food at their restaurant was below average .
must tries : the pancakes and the hash browns .
"yeah , i dont know ."
". i said ` yes , please ' ."
it didnt seem like the marinade ran very deep .
"also , korean bbq is expensive ."
i cant visit pittsburgh without dropping by sharp edge .
"yeah , i said it ."
skip the resort fee and try this place out .
they say that consistency is the hallmark of excellence .
just a fantastic establishment with friendly people .
what more do you need ?
very much a steak and potato place .
skillet cookie was top notch .
eat here at your own risk .
: - rrb - noisy atmosphere but very tasty .
a must try for the snack eater .
"in short , i love this place ."
my girlfriend and i went there this week .
great place for people 00 + years old .
i had the veal .
coming from an east coast guy .
"if you puke , you clean it !"
the food was subpar and generic at best .
both the ladies there know what they are doing .
my wife went there for service .
the service rep was arrogant and pushy .
check out the reviews of their other locations .
good luck doing business in ballantyne .
"it ' s not their fault , either ."
that last group was alcoholic .
"very , very alcoholic ."
some were very interesting .
he was going to read his writing to louis .
` ` i was in the neighborhood .
` ` let me see what you got there .
"come on , give it ."
"' ' he <UNK> , clearing his throat ."
` ` no ' ' shouted david .
' ' louis announced <UNK> .
` ` they ' re on vacation .
"period , end of discussion ."
this place still deserves five stars .
they make going out work .
everything <UNK> t . said .
two and a half stars .
very good both times .
this place is far better with more variety .
food : 0 star .
"loud , but that ' s what we expected ."
it is always very good and consistent .
the service has been the same as well .
to boot the order was wrong .
food was mediocre at best .
called this morning to arrange a cab for tomorrow .
"oh yeah , prices ... very reasonable !"
i was quite unimpressed with the fare .
at least the service was decent if unenthusiastic .
had the big lenny sandwich and it was great .
then the entrees came in .
"the new terminal is large , which requires walking ."
baggage claim was quick and painless .
some i remember playing in pizza shops at home .
the restrooms were large and clean .
i wish i had one of these close by !
i like the casino floor with its lofty ceilings .
alter to the gods of liquor and beer !
the store is well lit and very clean .
pretty much our worst restaurant experience of the year .
this is a very dishonest company .

great tasting comfort food at great prices .
"and the coffee is , indeed , good ."
"i visited scratch for brunch yesterday , may 00th ."
: - rrb - please visit scratch and enjoy !
"to my surprise , the room was quite decent ."
the casino itself is n't really a casino .
the portions are quite large .
it ' s a very eclectic place .
this is an awesome restaurant .
like several hundred dollars .
but it was worth the experience .
it ' s extremely delicious .
this restaurant appears to be a family operation .
the tofu scramble was pretty good .
this is a no-frills hotel and casino .
i prefer the old name .
it does not cover the cost of internet .
it was a very clean room with comfortable beds .
the wifi connection was easy to pick up .
the casino itself is very basic .
my hotel room is decent .
everything is fairly clean and comfortable .
the casino itself is full of <UNK> people .
this is n't one of those places .
there are many buffets in vegas of this caliber .
all the furniture and linens smell like cigarette smoke .
the tower room was very decent .
"this was a very decent , <UNK> hotel room ."
the wifi in the room was also very good .
the casino itself is fairly standard .
there are a number of nice places to eat .
none of the items were bad .
the restaurant itself is small but very pleasant .
the cashew nut was also quite tasty .
it made the place look like a factory .
the food in this place is also really good .
"good beer , good appetizers , good pizza ."
this was also a nice place to watch football .
the wait staff was very friendly .
this place is outstanding !
all of these items were excellent .

juan and ray are the best .
"wow , what a great piece of history ."
perhaps the best breakfast on the east side .
during this <UNK> a moment of pure <UNK> <UNK> .
during this <UNK> a moment of pure <UNK> <UNK> .
baked potato was huge and very tasty .
salad was very big and fresh .
sometimes selections are thinned out by 0am .
good steak if you do n't get out much .
needs to study business management .
avoid the little old lady in electronics !
blu ray or dvd ?
well you want it or not ?
alamo car rental was superb .
overall this is an awesome hotel / casino .
they have a good menu with many different options .
"beef stroganoff was rich , full of tender steak ."
"beef stroganoff was rich , lots of tender meat ."
we had a great meal here .
service was top notch .
review to come later ... place holder for now .
close to nellis <UNK> .
very nice place to stay .
"it was good , but not exceptional ."
i had the bowl mixed with chicken and steak .
very convenient and the price is right .
"salsa was good , and the beans were beans ."
this place is the bomb !
taste sushi at the ayce places then come here .
this guy is what you want in a bartender .
comes down to service and the guy delivers .
sit at the bar if you can .
this is a review on the deli .
there is raw meat there .
the lasagna is crazy good .
my wife got the pear ravioli .
"two for two , people ."
a little <UNK> without trying to be .
the desserts are classic italian and fantastic .
bartender was a nice guy .
too many options to make this a go-to .
the sushi here is great .
"from a food perspective , this place seems solid ."
"if management reads these reviews , take note ."
"other than that , top notch place ."
staff is not real responsive and moves pretty slow .
was in and out of there in 00 minutes .
"the perfect ending however , are the deserts ."
the menu says eggs your way .
that really means any way as long as scrambled .
the whole breakfast was marginal at best .
it was also excellent .
just had their lunch buffet .
"they were severely undercooked , and barely warm ."
so far quite good .
another when the part came in .
i took the car back in .
this place is simply fantastic !
it ' s really that good .
his constant banter is a welcome change !
the egg sandwich is expertly done .
ca n't recommend this place highly enough .
nothing was special care .
nothing unusual at all .
$ 00 bucks and some change .
' ' got the <UNK> tacos ... cuz vegas .
the wife ' s fajita was also fantastic .
"all in all , highly recommended ."
i keep coming back .
probably the worst service i ever had .
this place is a shit hole with shit service .
i also waited 00 mins with two other customers .
every bite was filled with carne and sour cream .
and of course a large cup of minute maid .
"on the plus side , its only $ 0.00 ."
its your basic sports grill .
i just need my new license .
why ca n't you just simply do it ?
four words : i love this place .
but no big deal .
the burrito was full of sauce .
- rsb - = still hot .
overall i actually like this place .
i rolled my eyes as we entered .
first thing was a nice blast of cold air .
"the line was slightly long , but fast moving ."
and the bacon and cheese was delicious as well .
it enhanced the meal perfectly .
"in the end , i was satisfied ."
the price matched the quality .
oh and its quite affordable as well .
the bbq chicken is perfect as well .
"its light , not overbearing ."
check this place out .
you will not be disappointed .
- 0 for initial placement .
the whole <UNK> theme was nice and consistent .
except for all the stuff behind the bar .
the service was decent .
"ok , i thought ."
not a bad atmosphere except for the large crowd .
"all crap , even the tea ."
worst chicken i ' ve ever had .
also they are cheaper .
00 minutes later i got my pizza .
the slices were pretty big actually .
the taste however was n't special .
instead i bit it and it easily came apart .
i noticed the same thing with the peperoni .
it was flaky and crumbled nicely in my mouth .
overall it was n't a bad pizza .
also i want to try the wings .
but it was busy .
and everyone seemed happy with what they were eating .
also it smelled good in there .
the hush puppies we fresh .
"also the sampler had chicken , which was ok ."
the clam chowder was very good .
but we felt like it was too cold .
like they should have heated it up more .
overall this place was a fantastic find .
honestly i ' ve never heard of this place .
the soft interior filled my taste buds with delight .
but that ' s to vague .
"however they did it , it worked ."
powdered sugar not overbearing .
pancake was also pretty good .
this place has become my spot .
so maybe their tied ?
the place is a quiet place .
good place to try if your a sandwich lover .
but its an oink cafe .
that means pig coffee to me .
i want bacon and an espresso .
or bacon or coffee .
the layout was odd too .
our server must have been a rookie .
<UNK> me at least .
also know you product and services .
salad was good enough to give a three star .
or maybe just to johnny rockets or something .
west gate has way better selections .
this holds true especially when it comes to bbq .
but not for bbq .
not alot of places to sit though .
the menu is pretty simple .
overall the cost was $ 00 .
and two 0/0 lbs of sausage .
the pulled pork was ok .
both sausages were quite good .
very good bbq eatery .
- lrb - rootbeer floats anyone - rrb - .
i rate this place a 0/0 .
unprofessional and judge mental to customers .
chris is as good as it gets !
keep up the good work !
good sliders and chili cheese fries awesome pizzas .
get the <UNK> or the bbq chicken .
you can taste the fresh ingredients .
some pretty good tacos .
reminds me of san francisco china town food .
so far best italian restaurant in phoenix .

my kids loved sitting at the hibachi table .
shrimp and scallops were very good .
first time i have been to this establishment .
the environment is very pleasant .
the veggie udon was good and plentiful .
elevate has plenty of room to breath .
they are the best at what they do .
on to the food .
he was very courteous and friendly .
the rest of the staff were friendly and fun .
what can i say about the location ?
i liked the bikes .
a very nice relaxing place to have dinner .
i ordered the classic 00oz burger well done .
i tried to finish it but failed .
the cost is only about 00 dollars per person .
this is a place i will visit again .
the cashier was very friendly .
dollar for dollar the best deal in vegas .
the price was right the service was great .
the service was excellent .
wow 00 for a carne asada burrito .
being charged 0 dollars for 0oz coke .
i chose three barbecue pulled pork on flour tortillas .
"wow , never will i order from dominos again ."

something that tri is missing .
le <UNK> sushi <UNK> en <UNK> .
<UNK> et <UNK> de <UNK> !
the milk version taste funny .
every roll we had was unique and delicious .
went to ditch fridays here .
drinks were expensive as expected but worth enjoying .
the view from up here is pretty awesome .
went to the bank on friday night .
what a waste of space .
whoever imagined this place was sorely mistaken .
the fries and shakes are definitely where zinburger shines .
"oh , and , their shakes mean business !"
"do no harm , right ?"
seems pretty typical of this place .
customer service is professional and friendly here .
i had the chicken entree .
". booth , of course ."
i was just blown away .
keep up the fantastic work ae chandler !
"thanks for the awesome <UNK> sandwich carrier , btw !"
all of these items live at this store .
did i mention the place was slam packed ?
"oh yeah , did i mention the pancakes ?"
- rrb - matinee movies are $ 0 .
the outrageous sauce is phenomenal .
i had a chicken burger stuffed <UNK> style .
note : the veggie burger is not stuffed .
i look forward to my next visit .
it ' s kind of hit and miss .
i certainly do n't anymore .
every hour on the hour church tours are provided .
the church is stunning .
they crack me up .
"sure , why not ."
sticky toffee pudding ale ?
"that ' ll do , pig ."
what ' s going on ?
that guy was on his game .
the floors : are they being mopped in beer ?
how is this location even still in business .
do n't leave without getting some .
"yes , you can tell this place is new ."
perhaps a few degrees warmer would have been nice .
should n't need a jacket inside a building .
you brought charm to chandler .
there is n't a bad one in the bunch .
the seasonal options keep every visit interesting .
no wonder this place was practically empty .
the donuts definitely did not look fresh anymore .
<UNK> is simple food that is done impeccably well .
the place is fantastic !
otherwise the place is typically not crowded .
the store is large and well organized .
the staff is friendly without it being annoying .
i ' ve never seen it empty ever .
the staff is friendly and polite .
it all started back when chandler mall opened up .
since then it just keeps getting worse .
"they are quick , fast , and friendly ."
no other will do for her .
"holy crap , i just do n't care !"
why ca n't the dmv be this nice ?
- rrb - yogurtland is cool - pun intended .
the yogurtland app is rather helpful .
"joyride , what are you doing ?"
i ' m way happier with your food .
"sad times , jr . ."
- rrb - minus a star .
it ' s why we like you .
why did the chicken cross the road ?
does anyone have a recipe that even comes close ?
' cause today is sunday .
to find out what it was all about .
it was very good .
no line at all on a monday around noon .
it ' s simply mesmerizing to watch .
it does n't change the adult quota stock points .
the negative : we visited on 0/ 0/00 .
"of course , no refunds are offered ."
excellent place to spend a saturday night !
steak and eggs for breakfast was excellent .
the dinner special was even more incredible .
eat all your food or face the consequences .
the staff is extremely friendly and courteous .
i ' m not talking about a little fat .
highly recommended if you ' re in the area .
i recommend this place to anybody at any time .
0 stars with the potential of 0 stars .
i ' ll be back to <UNK> .
i always get the western .
a memorable meal for two at under $ 00 .
sorry about all the hype .
the beer prices are reasonable .
the show is decent to good .
perhaps a little over priced .
a word of caution about the bath / shower .
great spot to get off the strip and unwind .
our coffee and water were empty for long periods .
empty plates sat for a long time .
the wife got the brussels sprout salad .
i will be back for sure .
i have travelled around the world .
this place is close to ideal .
"i ordered food on sunday , early evening ."

ambience is opulent without being stuffy .
will be back next chance we get .
dropped by at 00:00 am .
received product at 00:00 am .
i bet they were hoping i would say no .
this franchise should be closed asap .
i contacted wendy ' s corporate .
staff and hostess were courteous and attentive .
"meatballs were unremarkable , dense and without great flavor ."
i had a brisket plate .
selection of sauces was real good .
absolutely awesome old school place .
you want a good hot dog ?
i ordered the special with hand cut fries .
here is breakdown : ambiance is ok .
"the food , amazing ."
"food , staff and atmosphere all get a 0s !"
they got the meal to us quickly .
overpriced for what we got .
also the menu changed .
"the food is great , the price is fair ."
the selection is great as well .
and my lunch special general <UNK> chicken tasted off .
the second time i brought cash !
my third and final time was today .
also note that this visits were several months apart .
would not recommend to anyone .
the beef was nowhere to be found .
the bun was cold and should have been toasted .
fair price low quality food .
"service sucks , cashiers have attitude ."
very cheap and very stingy people here .
fair price low quality food .
very cheap and very stingy people here .
the dentist mark also has an attitude .
"fresh ingredients , <UNK> service ."
this place is absolutely amazing .
"the beef , the prime kalbi ."
never had a mistake with my order .
i have an asian zing addiction .
service is quick even through rushes .
and the green tea ice cream was also good .
especially for plumbing jobs .
one side was completely round and smooth .
"light and crisp , excellent flavor ."
great place for dining with friends or family .
their tapas are creative and delicious .
radio is all about the flavor and passion .
"to me , that ' s much more important ."
we will certainly go again .
it ' s not a hot dog joint .
i love the hot dogs at jj ' s .
"they ' re well made , and delicious ."
i usually stick to 0 dogs and a drink .
"rocket sauce , bacon bits , and cole slaw ."
"loads of variety , and well made and presented ."
you wo n't regret it .
best taco spot uptown for sure !
the pork belly is fantastic .
"pork buns are really great , too ."
that would get me coming back more often .
these are not to be missed .
tell ' em i sent you !
the rest of the menu is essentially irrelevant .
those sandwiches is so damn good .
want coffee in your room ?
who charges for in room coffee ?
hope it burns to the ground .
lay off the vinegar !
had a terrific sunday roast .
daughter had good bangers and mash .
good service as well .
this might be the best pizza west of ny !
i grew up in boston and lived in ny .
"excellent restaurant , the food authentic mexican ."
the food was excellent with great flavors .
the food was excellent when it finally arrived .
so the service was inadequate to say the least .
"always a tasty burger , awesome customer service ."
food is pretty good .
service is on point .
good luck to the next person .
"decor is cool , 00s theme ."
service is pretty good for the most part .
the food is very good as well .
lots of selections to choose from .
<UNK> is a great dessert .
this place is highly recommended .
absolutely fantastic ! ! ! the food was amazing .
- rrb - and some sides .
and of course there is cold beer .
the place is kind of a maze .
sat at the bar .
ordered the homemade fried chicken and a burger .
everything was truly superior including the service .
super clean modern airport .
yes i agree with all the 0 star ratings .
thanks for all you do .
however this did not change where i do business .
the atmosphere is <UNK> and business like .
"great beef , cooked perfectly , and seasoned plenty ."
the <UNK> ' s were great .
the skirt steak i will save for last .
two of the most easy going friendly dudes ever .
same goes for the pit boss ' s .
the drink service was quick ... maybe too quick .
i started with a caprese which was very fresh .
the highlight for me was the sashimi .
for $ 0 the portion was great .
the main reason is price .
i will say the apps were pretty good .
it was probably below average .
my wife went with the porcini rubbed rib-eye .
"pretty solid , i ' d order it again ."
good sashimi and plenty of rolls with spice .
kaizen was my first ayce sushi visit in town .
pretty tasty food and reasonable prices .
nothing bad to say about bayside .
the wait in line is very short .
the only knock is the omelet line .
"still , only hitting on 0/0 appetizers is underwhelming ."
"unfortunately , it really misses the mark here ."
the tuna was high quality and cooked rare .
the consensus favorite dish might have been the butterfish .
the wife went with the chicken and waffles .
it was even good left over the next day .
second time through bb took a step back .
the real bummer came with the service .
i would recommend the pork ribs over the beef .
definitely just an average sandwich joint .
absinthe is also unique because of the crowd interaction .
overall i waited about an hour and twenty minutes .
the balance of sweet and heat is perfect .
virtually all crab and a terrific cajun lobster sauce .
pros : solid bar area with several large tvs .
the asparagus was nothing special .
this place is <UNK> .
the hype is real .
nice place tucked away in town square .
definite diamond in the rough .
cinnamon bun was average at best .
then what exactly is your job ?
awesome sandwiches had an amazing time at the sls .
completely gutted with a new air filtration system .
also great pizza and burger joint in the casino .
"sunset is exceptional , especially for vegas standards ."
"great job for midnight , 00/00 will have again ."
this place has become my wife ' s obsession .
all which are great .
the food was excellent .
it ' s a real treat .
jay was informative and great to deal with .
your crew did an outstanding job .
did i hear that right ?
at first your like bills ?
the hell is that ?
at there business site .
casual dining at it ' s best .
"great view , food , and service ."
a great neighborhood restaurant .
- rrb - would be here by tuesday .
looking for a burrito in las vegas ?
these were tight and stuffed .
"in a word , appalling ."
elevator button ` ` p ' ' please .
what ' s that smell ?
carpet covered in cigarette burns ?
door numbers written in with <UNK> ?
a drunken 00 ' s drag queen on meth ?
0nd <UNK> with a box of melted crayons ?
this place was great .
this place needs a genre of its own .
it sets the standards for chinese cuisine .
would not go anywhere else .
i highly recommend this shop .
artie is truly a master plumber !
second time at this location and still impressed .
to watch some balloons getting blown up ?
good luck with that .
a complete rip off !
the bread base is amazingly fresh and tasty .
tonight ' s experience was worse than usual .
very good ice cream and good prices .
quality service at an affordable price .
great company with great employees .
i ' m not just throwing up five stars .
excellent food and service .
tacos and daily special with pesto soup were great .
"it is rough , bumpy , and annoying ."
"moist enough , but not soggy ."
i hope this business does well .
but this is not that place .
not that it needs to be either .
august found me a used unit that works perfectly .
i highly recommend del sol .
well at least it was cheap .
a good time was had .
steak dinner for 0 bucks ?
lots of interesting characters at this place for sure .
"carne asada burritos , chips and fries from so ."
cal are the stuff of legend amongst my friends .
and they also accept credit card .
# 0 <UNK> noodles were ok .
little flour taste to then .
he could use some anger management courses .
this place is the worst .
great place with full of locals .
chris was very <UNK> and her irish accent genuine .
stellar service and impressive menu .
an excellent meal with friends .
that ' s what stood out .
we probably wont try another place in las vegas .
great breakfast on the strip .
no idea about anything else .
the mini baguette was very good .
my wife loves the cheesecake here .
great place for coffee with a lot of ppl .
partner had the oysters .
oysters are far better if they are really cold .
"it was piping hot , if somewhat bland ."
he had the fish and chips entree .
far too much for substandard seafood .
"you can do far , far better ."
what others say about noise is true .
the dining options are very expensive .
it clearly shares a kitchen with the buffet .
but it had a buffet feel to it .
"great fries , good sandwiches ."
coffee and breakfast sandwiches for two was $ 00 .
a relaxed dive atmosphere .
no douchebags in sight .
i ' ve given it multiple chances .
the soundtrack / music is excellent too !
it does n't make logical sense .
great news that <UNK> is coming to scottsdale .
great news that <UNK> is coming to scottsdale .
"these guys are the best , bar none ."
wonderful neighborhood italian restaurant .
<UNK> 0000 - am has some great shows .
"good programming , <UNK> ."
they did a really nice job with the burger .
the whole meal was very satisfying .
these guys took me to the cleaner !
"no explanation , no apology ."
no repeat business for these <UNK> .
i like the shack ' s character .
the idea just was n't executed that well .
just a very poor selection .
the concept is brilliant as a matter of marketing .
great cut at a good price .
great place with a great mission : sustainable seafood .
but the dish was fair .
"so anyway , do n't get keys made here ."
"first , a big shout out to the decor ."
they did a fantastic job with the interior .
- the grilled cheese we ordered came out cold .
not much more you could ask from a diner .
the tomatoes were hard and without much flavor .
those are the spots for charlotte bbq .
what an outstanding place this is .
just another green surprise in charlotte .
if it were more expensive ?
and back up to five stars .
so we proved our ages and entered .
and that ' s not a bad thing .
worst i ' ve had anywhere in a while .
perhaps she was too mellow for even mellow mushroom .
i will someday try out the <UNK> course .
"nice work , <UNK> ."
we ordered an appetizer and two mains .
see the photo above - rrb - .
great to be able to get slices in charlotte .
this is a technical issue .
you know what they say about bad pizza ... .
this was also my first visit to pisces .
"overall , i thought it was a great lunch ."
not a big deal .
i ' ll be back for sure .
that brought the total down to around $ 000 .
my gut told me to get a second opinion .
"about $ 000 later , the car drives great ."
"big , big relief to find this place finally ."
that place was a wreck .
or so everyone said .
chalk it up to monkey house syndrome .
the down sides are really the same as before .
here are a few : 0 .
the indoor seating on the upper floor is ingenious .
two registers near the central / the plaza intersection .
"and best of all , their prices are right ."
the had a bunch of particularly bad <UNK> .
"the sliders , in particular , were fantastic ."
"great , airy interior as well ."
"finally found this place , and none too soon ."
"king is a busy , dirty place ."
so check this place out .
their cheese selection is awesome .
that place is incredible .
the 0/0 chicken dinner is a meal for two .
the hushpuppies are maybe a bit bland .
but the chicken is the star here .
that was not long after the restaurant opened .
never used the drive through .
long live the northern donut war of <UNK> .
what ' s not to like ?
let me cut to the chase .
the barbecue here is really really good .
"so , a + on the bbq ."
"also , the staff were all really great ."
now the down side ... price .
go to your local bike shop for better service .
that row of taps is something to behold .
and wednesday night trivia is always fun .
common house provides great bang for the buck .
i ' m glad the place is doing well .
the food was not bad at all .
<UNK> is basically a sports bar .
mattie ' s is itself a great addition .
their spicy <UNK> dosa was excellent as well .
"not big on ambiance , but the food rocks ."
it ' s just really good and tasty .
where did they find that thing ?
on the death star ?
nice job on that .
not impressive at all .
the crepes are very tasty as well .
it comes rare by default .
the first beer i wanted they were out of .
her crepe was nicely done .
the waterfall and pond in back are astounding .
everybody ought to try this place out .
i ' m looking forward to many future visits .
the bbq was outstanding .
yeah i said it .
kool whip was involved .
i ' ll be back every chance i get .
this is a great independent coffee shop .
you ' ll enjoy your evening .
i liked it but was n't blown away .
"very , very tasty stuff ."
that ' ll take your meal over the top .
far from the worst .
mine could have used a bit more sauce .
remember that appointments are a must for service issues .
but the store is always a mob scene .
the <UNK> offerings are nearly endless .
"you can get breakfast any time , as well ."
nice work by these guys .
but some places manage to cook them right .
i have eaten <UNK> of pizzas .
"maybe more , i lost count ."
brixx does a fine job of the thin crust .
both were pretty tasty .
ditto for the edge of the crust .
"still tasty enough , but not quite there ."
the food stands out as well .
the facility is top notch .
i know my wife feels the same .
they also need to focus on keeping it clean .
"so , on the balance dolce is a-ok ."
pretty decent pizza at this place .
but you know what they say about pizza .
not much to add about this place .
it was quite a dish .
the coffee was quite good as well .
"altogether an impressive brunch , really quite excellent ."
"c'est la vie , right ?"
"the black cod was superb , just fantastic ."
le ' s does it right .
"the sandwiches were both great , no complaints ."
"also , it ' s not a bargain ."
the shrimp and grits was the clear stand out .
at least it ' s interesting .
the service was prompt and friendly .
the plain cheese was probably the best .
lots of chicken packed inside that thing .
"go , and you wo n't be disappointed ."
everyone knows what a costco is .
costco kirkland medium roast whole coffee beans .
kirkland <UNK> free dress shirts .
traditional or button down collar .
they have these back by the butcher section .
need a huge wedge of pecorino romano ?
looks like i have to go to costco .
a nice little complimentary <UNK> on a good meal .
two things did stand out : 0 .
this was a really interesting dish .
rei stores are remarkably consistent .
the largest enclosure is for the eagles .
what a great find .
real solid mexican food waaay down south blvd . .
well this was a fine surprise .
maybe that ' s true .
trader joe ' s is a little bit <UNK> .
hence the <UNK> review .
five star aspects : great house brand yogurts .
good price on <UNK> eggs .
great prices on some decent cheeses .
stick with duke ' s and <UNK> ' s .
the restaurant ' s interior was quite nice .
not by a long shot .
"first , the service was awesome ."
"- rrb - , and it was quite good ."
that ' s what my rating reflects .
it ' s just an honest diner .
really the main disappointment was the ramen .
nothing about it was particularly good .
that ' s about right .
the standouts were the honey almond and grasshopper varieties .
i put it in caps for a reason .
that is a dish worth traveling for .
will continue to be a regular customer .
. give them a chance .
have been to numerous bbq restaurants in the valley .
this place is a real joke ... .
after a short argument we walked out .
"bad service , bad attitudes of the mgmt ."
make for no return trip .
my advise is to stay away from mama <UNK> .
i had a specialty pie request .
better than some of the other local pizza restaurants .
thank you ray ' s .
please do your research .
can you say ` ` smoked out ' ' .
go <UNK> ` chu some .
ate there awhile back and will not be back .
and the owner is a real jerk .
no wonder the scottsdale and <UNK> stores closed .
the food is exact opposite of chicago food .
"please reply , anybody !"
"terrible service , long lines , broken kiosks ."
nope ... incompetence reigns supreme .
sheesh ... ok i ' m done complaining now .
went for a romantic dinner with my wife .
"in fact , i recommend everything they have ."
just left the <UNK> nook in de forest .
"both excellent , good portions and kind service !"
a welcome addition to the east liberty dining corridor .
excellent nan and curry <UNK> .
on my second visit i forgot my reusable bag .
"ironically , your store offers recycling of <UNK> bags ."
i have seen your cashiers double bag many items .
ensure that sprouts sincerely <UNK> the appearance sprouts sells .
the food is great .
she is first rate on my book .
. she knows how to treat the customers .
he lacks customer service .
no acknowledgement that they are hh member .
this is the best pizza chain in arizona !
dr . judge is great .
the most important note ?
a great experience at dish .
overall a great experience at mac ' s .
overall it was a 0 star experience .
- rrb - with a tremendous beer selection .
hotel is a bit dated .
staff seem to be very friendly .
several sauces to choose from .
very tender and full of flavor .
never had any issues with customer service .
driver ' s last name was chen .
this place has really begun to slip in quality .
the quality of the meat has really dropped .
lunch portions are even huge .
parking for the showroom is atrocious if busy .
"great place , and i recommend them to everyone ."
cupcake atm is the greatest invention ever .
would recommend to anyone near the linq .
"great food , company , and service ."
need to get big ten network though .
also calls to verify appointment 00 hours in advance .
steve did a great job in very little time .
i would recommend dent guys to anyone .
honest and up front .
lunch buffet is great .
you can take in the whole show better .
good surprise taste after the next .
"it came out so tender , like braised beef ."
and the flavor was very similar to braised beef .
and wifey is a big poutine fan .
not sure what goes into making this .
but the service was excellent & accommodating .
my wife liked it much more than i did .
"she loves buffets , especially in vegas ."
"in our opinion , bacchanal is better ."
so you ca n't go wrong with either .
and the food tastes great .
no other place like this in the world !
the servers are dressed like farm hands .
it ' s chinese meets <UNK> ... .
you can also stop by and eat @user <UNK> .
the name i ca n't remember .
i ' m sure the food is good .
they did a terrific job .
i actually enjoy the food at this place .
some decent appetizers but over priced for quality .
this place has gone down hill in a hurry .
i was embarrassed to take my girlfriend here .
best organic restaurant in arizona .
good value for quality and a nice atmosphere .
i would n't recommend this place to anyone .
not at all good hotel experience .
would not recommend this property at all .
"nice , cool place to hangout ."

the decor matched the service - excellent .

the <UNK> was amazing and very well put together .
some other ranges charge by the hour .

it was a blast .
the waiter was friendly and the place was quiet .

"not awful , but not worth a return trip ."
the atmosphere is cool .

this time around i opted for the ribeye .
it was a prime ribeye .
the steak was perfect .
"wow , great crawfish ."
"they have good shrimp , too ."

service was good but food left us wanting .
no real taste and most was overlooked .

authentic cheap fresh street style tacos !
"all in all , this place is fine ."
apparently this place has been around for 00 years .
do you really need my review to convince you ?
this is n't a bad place at all .
we got an awesome appetizer of seared ahi tuna .
i went with a steak and lobster .
finally they substituted unseasoned sliced turkey on the burger .
coconut shrimp and ahi tuna appetizers were prepared flawlessly .
let me clarify - i ate here at 0am .
the pizza itself was very good .
the downside of this place ?
each slice was close to $ 0 .
"but , they have an amazing steak deal ."
all of that can be yours .
this was the most flavorful dish of the night .
lago needs some time to develop .
what a joke right ?
who was working and who were the paid customers ?
the spaghetti noodles are cooked to an al dente .
the service was subpar .

probably the most valuable place in vegas .

my buddy had the tacos and practically inhaled them .
the taco - the basics of mexican .
i ' m not making this up folks .
"sloppily dressed , shirt hanging out over his gut ."
what is sad is that this place has potential .
they tie it back away from the food .
you guys are all over the place .

thank god for our new wireless community program .
i have to ` earn ' better seats ?

i was talking to an idiot .
"so far , excellent results ."

am i in a giant garage ?
where green surpasses other restaurants is flavor .
the hash browns were under cooked .
i hope you see where this is going .
going on my best of tempe list .
but maybe i should try the phoenix location first .
another seven minutes later i was done .
all the employees are very competent .
i opted out of getting the gloves .

"<UNK> , and washes , and valley fever ."
"<UNK> , and <UNK> , and sun devils ."
there ' s a state gun ?
great restaurant and a nice area of scottsdale .
the staff is polite .
the food came about two minutes later .
the first thing you notice is the great service .
"after ordering , the staff brings you your order ."
"you sat next to the salsa bar , right ?"
the churro is the real bonus .
some sweet treats <UNK> customers from the counter .
off to the left is the seating area .
who just relies on signs and flashy colors ?
"so i added them , thanks yelp ."
that was n't my fault people .
"i got the reuben cheesesteak , which was good ."
"great , easy trail for the whole family ."
there always seems to be a sale going on .
i assume it is good as well .
inside the corner spot is an actual thai restaurant .
my wife and i have been twice .
nothing stands out from our second visit .
it is a very handy niche to fill .
checkout is self checkout .
assistance is provided if necessary .
i will always have fond memories of the seed .
"enter mellow mushroom , stage left ."
"- lrb - well , trendy for tempe ."
having good bear helps as well .
one of our <UNK> of <UNK> ... gone .

"<UNK> , you ' re missing out ."

my cart does n't roll straight .
"there are no baskets , just carts ."

more seniors than a senior center .
"all <UNK> , code 00 ."
' ' it ' s walmart .
profits measured one penny at a time .
self-checkout with a weight sensor to keep you honest .

cooking the food helps a lot .

the beef was great .

can i get my haircut here ?
the knot gene is a life saver .
have you ever wanted to try real ramen ?
"naturally , i ordered <UNK> with my ramen ."

it is easy to make a bland club sandwich .
the bacon completed the sandwich .

i highly recommend the barrio pollo y chorizo .
"then , silk road ."
i enjoy seeing the belly dancing numbers at <UNK> .
we were well attended during our visit .
"otherwise , there were some mediocre racing games ."
i conducted a thorough search of the premises .
and the pizza is pizza .
too bad they do n't yelp .
my wife loves the vegetarian combination .
another opportunity to have a great meal .
there seems to be three types of pizza .
indoor and outdoor tables are available .
the dinner menu also boasts a myriad of options .
me : what else do you like ?
<UNK> : the food .
she tried her hand at volleyball .
the personal pizza was n't enough for my daughter .
outstanding acrobatics and strength and grace are amazing .
good filtration <UNK> smoke quickly .
staff were very helpful and courteous .
also the extreme <UNK> of slots in general .
the latest and greatest is also the most expensive .
trendy without being stuffy .
request robert if he ' s available .
he followed up with drawings and several budget options .
check it out - you wo n't be disappointed .
this one is just a little bit better .
"just eggs , sausage , toast , cereal ."
"very tender , nice breading ."
<UNK> appetizer is a must .
"very , very good , especially the stew ."
not a five star hotel .
management needs to work on customer satisfaction .
everything costs extra money here .
poor resolution of issues .
my girlfriend and i recently moved across town .
"most dishes $ 0.00 , some include jasmine rice ."
"pad see ew just ok , flavors not complex ."
a manager took my finished beet salad plate away .
scallops a little gritty but food quality excellent .
beet salad excellent as well .
ben here at least a dozen times .
food generally very good .
this dish not recommended .
the other half was chinese .
the food was pretty good .
would n't be disappointed going back there though .
you got ta share dishes to enjoy it .
the food is a bit bland in general though .
the location / decor was a bit disappointing .
i drove by and laughed at the restaraunt name .
i would recommend to anyone .
sorry only description i could think of .
others who gave bad reviews should ask for him .
i see why this place has all the stars .
this is one of them .
they were very large and tasted great .
probably the best i ever had .
our server ` ` <UNK> ' ' was excellent .
- rrb - pizza with traditional wings .
both were very good .
". whoa , this is an airport ?"
plus they ' ve implemented full body <UNK> here .
automatic star loss right there .
now for all the down sides .
not quite a hand wash but comparable .
the best part ... the vacuums are free .
my wife and i recently moved to las vegas .
<UNK> ' s is a great irish pub .
my personal favorite are the chicken <UNK> blue appetizers .
keep up the great work guys !
ok hands down best coffee place around .
what gave it 0 stars is the service .
a kid at taco bell is friendlier .
a little customer service goes a long way .
"i actually got sick , which i never do ."
"sorry folks , but not going there again ."
james and his crew are on top their game .
james and his crew are on top their game .
he has always responded quickly and with sound advice .
you wo n't be disappointed .
every seat is good in this small venue .
warning : the jokes are vulgar .
i recommend the enchiladas del mar . .
great service from very knowledgeable staff .
then you ' ll ask for an explanation .
none of what ate was below standard .
quality crowd and staff .
"good food , good prices ."
worst hot dog ever .
0 eleven hot fog is better .
"if you must eat there , burger is ok ."
"always good lunch , excellent soup ... gooood sushi ."
the reason for the missing star is restroom .
i had to reduce my previous 0 star rating .
"today , the <UNK> sucked ."
either the owners or the cook changed .
there is no other explanation .
"asked med steak , got well done ."
"overall , didnt meet expectation ."
i would still reccomend you give it a try .
food quality never changed .
"but no , cold burger , terrible fries ."
"for this price and location , i expected better ."
very nice and pro service .
there are better options .
owner contacted for my review .
give them a shot .
this is my second visit to <UNK> .
our entire visit was very good .
you can tell from the lines on the cuts .
unprofessional mgr and server .
a place to try for all thai lovers .
"for the price , food is 0 star ."
"' ' answer , ` ` no ' ' ."
average burger n fries .
"service people have good intentions , no <UNK> ."
didnt wan na argue over the bill .
am i wrong here ?
"extensive , quality menu ."
<UNK> ` ` 0 ' ' .
<UNK> taste in chicken .
"ok tasting fries , overpriced overall due to location ."
average tasting soda <UNK> beef used to be excellent .
we did n't give bad grade the first time .
<UNK> upgrade your cooks and menu .
"<UNK> chips , squid , tuna don and more ."
all was good except burger which was average .
"additionally , the food taste great ."
the price is fair .
"thanks guys , you ' ve earned my trust ."
<UNK> service was poor at best .
the waitress spoke no english - zero .
i ' m a fan of the food .
and is just a pleasure to see .
i tried to just deal with it .
what a chicken i was .
he had a couple corny jokes but they helped .
more importantly my precious granddaughter loves it .
prices way too high .
no more chicken up grade available .
also getting a nice buzz is a plus too .
filet i decided to send it back .
joe and mario would not be pleased .
this place is legit .
hope this restaurant succeeds and stays around .
this is the quintessential mom and pop shop .
special occasion for a milestone anniversary .
got the yelp coupon and was in the area .
"but surprisingly , even the wife liked it ."
0 block away is pho saigon near greenland .
had to ask for glass of water 0 times .
got the 0 - person fajitas .
"again , this is a 0 person share ."
what are these people thinking ?
big judgement error guys .
"save a penny , lost a local customer ."
cod lettuce wrap was good .
"nice setting , great service , reasonable prices ."
great value and quite satisfying .
"nice setting , not stuffy or intimidating ."
"great service , and outstanding food ."
everything about this place seemed a little shady .
advertised 00 hrs but not .
advertisement and pizza box specifically says 00hrs .
cook says those are old .
order goes to call center apparently .
i had the pork ribs and beef garlic pepper .
"flavorful , complex sauces ."
i asked for a bone-in fillet .
i got a bone-in rib eye .
the ahi tartare was decent .
do n't go here for the ambiance though .
good food at reasonable price .
both less than $ 0 .
black cod and hamachi shooters were also good .
keep it real with your reviews people .
enjoyable but not too impressed .
"needed more depth , seasoning and heat ."
overall decent but not overly impressed .
"ribeye and steak salad were ok , nothing special ."
buff sauce was way salty and overpowering .
but they are not shy about loading it on .
the theatre itself seems fairly new and nice inside .
the picture was clear and the sound was good .
where ' s the boss of this place ?
i went here sunday morning with my girlfriend .
this place was jam packed with tables .
the food came out fast but was nothing special .
i pushed it aside and tried the pancakes .
hash browns are just hash browns .
bagels and everything on their menu is top notch .
i recommend the bbq pork sandwich and fried zucchini .
"large portions , and a very tentative staff ."
price is a tad high though .
and that is my sole complaint .
hash browns not crispy enough .
bacon thick and good .
"bear pictures , bear statues , bear memorabilia everywhere !"
what can go wrong ?
well that ' s prolly too harsh .
it did n't taste bad or anything .
the hash browns here are not crisp at all .
none of that <UNK> crap or that <UNK> <UNK> .
this burger is just bursting with awesome juicy flavor .
there is nothing more to say .
and modern science can prove that .
postino is a necessary part of the human experience .
but dude was i surprised !
the selection was pretty standard fare .
was very impressed with the squid pasta .
had to spit a good majority of them out .
it feels like such a wasted opportunity .
the food itself however was pretty <UNK> .
so why 0 stars if the food is good ?
a small plate of food will average $ 0-0 .
and that ' s what brings this place down .
but the portions are all out of whack .
but this appetizer dish was just so <UNK> horrible .
"shame on you , margaritaville ."
so there was some considerable hype going into this .
this is where the cupcake falls short of excellence .
but enough about manny .
the food was blandness itself .
this flaw is a fatal one .
freshly baked and packed with flavor .
steak was actually pretty good .
a giant ol ' ribeye .
but there ' s no denying its deliciousness .
the mashed potatoes were decent .
a good starchy contrast to the steak .
especially the wall of bottled spirits .
"an excellent appetizer , i must say ."
next was the entree .
"ca n't go wrong with that , yeah ?"
and the only true <UNK> to both is <UNK> .
this place is the real deal .
the ingredients on it were a mixed bag .
steak was n't cooked the way i asked .
"wonderful <UNK> , as expected of a vegas restaurant ."
well what ' s to say ?
so props to these guys for pulling it off !
my review is negative because it reflects the food .
big flaw with the dish was the sriracha aioli .
completely brought the appetizer dish down .
"good in concept , horrid in execution ."
"also , noted <UNK> of sauce ."
taste did not meet expectations .
pork ramen - mediocre at best .
"noodles were extremely good , very creamy and filling ."
good asian food in phoenix is difficult to find .
their coffees are pretty good .
what ' s not to like ?
<UNK> the dreaded 0 star review .
0 stars says it all .
"good , but not great , nothing special ."
"but other than that , you know ."
you ca n't screw it up .
came here for dinner with a bachelor party .
surprisingly moist and soggy rather than crisp .
everything about the dish was very well done .
the hash browns are worth raving about though .
even the toast was fantastic .
the jam was made with fresh berries .
went great with the freshly made jam .
all-in-all it was a good breakfast experience .
it was n't the best breakfast in the world .
dad and sister came down for a surprise visit .
"uh oh , totally unprepared ."
service was very slow though .
top it off with chipotle sauce .
ordered the three sauce fajita burrito .
the raw chocolate sauce was the real star .
i got to try a few dishes : 0 .
the sides were pretty good .
this is just the place .
* the service is ridiculously slow .
evidently no manager managing anything .
get it together folks .
this place sucks major d * * * .
just stopped by during a conference .
my ribeye steak was well-seasoned and cooked perfectly .
better than lucille ' s in california .
the steak was juicy and well-seasoned .
just a notch above carl ' s jr . .
the coors light was a little flat .
"overall , just an average sports bar ."
the crowd here seemed a little older .
pizza is better than average .
"cool concept , bad execution ."
what more can you ask for ?
the food is good but its overpriced .
... i ' ll pass .
did you say this place is all-you-can-eat ?
this time ... big mistake .
they only got the high quality shit here .
the seafood was actually better than the steak .
avoid gray line at all costs .
waited 00 min for a shuttle to show up .
luggage took over an hour to show up .
the sabor burrito is excellent .
"this place is the bomb , !"
the food here is awesome .
had excellent flavor and spices .
this place is amazing .
"all staffs are good , helpful and knowledgable ."
this place is highly recommended .
the dude with glasses was awesome as fuck !
gravy is good as fuck .
the food was very good .
the drinks were very good .
i guess i am not hip enough .
did not expect this .
can you say false <UNK> .
sunshine and the guys there are awesome .
beer on sale every week .
what more could you want .
i had lunch there today .
it ' s a carnivorous delight .
"also , no espresso drinks are available ."
maggie ' s thrift supports maggie ' s place .
there are many more tasty alcoholic offerings .
"the pho is avg , but hits the spot ."
stopped here on a drive to vegas from reno .
the food here is very good .
really great breakfast place near fremont street .
"awesome ingredients , great presentation and delicious flavors ."
super positive energy here too .
not cheap but worth it .
see you in the flowers .
this place is the real deal .
on demand never seems to work .
support people are clueless .
i recently visited this restaurant on a business trip .
staff was very friendly and the line moved quickly .
try it ... you wo n't be disappointed .
the new york cut is amazing .
a revisit for sure .
the first real knock against tamari was the service .
the food was pretty good .
go here once to say you did .
it will be pretty huge .
i ' ll update my review then .
"excellent service , food , atmosphere , etc . ."
<UNK> made the experience that much more enjoyable .
she made the good food great .
get her if she ' s available .
ordered a sandwich and played a few games .
the sandwich was most excellent as was the pinball .
ive been here 0-0 times .
what do you really expect ?
rude as hell and pure crap pizza .
this location sucks ass .
whoa what a shit whole .
management is worse then the food .
staff is friendly and portions are huge .
fish sandwich was excellent .
onion rings also excellent .
i highly recommend ada ' s .
prices very reasonable as well .
these guys took care of us as promised .
burger was on par .
"nothing bad to say about them , simply noting ."
not a good look .
"loooong story short , waste of time and money !"
its a good open course race .
"it used to be fantastic , but not anymore ."
i have not had a bad meal here .
their red chili could be the best in town .
my wife and i really enjoyed this place .
i had the godfather pizza and it was great .
this place deserves a 0th star !
some of their beers are limited .
i also recommend using the <UNK> app .
"maybe less , i ' m not kidding ."
most people wo n't .
i am basing this review on 0 visit .
the service was pretty good .
my wife ordered the carne asada burrito .
now the food was fantastic .
both times the burgers were cooked to perfection .
the wings are pretty good too .
+ - lrb - pos - rrb - .
"awesome food , authentically persian , awesome service ."
everything is extremely fresh .
then you get into management .
messages dont get to the managers per office workers .
management has no fucking clue .
came home to someone parked in my space .
hope management reviews this but i bet not .
i am glad i found them .
more naan should be made available at the buffet .
no salt \ pepper on the table .
these donuts are legit .
probably the best i ' ve ever had .
"small , old-school set-up with a drive-thru ."
the seats were <UNK> and worn .
` ` loading something awesome ' ' ?
nope : ` ` loading something awful .
none of us came away unsatisfied .
the food here is prepared and served quickly .
"i call this place a fast , casual restaurant ."
will be coming back again soon .
this place is horrible at night .
spoke to the owner once .
i miss this place .
go here and you will be happy you did .
valentines day is supposed to be a pleasent memory .
"this one was not , courtesy of luke <UNK> ."
bisque had an overpowering sherry taste to it .
almost drowning any other flavor profile .
` baseball cut ' filet mignon .
stopped in while in lv with a few friends .
it is 0 star worthy .
ridiculously good bbq and deserves the praise it gets .
everyone here at archery hq has been amazing .
they have the best pre-packaged juices in town .
these guys are great .
they are very friendly and know their stuff .
ordered a # 0 .
it was nothing special .
and what is that instinct you might ask ?
girlfriend had the grilled turkey .
stopped by today while on business .
service was above average and food was very good .
try the beef salad ; fresh and very good .
the breakfast was absolutely off the hook .
stopped here after a spring training game and wow !
<UNK> used to have value .
this is an awful company .
morrison vein is extremely expensive .
then you may be ready for surface vein removal .
the waiter was holding the bowl in the air .
what happened to the customer ' s always right ?
the bakery is outstanding .
the staff works hard .
the tastes and textures were perfect !
her soups are fantastic .
"not many places , guaranteed ."
very refreshing on an arizona summer day .
today i had the wild alaskan smoked salmon special .
only to be topped by a chocolate cherry turnover .
what an amazing combination of flavors .
this is local business at it ' s best .
service was attentive and made good food recommendations .
this is a legit korean bbq spot in vegas !
"meat was fresh , and very tasty ."
its kind of small for a vegas night club .
they make some <UNK> ramen here for happy hour .
this is some quality steak and seafood !
"only average tasting , at best ."
overall not a bad place to grub at .
would recommend if you like this kind of <UNK> .
i always like to support private and family businesses .
so my wife and i tired it .
ordered a brisket sandwich .
the beef was so dry it was inedible .
great <UNK> and comfortable environment .
just a bunch of kids last saturday at 0pm .
decent 0 bed apt for a good price .
the place is just ghetto .
"but here , its actually true ."
"excellent value , they do n't rip you off ."
it helps that they have a lot of locations .
this place is great .
exactly what i expect out of a pub .
omg this architecture is incredible .
is that real live actual <UNK> ?
anyone who knows me knows i <UNK> the heat .
that will not be your experience here !
awesome environment and atmosphere .
she did not give me the proper change .
the service while friendly is very disorganized .
"tender , seasoned and grilled perfectly ."
always cooked to order .
the decor and ambience are the only downsides .
"however , the food quality if worth the wait ."
"for starters , it was ugly as sin ."
what kind of bullshit is that ?
the overall rating here is not accurate .
"making it ballpark with caesars , etc . ."
it ' s a completely legit .
"no personnel to help , possibly on entire floor ."
my room was 00th floor on the pyramid .
great server and staff .
better than expected for a vegas strip cafe .
drinks are really good the bartender knows his stuff .
well worth the extra mileage .
the service here has always been great .
every roll was made to perfection .
i finished all of them .
the specialty rolls were massive and delicious .
wow - this is amazing stuff .
a wise decision indeed .
sushi was also very pedestrian .
"would not recommend , will not go back ."
"cmon , what a ripoff !"
they all have poor attitude when talking to customers .
the service was extraordinary .
amazing texture and flavor .
for the main dish my wife ordered another agnolotti .
this dish is nothing short of brilliant .
it was the kobe rib cap .
my wife and i are foodies .
outstanding wagyu strawberry dish .
"tasty quesadillas , tortas , omelettes , and horchata ."
felt very much like it should be in seattle .
"decent place , feels very <UNK> ."
quite an eclectic guy that aw .
no beer with lunch though - lrb - bogus !
funny <UNK> fans ala philly .
very nice cheap quick bus service to airport .
chris is an excellent real estate agent and advisor .
got the mexican flavor burger .
"was great , but all ingredients seemed store bought ."
"other than that , another good burger ."
sometimes what happens in vegas stays in vegas .
the strip basically <UNK> the <UNK> of vegas .
the rooms are cheap .
"very , very large patio , by the way ."
drinks are also very expensive here .
. really miss the flavors of these dishes .
i am <UNK> a review on <UNK> <UNK> .
would go back just for her ability .
damn you earl and your sandwiches !
it was cooked just the way i <UNK> it .
i was in steak nirvana .
to me buffets are all quantity over quality .
i ' ve never had a bad meal here .
"try the <UNK> , <UNK> ' re fantastic !"
my suggestion pass on this place .
they were crunchy but had no character .
while the patties were <UNK> they were not frozen .
"food is great , inexpensive as well ."
a + pretty solid chinese .
save the money and go to planet hollywood .
expected a little more from mirage .
guest service needs some serious improvement .
the steak was very good as well .
it seems the place is understaffed .
a few shakes was not enough .
i think they forgot to add any salt .
. thanks a million brian s .

their internet reliability is a joke .

bit pricey but so be it very happy experience .
i waited nearly 00 minutes to speak to someone .
pho here is expensive @user $ 0 / bowl .
compared to pho thanh @user $ 0-0 per bowl .
. no one showed .
cramped is never a good thing .
perhaps never again at all .
the first visit was great .
this is where the bad begins .
"the third visit on , things get really bad ."
the fourth and fifth visits just sucked .
"so long , <UNK> ."
"pretty , pretty good ."
"well , this place was that bad ."
"come on guys , way too early for that ."
"so yeah , i do n't recommend this place ."
this is a fantastic radio station .
this place is amazing italian !
waste of time and cab ride .
the staff was very engaging and up beat .
do yourself a favor and never come here .
very very courteous guy .
absolute best car buying experience !
this place is out of control .
when i complained they could care less .
not worth the drive or the expense .
do not use these guys .
return trip charges even when they caused the return .
the best pizza in arizona period .
not well known but should be .
one of the nicest humans and pizza a maker .
please try this guys pizza .
this place was below average .
i had the spicy yin nan rice noodle .
"great portions , good food ."

overpriced for the quality and quantity .
it simply does not live up to vegas standards .
good italian food at reasonable prices .
biz partner and i went there today for lunch .
"i ordered a burger , medium ."
it came well done and was very bland .
the fries ... what can i say but wow .
biz partner ' s were just as bad .
"pancakes and sausage were good , too ."
the place still looks new and is very clean .
"prices seemed reasonable , too ."
been here a few times now for lunch .
the place has a very modern feel to it .
you will not be disappointed .
the whole italian mediterranean fusion was a bad idea .
"i liked the aesthetics , but service was poor ."
the food reflected the poor service .

the concept and atmosphere are great .
line a mile long as you might expect .
our favorite place for coffee - anywhere .

"this is , indeed , cafeteria food ."
"it was good , but short lived ."
ca n't beat this deal .

phoenix is lucky to have this place .
the owners seem very nice .
the interior is cool and they keep it ethnic .
there spicy / hotness is actually <UNK> .
writing about papa john ' s is pretty lame .
if you ask me he ' s succeeded .
* <UNK> is street for crack rock .
the food is acceptable .
they have a descent lunch special as well .
first friday gives me hope for vegas .
there ' s always some kind of band playing .
what i like is the demographic .
this is real deal vegas .
the young black driver was speeding from the start .
artichoke hummus was off the chain .
the worst chips and salsa in town .
his techniques are <UNK> and unique .
you have to experience it to feel it .
this restaurant is run by a bunch morons .
no . 0 is missing for the entire night .
both dining in and drive through .
"the deco is great , upscale looking ."
"well , this place is great ."
we found out they serve great steaks .
all well prepared and tasty .
the owner tries very hard to please customers .
but execution is just not quite there .
today was a total disappointment .
always a favorite place at downtown scottsdale .
00 minutes went by ... then 00 .
"of course , they refuse to accept returned software ."
best sandwich in my opinion is the <UNK> billy .
the thai food here is beyond good .
he showed up and was great and fair .
really liked the lamb skewers .
shrimp tempura was large but just ok on taste .
reasonably good food and lots of it .
"food was ok , service was excellent ."
ask for it from the kitchen .
a place like treasure island or mgm would do .
the sandwich is pretty good .
i wo n't be returning again .
it ' s onto minute 00 .
"unsurprisingly , they ' re probably high ."
"now , for the food ."

a great neighborhood place .
i will take this over chinese any day .
this restaurant looks it has been close for weeks .

"as always , great food ."
note - i did not eat here .
"it was excellent , as expected ."
"if your in town , you must go here ."
"overcharge on fountain drink , paid about $ 00.00 ."
but overall there burgers are good !
worth a visit for sure .
i was here at the appointed time .
"drinks were adequate , food was uninspired ."
then go somewhere else for supper .
wait staff was attentive and nice .
many <UNK> were broken down .
the train sucks too .
* feels | typical vegas feel .
overall : 0 stars .
then that should change my rating .
the wait was fairly respectable and worth it .
highly recommended if you are in the phoenix area !
you will not be disappointed .
the ketchup is made in house = awesome .
ill be visiting again no doubt !
first review but not the first time here .
a point i will explore soon .
but with different sides .
best of luck to you guys .
hostess had a side pony .
pizza : fair price for its size .
the cheese may have been overcooked ?
the bottle and draft selection is always exciting .
the layout of this place is very comfortable .
bad impression left for sure .
- never been but will now frequent .
food and service were excellent .
the wipers work fine .
they finished the oil change .
this is where things get good .
do not have your oil changed here !
the meat was terrible .
the 0 cans of <UNK> were 0 bucks each .
excellent service with a classy atmosphere .
by far the best bar in the area .
new location same good food .
bread : sparse but some of the best around .
baked potato : large and good .
a bit dry without any drizzle or au jus .
i prefer ` ` hobby ' ' .
every single one of them ?
a five spot with home fries .
"our waiter was informed , helpful , and attentive ."
the value proposition component really sticks with me here .
more than enough food .
"everything is bland , overcooked , and ridiculously priced ."
this is your second mistake .
"sadly , the bistro calls you on your bullshit ."
this was n't a horrible dining experience .
probably closer to a 0.0 star .
extremely tasty <UNK> or whatever they call it .
you wo n't be disappointed .
"pig & pickle is extremely , extremely good ."
the staff at petite maison is absolutely fantastic .
the wings are serious <UNK> .
great neighborhood pizza joint .

do yourself a favor and duck into coronado instead .
we rounded things out with the chocolate-covered bacon s'mores .
wow this pizza is fantastic .
look no further than gordon biersch !
smashburger provides absolutely fantastic tasting burgers .
definitely a good place .
coal burger is a good solid burger .

"it ' s a solid , quality burger ."
<UNK> has a great mesquite whisper to it .
middle of the road burger .
"decent enough , but nothing special ."
the fries are decidedly <UNK> .
"more than that , it was simply not good ."
the meat was devoid of flavor and overcooked .
"meaty , delicious , tender , fresh business ."
"overall , a good place to eat ."
chick ' s not quite there yet .
"for one , things are a bit expensive ."
my girlfriend got the pot pie .
the chicken just lacked <UNK> for me .
the cake is flavorful and tastes pure and clean .
in n out 0 .
fatburger and <UNK> and smashburger are awfully close .
"finally , the price is obnoxious ."
turn that shit down .
jimmy john ' s is an interesting place .
jimmy john ' s sandwiches are thoroughly mediocre .
so i ' ll keep going .
the specials are particularly diverse and change daily .
- lrb - we get a weekly sacks delivery .
"fortunately , it did here ."
the tapas were pretty well executed .
they were incredibly good .
very good attention to detail with something like that .
- rrb - this is some fantastic pizza .
everything going on with the pizza is just fantastic .
the appetizers are great too .
it wo n't be a problem .
<UNK> needs a bit of work .
paradise carpet cleaning is basically a guy named george .
this is to your advantage .
george keeps things simple .
the food is just barely passable .
quite fantastic food with decent service .

it is the best i have ever had .
the food is pretty good .
it was loud and pretty awful .

they ' ll blow you away as an encore .
i understand the hype .
and do n't forget to ask about <UNK> dick .
matt ' s was absolutely fantastic .
perfect for dipping both waffle and bacon alike .
will be coming back .
i want to call this a 0.0 .
does what it says on the tin .
the mac and cheese was quite good .
- rrb - this review references just the steakhouse .
time your steaks right .
it was absolutely brilliant .
"perfectly done , perfectly flavored , delicious ."
durant ' s knows how to steak .
chompie ' s has a ton going for it .
their mile high sandwiches are absurd .
"otherwise , it was damn good ."
do yourself a favor and swing on by .
scratch is an <UNK> experience .
"and recently , they ' ve started serving dinner ."
"charming story aside , the food is absolutely amazing ."
- lrb - lovingly donated by the <UNK> brothers .
"overall , a decent meal ."
the highlight is almost certainly their incredibly onion rings .
- rrb - bliss is really really really good .
. you can easily get jacked here .
i highly recommend to anyone .
service blows and food is just okay .
crazy ass long lines and three people working .
so do n't use avis in phx .
i was out in vegas last week for work .
my waiter was awesome .
he walked me through all of the oysters available .
great service and outstanding food .
this place truly rocks .
you have to give these guys a try .
this place totally rocked .
huge portion of taste that no mortal could finish .
there ' s nothing wrong with this place .
the salsa bar itself is good .
the food itself is good quality .
sadly neither was worth the 0 buck price .
i was in phoenix for a week for work .
and i needed me some wings and cold beer .
and it all went with the beer sooooo well .
- rrb - just got through brewing it up .
it went perfectly with the wings .
the tortilla equivalent of the best kettle chips .
- rrb - and do n't fall apart <UNK> .
the bagged salads are better priced than most places .
closed unfortunately the economy has claimed another victim .
the <UNK> ' s carne asada was better .
add two dollars to the price of everything .
carne asada is tasty .
fish burrito is <UNK> .
california burrito is really good .
their ability to roll a proper burrito is non-existent .
the negatives : a lot of dirt .
the grass has a hard time with constant traffic .
excellent on all levels .
prices are reasonable and a good value .
the seafood banh <UNK> is day bomb .
great service and fair prices every time !
the yellowfin was outstanding !

food was below average in flavor .
overall the experience was positive .
decent value and kind service .
"great service , excellent detail job and good value ."

nothing really to complain about .
the rooms are also not well appointed .
my wife and i really enjoyed this place .
the food was very good .
the atmosphere is really unique .
"no microbrews , but still some unique beers ."
they add some sort of breading on them now .
staff was very friendly .
i dropped it off three weeks ago .
john does n't seem to know .
he calls the service tech .
then john starts to take the computer apart .
i took my stuff and left .
the small class sizes were also very nice .
this place is legit .
beans are good and authentic .
service is very good .
the wall taco shop .
sitting in firebirds as i write this .
"a slightly older crowd , drinks are good ."
true authentic italian deli .
it should have been correct the first time .
"this place is janky and dirty , at best ."
"construction is for new york ny , not mc ."
no wifi in rooms in 0000 .
now for the bad : service could be better .
the decor could use an update .
it was like one serving spoon ' s worth .
i like many hipster eateries .
these guys are awesome .
this is where phoenix body works gets things right .
really pretty poor value for $ 0.00 .
nice place and atmosphere .
i had the ribeye .
my wife had the filet .
excellent chips and salsa with a variety of options .
this local pub in morningside is simply fantastic .
the food is fantastic .
the smokehouse barbecue chicken sandwich was also fantastic .
wonderful spot that serves up more than hot dogs .
the food is superbly prepared .
the meatballs are excellent and the fries well-prepared .
prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is fun .
the caesar was lightly dressed with full flavor .
"this place makes excellent food , however ."
the chicken shish kebab is absolutely wonderful .
dorado is also quite well-done as well .
turkish coffee is supposedly quite good from dining companions .
some limitations of the place are the somewhat <UNK> .
"excellent food , hands down ."
the happy hour deal is likewise excellent .
the salmon robata is well-seasoned and prepared perfectly .
interesting find in the strip district .
while making rum in pittsburgh seems out of place .
"from the start , the experience was subpar ."
things that are generally automatic elsewhere .
the sides were matched in quality .
the texture of their sausage is smooth and refined .
service is also great .
ca n't say enough good things about the place .
i went as part of a work party .
there was a set menu that seemed promising .
<UNK> whiskey is fantastic .
will leave it at that .
"cheese corn was decent , but not spectacular ."
excellent beer at this newly opened brewery in lawrenceville .
the owner is a down to earth guy .
they also serve half growlers which is great .
nice new louis vuitton at the city center .
0 floors i believe .
i travel to las vegas a lot .
we left very unimpressed .
the cheese was good .
i do n't see the rage .
however they would not install it .
"its not pizza , its <UNK> ."
the wine list is impressive but overpriced .
the <UNK> balls were great .
i had the meatloaf .
it was comfort food at its best .
this embassy suites is ok .
sat for 00 minutes and never got served .
left for mexican restaurant across the street .
the flavor and cuts of meat were very perfect .
the menu selection is easy and not complicated .
top quality food and ambiance .
it starts with the reservation .
the oreo cheescake and maple bacon are my favorites .
bottomless wine and i think beer too .
pork loin was lean but dry .
good vegas dim sum is hard to come by .
the non smoking room smelled like a smoking room .
the service is horrible here .
please never go here follow friends .
circus circus is better than this .
they had closed and asked me what i needed .
will buy from these folks .
you wo n't be disappointed .
"below average food , but pricey ."
crepes awesome ... eggs benedict ruled too .
"warm , friendly atmosphere ... the service was excellent ."
he was very relaxed and casual about his <UNK> .
now for the negatives .
thanks for helping me out guys .
<UNK> did an awesome job on a tough room .
portions as big as two of your heads !
do n't plan on having phone reception there .
"the buffet area , however , was very small ."
it did n't get much better .
i went there with my girlfriend and daughter .
i had the sesame chicken .
i think the sashimi plate is the only exception .
my girlfriend and i ate here tonight .
"i , however had the lamb <UNK> ."
food was pretty good as well .
nothing but the highest recommendations here .
the property itself and staff are top shelf .
reviewed by a 00 ' s something traveller .
"the kicker , however was the side of bacon ."
excellent service ... and coffee rounded out this experience .
: - rrb - nice place to eat .
these guys here in phoenix are right on .
good pizza and good service .

"cool in concept , but lacks in execution ."
the short answer is yes .
she ' s so fly she <UNK> 000 wings .
we ordered the meat lovers .
poutine was more of a 0 star on one .
ate here the other day with my wife .
great asian food spot .
just good decent asian food .
best burger i ' ve had in years .
their fries and gravy sauce was top notch .
will be going again as soon as i can .
"and <UNK> , if i ever become a <UNK> ."
this was a very bizarre land of <UNK> .
the alleged entertainment certainly did n't earn it .
"the prices can be stunningly reasonable , depending ."
. i do not know what happened .
they do n't deserve any business .
i had the breakfast buffet .
plenty to eat and the food was very good .
this review is for the breakfast buffet .
i hit the buffet jackpot today .
this gets my highest recommendation for a buffet anywhere .
buffets are what they are .
very nice modern bistro type of look .
0 minutes go by ... still not seated .
another guy comes up ... he gets seated immediately .
best hot dogs in town .
the person at the front desk was completely disorganized .
best tacos i have had in a long time .
will and have driven far for these tacos .
went in for care at 0:00 pm .
fine job on the simple items and plate presentations .
shuttles leave every 00-00 min .
always go there if there is a choice .
golf course is always in good condition .
good pizza if you like chicago style pizza .
sometimes i like this kind of pizza for dinner .
give this place a try for lunch or dinner .
this place always runs at least an hour behind .
a good local course .
they also have it on monday i believe .
greens are fast but not to fast .
always recommend this to my friends .
the room was newly remodeled and was fine .
the restaurant provide a good meal .
"it was around 000pm , so not too busy ."
the place is breathtaking and resembles an italian villa .
the service was impeccable and everything you would expect .
"perhaps don <UNK> could , but not me ."
never had anything bad here .
the portions are big and everything is prepared fresh .
the seafood chowder and corned beef are equally scrumptious .
"anyways , on to the food ."
do n't come here if you ' re hungry .
bottom line - - its amazing .
the flavors are remarkable .
"all in all , thoroughly first rate ."
not military friendly ! ! ! especially with <UNK> .
my id should be sufficient enough .
my only other complaint was my meal was cold .
great shop with a good group of mechanics .
"a perfectly comfortable hotel , clean and <UNK> ."
the wireless internet is abysmal .
"- lrb - why , grand concourse ?"
the hash felt ... um ... assembled .
the whole trader vic ' s experience .
tonight is no exception .
at least my <UNK> is strong .
we also ordered chicken enchiladas with a black mole .
not even in the same ballpark as <UNK> <UNK> .
"the food , presentation , quality was very good ."
never going to dine at this establishment again .
"jay , gave me the worst service , ever !"
feel free to check out my other reviews .
what an asset to your team .
the place is closed for good .
health code violations up the <UNK> yang .
wings are better than most elsewhere .
fish and chips is also excellent .
great beer selection as well .
stopped by on a whim .
was visiting the area .
it has stuff in it .
the <UNK> were good .
the room had a great view of the <UNK> .
i ended up not using it .
"also , very friendly service ."
the taste is very authentic and flavorful .
this certainly makes the entire meal a bit unappetizing .
the soggy bun really turned me off .
it was very watery and had very little flavor .
certainly not a good impression on me .
not sure what went wrong today .
"my wife ordered a berry , chocolate concoction ."
certainly not worth the price .
"the soup , however , was very tasty ."
"the meals , in general , were very bland ."
delicious food and entertaining chefs .
good sandwich for a midnight run .
the <UNK> fried potatoes were edible .
the crazy chicken it is then ' ' .
also do your best to get a table outside .
opened up yelp to find a local place nearby .
so take this assessment for what you will .
the burgers not bad either .
hooters is definitely showing its age though .
the hotel is in need of a facelift .
"located inside hooters , is the mad onion restaurant ."
hooters is a vegas frat house oriented party hotel .
worst subway you could go to .
i asked for the oven roasted chicken footlong .
and then wipe it on their uniforms .
i have the power to make things happen .
how about i pay for his meal ?
that was a very humble thing to say .
you have a quality leader in joel <UNK> .
definitely worth going out of your way for .
good wine and beer selection at affordable pricing .
heard about this place for quite some time .
good wine and great food at reasonable prices .
one of the steaks was completely undercooked .
glad they ' re finally on yelp !
fun atmosphere and great food .
great service and food .
awsome place to bring out-of-town friends .
love the <UNK> - cabin vibe .
the naked margarita was actually better than i expected .
"overall , great new place for downtown ."
have n't been back in months .
very cool decore and friendly staff .
we started our meal with jalapeno popper ' s .
they were cooked perfectly with a lightly toasted bun .
the beer was ice cold and fantastic .
i highly recomend this place .
burgers are a bit dry .
for a quick fast meal it ' s fine .
the potatoes were up there also .
tryst staff did n't fail ... they delivered .
highly recommend for a diner on the go .
the energy in the place is awesome and infectious .
the dinner menu was surprisingly deep .
they certainly have something for everyone .
someone that actually takes care of customers .
do n't pass up this one .
i have visited this place 0 times now .
first trip : with my wife and daughter .
i heard you say beef ' ' .
finally i was not the only one to notice .
"arrived there with my wife , and two daughters ."
i mean it covered the entire plate .
"awesome burritos , made any way you want ."
overall the food is great .
i was told about this place from a co-worker .
should i save the bad for last ?
first the taste is <UNK> .
i was back for more pies in 0 days .
the <UNK> mud i out of the <UNK> .
the hotel and clientele reflect this .
casino - fair at best .
the food was excellent .
nice selection of food .
the service is always great .
stay away at all costs .
this is an illegal and unethical business practice !
tried <UNK> ' s for lunch today .
service was prompt and attentive .
cool atmosphere and decent local craft beer .
solid tap list as well .
good food and good value as well .
great food and atmosphere .
enjoyed a few beers and cocktails as well .
what a great restaurant .
the club it self is great .
i do not recommend the shuttle service at all .
"now , the bad news ."
no way are they serving prime beef .
"for $ 00.00 per strip , i expect perfection ."
two stars only because apps and sides are superb .
"overall , this place has my thumbs up ."
' ' apparently very good .
i stuck to a lot of the vegetables .
i made the biggest mistake of my life .
most of their restaurant are pretty good as well .
their appetizers are all free and refillable .
their huli huli chicken is great too .
buldogis is really too hard to describe in words .
this place is definitely worth a try .
had a vanilla custard with cookie dough .
great place to do whatever you can imagine .
think of a place to eat .
this place is nothing special .
"nothing special , but not awesome ."
i recommend ordering the bok choy with your curry .
the prime rib was nothing special .
"we get one free , right ?"
"0 stars for the ice cream , nothing else ."
"i expect heart attack worthy , great tasting food ."
"nothing special , nothing bad really ."
this is my new favorite sushi place .
every other visit before has been great .
i also recommend the tempura ice cream for desert .
"not a bad place , but not the best ."
this place is one of my food <UNK> .
dinner gets a little expensive .
they have traditional and modern options on the menu .
tried a sampler of beers .
no more ground meat for this guy .
the bbq was dry and overcooked .
the best part was the omelet bar .
overall the staff was very professional and friendly .
limits are also reasonable on a saturday night .
only pro : no resort fees .
they ' ve earned my business and respect .
fish was excellent obviously .
gon na have to look in to that .
the only downside is the menu is too big .
fantastic as always best meal in town .
"the best beer , food , and ambiance ."
i am a 00 year old united states veteran .
i was disgusted with the total disregard .
doing a project for my parents ' 00th anniversary .
i brought in a dozen 00 year old pictures .
conveniently located on windmill just east of the 000 .
in and out quick .
used to be full restaurant around corner from me .
one of the few quick healthy options around .
excellent food and a great monday night crowd .
"good food , atmosphere and owners ."
keep up the good work !
all lacked flavor and were somewhat bland .
"you name it , they can probably do it ."
paul our server was courteous and superb .
- the atmosphere is definitely bar style .
"generally , it is n't a problem ."
- the service is <UNK> and occasionally disinterested .
pros : - the food is inventive and outstanding .
"however , the quality is far better ."
"i have always been satisfied , but not <UNK> ."
food : the menu has improved significantly !
skip the roasted nuts as an appetizer .

service is at the counter and is friendly enough .
parking was n't a problem .
pros : - the <UNK> tofu is outstanding .
- the interior is awesome .
embrace it and you ' ll be fine .

payment : cash or check only .
what more could you ask for ?
service can range from rockstar to lame .
the atmosphere is casual .
"for the vegetarian rolls , the price was reasonable ."
you are seated very close to your neighbor .
eat here is definitely a mixed bag .
- the restaurant has aged poorly .
do n't look behind the wok counter .
challenging with children because the buffet is quite high .
i tend to steer clear of the <UNK> dishes .
i would classify that as poor service .
service : the server was very friendly and courteous .
bacon was top quality .
had the chicken polo and burrito .
this place is a waste of time and money .
the biggest problem was the way they handle business .
good broad selection of <UNK> .
thank for reading and enjoy .
i approve this message .
i approve this message .
"fantastic stay , great restuarant , and cocktail ."
$ 00.00 for all you can eat ?
the rolls were good in size and pretty flavorful .
they have the best fish and chips .
service and quality decline drastically if it is busy .
it starts before you even walk in the door .
that is true for me in this case .
the skill level of these dentists is exceptional .
great food and much improved service .
best italian food around .

"if you settle , keep your receipt !"
have n't tried too much of the grub yet .

poor management sense ; poorly run business .
half price apps 0-0 daily .
live music on some nights .

my experience was certainly much better .
the food is excellent ... holy garlic heaven .
"and , yes ... amazeballs ."
best stuff on earth .
phenomenal service in a chic yet friendly atmosphere .
amazing choices of great drafts .
the beer makes it worth it .
that ' s a third inappropriately i <UNK> .
the meats are very well prepared and incredibly rich .
made like pork belly .
warm and wonderful staff .
i payed $ 00 to replace the screen .
large parties are ok .
just not to many .
great place to stay in vegas .
the lines can get long .
lots of other deserts that are amazing and great .
. its in that small little silver pot .
they do great work .
she was very skeptical until she had a wing .
so the final score was 0-0 .
the buildings look great but are very poor quality .
singapore rice noodles : surprisingly good .
will probably be back to try other items .
this place certainly surprised me .
we decided to give this place a shot .
"of course , there were no apologies ."
"normally , not a big deal ."
not a hint of peanut .
how long does it take to make a sandwich ?
the sizzling hot plate beef arrived first .
"great atmosphere , free drinks , and kind staff ."

"tamales were decent , as was the <UNK> pollo ."
the naan bread is fantastic .
there ' s something for everyone here .

the atmosphere is pretty surreal though .
0:00 to 0:00 pm i favor curry dishes .

this is thee spot for poutine while in montreal .
"ok , i get it ."
could n't be happier .
"the rooms are clean , the location is good ."

it ' s a greasy spoon .

while there was a large selection of different bbq .
the only plus was louisiana bbq .
it had a large line but it was justified .
they had the best flavor and bbq sauce .
the food is excellent .
before the renovation this place was a dump .
first let me review the food / service .
i ordered the bacon cheddar burger medium .
now to the real issue .
just your standard stuff and it hit the spot .
the service was excellent as well .
everyone was exceptional from a service stand point .
and they fired on all cylinders without a hitch .
well that ' s what makes it awesome .
the pizza was excellent .
quality ingredients with a perfect done crust .
got a table right away and server was nice .
both draught and bottle beers .
and talk about a lot of food .
the standard fries are steak fries .
wonder if that will be consistent every time .
the food was very average .
overall the food was at least consistent .
i now see why this place was dead .
every flavor no matter which you choose is outstanding .
the eggs benedict are excellent .
the food was outstanding .
great seasoning and excellent combination of flavors .
i ordered the braised short ribs .
what more can i say .
"great food , great prices , great service ."
then look no further .
excellent coffee all around .
left a lot to be desired .
the food however was average at best .
not something i ' d expect from a restaurant .
much more flavor and freshness there .
this place is excellent .
usually a mix of new age and jazz .
the staff and service was top notch .
i ordered a two piece combo .
which is two pieces of fish with fries .
the fish was terrible .
everything was bland and fries were undercooked .
booze everywhere how bad can it be .
ready to answer any questions we had .
id give it 0.0 but not quite 0 .
it was n't amazing but was slightly above average .
the service was great no complaints there .
not bad not great .
overall service was good but experience was just ok .
not much more i can ask for .
price is 0.00 for a 00 ' ' .

so many to choose from .
staff was extremely friendly so no issues there .
on to the food .

i have been going since it opened .
great tasting pizza everything .

not bad but nothing great either .
just meh ! ! below avg .
. came in during lunch .
very friendly to answer any questions you might have .
nothing fancy just great execution .
i usually order a little hamburger .
just in time for football season .
overall they just lacked flavor .
just bland over all .
as far as the food .
price also seemed a bit high but nothing crazy .
one of my favorites for breakfast or lunch .
great quality and excellent ambiance .
has a very local contemporary feel .
either way not a good sign .
two more dead ones along the wall .
once inside our service was excellent .
could have had the same quality at pei wei .
pretty good for being a chain bbq place .
the bbq is also excellent .
also if you like a good spicy bbq sauce .
try mixing the devils spit with the texas pit .
ca n't say that about many chain restaurants .
everything was over cooked and dry and over salted .
but the catfish - oh the catfish !
they fried chicken was really good .
great bbq sauce too .
the food was awesome .
i ordered the fukumimi ramen and karaage .
went with a buddy to check out the ayce .
even the nigiri sushi selection was limited .
very torn doing this review .
the food was all very tasty .
you ca n't go wrong .
every single item was tasty as hell .
"overall , brilliant place ."
best sushi i ' ve had in montreal .
best beef brisket i have ever eaten .
the menus are on the wall and change constantly .
really nice hotel with great rooms .

the beans and bbq sauces were great .
"decent prices , good food , excellent service ."
even the <UNK> flatware is striking .
i ' ll be back on my next trip .
"it is n't the nicest place , yet ."
ok less choices are sometimes a good thing .
my buddy ordered chicken fried bacon and eggs .
i ordered a burrito .
our bill with coffees was around 00 bucks .
i ' ll be back .
it is worth stopping in for one drink .
my buddy opted for the chicken and waffles .
i can now say i ate here .
nothing special but nothing terrible .
where we were was the place to be .
this was a highlight of my trip .
she could not have cared less .
another 00 minutes later the food showed up .
"0 different dishes all bland , lacked seasoning ."
incredible bone-in double pork chop with absolutely no flavor .
too much bacon in recipes .
two unsuccessful attempts on quail .
too many good tapas choices in charlotte .
and nobody in my family smokes .
stains on the carpet and chair seating area .
and that it had aired out pretty good .
ok at least they are trying i guess .
but this place is a joke .
just hard to believe people can just not care .
these guys nail it .
very light on the stomach .
good cuban sandwich today .
"great food , quick service , great prices !"
diner food at steakhouse prices .
avoid this if you can .
"same great menu , same great taste !"
"great lunch spot , good sandwich and salads ."

justin and his crew are good people !
the standard breakfast is fine .
the unusual items are just unusual .
tribe is a great shop with a fantastic staff .
seems like they may be new .
great place for lunch meetings .
just above average bar food .
where else are you going to get cuban food ?

great atmosphere and everything is a little better there .
i had a nice lunch there this week .
i have eaten here many times .
good place for a very nice dinner .
best thai food in the valley .
excellent chicken tikka masala .
"ok , the <UNK> stuff is growing on me ."
this is some very good mexican .
maybe my favorite in the phoenix area .
i think the slow cooked pork is the deal .
"trustworthy , safe , experienced ."
"it is a unique place , very old phoenix ."
the light nightclub is a ripoff .
my family was in las vegas recently .
this place is terrible .
"all in all , a great meal ."
we popped in and found a spot pretty quickly .
the wife enjoyed some juice .
total tab : $ 00 .
"otherwise , getting chairs or a cabana is impossible ."
the best looking people were the wait staff .
that should say it all .
go at your own risk .
the worst rental car company at phx airport .
great burgers and fries .
dolce milkshake is off the charts .
will be a frequent visitor .
recommended by local friends who live in vegas .
this place did not miss a beat .
a great plus was the owners hands on approach !
lunch is less expensive of course .
well worth searching it out !
food was decent but on the expensive side .
the games on sports tv channels was comprehensive .
it comes in chunky and creamy .
worst wings i have had .
last time i eat here .
one positive is most of the staff are friendly .
i would not eat here .
wished they would open one up closer to home .
this just became my new favorite bbq joint .
the service was excellent .
saying this hotel is below average is kind .
the rooms are old and small .
the people at this hotel are ignorant .
these guys never let me down .
always my go to for good food though .
hey so ... uhh .
unprofessional to keep people waiting .
' ' until going to <UNK> .
"and thus , i highly recommend <UNK> ."
got the red curry for lunch .
the building looks like a former <UNK> restaurant .
the appetizers leave a bit to be desired .
the ambiance is excellent .
the price is appropriate .
i often take business partners here for lunch .
the pho is boring and $ 00 a bowl .
same goes for the cocktails .
"the fusion spring rolls are inspired , but expensive ."
i have two words of advice : star anise .
the menu was inspired .
doubt i ' ll be coming back .
"excellent food , server , and setting ."
great saturday night dinner place for young professionals .
does this sound like competent maintenance ?
bend over backwards for you type staff .
looking forward to becoming a regular .
katie <UNK> and jeff !
they made phoenix cool again with this spot .
$ 0.00 kilt lifter helps too .
this hotel needs to be renovated and maintained .
the hallway rugs need stretching and cleaning .
outside the property the area is strewn with garbage .
do yourself a favor and stay someplace else .
owner came by and made sure everything was good .
the chicken burrito is an absolute must .
i hear the burgers are amazing .
but this bar has become my cheers bar !
ordered their special for pizza and 00 spicy wings .
otherwise its $ 0 for a bottle of beer .
it takes use of its old department store space !
it is the best i have ever had .
"prices are decent , spending about 00 for two ."
i have earned my business !
keep up the good work .
this food is no joking matter .
the scenery as others have noted is stunning .
let ' s begin at the end .
had nice citrus notes and a sweet potato <UNK> .
great food in a bistro type atmosphere .
best italian food around .
i recommend the general tso ' s chicken .
what ' s up with that .
the <UNK> is monster delicious .
the atmosphere was very cool .
great place and better staff .
this is a true gem for charlotte !
i would highly recommend .
avoid at all costs .
"the sooner , the better ' ' ."
. tues pa came in to check on him .
the food is good .
it can be kind of smoky inside .
you wo n't leave hungry .
great value for the price .
management should be embarrassed with the condition .
staff not too friendly .
the staff are also friendly .
my experience though was far away from great .
the burger also forgettable as well as the fries .
i might do it and might update this post .
"pretty good flavor , serving and price ."
this spot is quite a pleasant surprise .
nothing not to love about this place .
quick service and comfortable dining room .
cheers what a beautiful building .
the food was above ok but not memorable .
nice addition to the area .
"this is an interesting place , for sure ."
but this is out of the subject .
a great place that worth the trip .
i ' ll be back soon .
this place is a pretty solid 0 stars !
watermelon salad and gnocci with meat .
i ' ll be back within two weeks .
rustic with a touch of elegant .
i had the angel hair chilly pasta with shrimp .
the security guys are ruining this cool joint .
"decent pizza , good greek salad , fair prices ."
"nice guacamole , crispy chips , tasteful salsas ."
they were pretty tasteful .
but why sushi instead of improving their flagship dish ?
"oh well , 0 solid stars ."
the best part were the hors d'oeuvres .
i had the burger which was ok .
cheers the place is awesome .
"nice decor , comfortable , a great ambiance ."
the evoo that came with it was pretty tasteful .
i ' ll keep this review short and simple .
the food is good but not great .
the agnolotti were interesting but forgettable .
the sweet potato cheesecake is out of this world .
the kids spaghetti with meat sauce is great .
a great place to become a regular .
i do n't miss those douches at all lmao !
let me start with the place .
cheers highly recommended for a romantic dinner .
great food and good service .
prices are n't that bad for vegas standards .
both pretty solid dishes .
quaint little place hidden in mesa az . .
nice front bar and reasonable prices .
pretty decent wine list .
the food was average at the most .
for the price the place is not worth it .
the desert was to die for .
cheers let ' s start with the place .
nice decor and comfortable lay out .
the deserts were hit and miss .
what a great place .
they have a great beer section .
i had a <UNK> pizza .
let ' s start with the place .
two of them would be more than plenty .
we <UNK> a chicken sandwich with buffalo wing sauce .
"the desert was good , though ."
over $ 000 for 0 without alcohol .
i guess this place really honors its name .
pretty arrogant yet just a butcher .
it seems that they replaced the beets for strawberries .
salad was barely average .
for desert i had the rum and coke .
no taste of rum or coke what so ever .
long wait although decent service .
cheers can beat good food for a decent price .
the tea was tasteful and the serving was generous .
great food and a lot of gluten free options .
"the caprese salad was superb , hands down ."
i ' ll be back soon .
cheers great location and ambiance .
the chicken can be skipped .
so why did n't i give it 0 stars ?
the sides were below lame .
the mac and cheese and cheese potatoes were tasteless .
slate martini and lemoncello are certainly highly recommended .
everything is tasteful here .
"nice setting , average food ."
the lamb was too salty .
"good amount of food , good taste ."
they place could be also a little cleaner .
i had the filet and it was well executed .
the soup and salad were also excellent .
the fried rice was above average .
i ' ll be back for sure .
a little too pricey for what you get .
` ` sharing is caring ' ' .
very solid and well presented dishes .
good service although a little slow .
the table slightly smelled like a dirty cleaning cloth .
cheers the kitchen table for kids is the bomb .
humongous servings and good taste .
rosemary side potatoes could be skipped .
let me start with the food .
otherwise you ' ll be disappointed .
a little burn and dry but pretty decent .
the place is just beautiful with great service .
"nice decor , decent food and prices ."
a good neighborhood joint with decent food .
great place for a quick bite .
a little off from the mexican <UNK> .
"the best part , the <UNK> torta ."
"good food , consistent , fast ."
i went there twice already .
the fries were good .
i ca n't believe this place averages 0 stars .
what ' s wrong with people ?
0th of july waiting time : 0 hour .
the fried rice with beef tasted like burned oil .
"great food , great service and fair prices ."
"the place , as all <UNK> is really nice ."
with a hint of smoked flavor was really interesting .
the short rib was fair but nothing memorable .
cheers this is for sure a hidden gem .
good wine selection and kind and friendly service .
"the shrimp cocktail is great , with fresh cucumber ."
the service was pretty good and friendly .
a little too grease and overpriced .
nothing not to love about this place .
very tasty and a perfect serving .
this place worth the visit for sure .
why do you open without half of the menu ?
"i had the brisket , ribs and pulled pork ."
cheers o em <UNK> what a tragedy !
i ordered some sort of noodles with chicken .
they figured it out .
just the place and decor is worth the visit .
the food was just ok though .

the deserts were sort of childish .
over priced and under whelmed .
a 00oz is 0.00 if i remember correctly .
what kind of vegas hotel is this ?
oh yeah does n't even have a casino .
location sucks full of <UNK> .
never staying off the strip again .

two words ` ` pleasure pit .
about the room itself .

was not able to use my gift card here .
service was very very friendly .
"good food , good service , bad coffee ."
terrific seats can be had at a reasonable price .
sound was well mixed .
great venue for a great show .
basic burgers / cheeseburgers were not on the menu .
i ' m sure my arteries will complain later .
staff also has a sense of humor .
the steak was excellent .
nobody claimed to have ever seen it .
it was like a small self contained mall .
"gr , are you listening ?"
major problem : the toilet did not work properly .
the facilities provided were good - projector and screen .
the second day of hot options were very good .
waiter was nice guy .
i was embarrassed to be associated .
this place is old school vegas .
"so much character , its literally overwhelming ."
the room : well decorated and comfortable .
natalie is the owner and she is awesome .
my cod was cold .
i do not recommend .
left me unsatisfied and in a low energy vibe .
these guys offer up some awesome service .

a hybrid of a nightclub and mexican food restaurant .

the place is just soso .

the owner is a jerk .
pizza was average at best .
<UNK> pecan pie ale is awesome !
i tried the kung pao chicken .
the breakfasts are standard fare and decent .
previously simply declining the resort fee was enough .
this place is massive ... just massive .
appeared like it had n't ever been swept .
dead bug smashed into the wall behind door .
<UNK> and really sketchy people walking around the hotel .
the deviled eggs were a touch <UNK> .
now lets get to the food .
"its was huge , tasty , juicy ."
the highlight had to be the fries .
the bill came out to $ 00.00 usd .
yes that ' s right $ 00.00 .
the sandwiches were incredible .

monique rocked the bar and made the evening fun .
great happy hour and lunch specials .

this is where the <UNK> shines the most .
"needless to say , the location is awesome ."
the place is well kept .
i had the bacon fried rice which was excellent .
i arrived at the restaurant ten minutes before opening .
i visited envy around 0pm with a few friends .
the waiter then argued that it was veal .
the downfall in their decor is the fake plants .
i would give this place two stars at most .
but it all just really sucks .
where do i start with this place ?
the flatware and glasses were spotty .
they had no sympathy .
great tasty chicago food .
this is the value pizza joint in the area .
many items on menu unavailable .
had to ask for water refills .
tried this place out .
had to wait a long place out .
never got offered refills .

"you ca n't , no-one ca n't ."
i am very impressed with their poker room .
i have spent 0 separate stays here .
the place is huge .
the assortment is grand .
no ... they almost got it right .
one cashier taking multiple orders from one customer .
"really enjoyed the potbelly burger , very flavorful ."
"get the jack mac , very good ."
"the food was excellent , the spread comprehensive ."
wrong menus were given .
main courses were delivered late .
food was okay for buffet standards .
do n't be fooled by the inexpensive rating .
food was spicy and well prepared .
the place was extremely clean .
first doing all the planning was pretty easy .
it would be good to take a date there .
handful of tv ' s on the wall too .
the drink menus are pretty good too .
"overall , i would recommend going to this place ."
bottom line : extremely over rated .
definitely glad i stopped here .
and a cycle gear customer for life
"nice family owned place , with really good food ."
the people behind the counter are very nice too .
definitely cheaper than most comparable places .
"staff had no personality , either ."
this is after a year of use .

this place comes really close .

we ' re off to a great start .
my girlfriend and i both ordered pasta dishes .
friendly guys making excellent food - my kinda people .
but the service was 0 stars .
<UNK> has a selection that ca n't be beat .
you guys call zucchini ` ` <UNK> ' ' ?
there is also weekly trivia and open mic nights .
"still , no hard feelings golf ."
see you later today .
use to be a great bar .
free refills is one of them .
do n't believe the hype .
the brisket was phenomenal .
just off the smoker .
my family and i stopped here tonight .
i ordered veal with peppers .
will never go back to this place again .
"consistency is key , and this place just isnt ."
the brisket the same as the pork .
we have been treated very well .
"they speak in simple terms , easy to understand ."
have taken all our dogs there for several years .
"dirty , food on floor ."
regular menu also available .
will adapt food to diet .

"as usual , the food was great ."
trying to get out of the mexican food funk ?
on the other hand the food was really good .
kudos to you and your staff .
you made us feel very welcome in charlotte .
however - the beer here is divine !
it ' s a fantastic stout based beer .
"nice place , but a little pricey ."
they did a great job staying in character .
worst dining experience of my life .
our reservation was at 00:00 pm .
about a half hour later .
they finally showed up a half hour later .
"great burgers , great service ."
that would involve common sense .
the trivia nights on thursdays are fun .
"great ambiance , great steak , excellent service ."
the sauces on the enchilada were perfect though .
"polite , fast , friendly , and professional ."
"my word , my family , and my beer ."
the bartender was extensively knowledgable of his entire menu .
this place will not make two .
the wifi in my room is fast .
great service and a cool looking restaurant .
so only 0/0 star off .
good place but not in my top favorites .
not a destination stop but a great second choice .
so ... nice decor good drinks and excellent food .
i would like to see it opened up more .
but that is not a reason to stay away .
the coffee is good and the cup is bottomless .
a nice local bar and grill .
they have a large selection of beer .
they do it all well and at reasonable prices .
this place does an amazing job .
it looks like a cool place to hang out .
now the most important part of the store .
and the praline was decadent .
this was a tough call .
i <UNK> wanted to give it four stars .
it was a very comfortable place .
"thin crust , <UNK> crust , great sauce flavor ."
you wo n't be disappointed .
our palms <UNK> the lines <UNK> in our skin .
you have to go there to see it .
and they also have these amazing mints in vegas .
much better than carrabba ' s .
it ' s on the se corner .
then it seems to pick up in that department .
pints are a little expensive at $ 0 each .
the salads came fast and were very good .
the flavor was bland and the pasta was overcooked .
it was almost a mushy consistency .
this review is only based on one visit .
i think it might be worth a second look .
but back to the review .
ok they do n't but they should .
now on to the highlight .
i believe these are all extra costs .
"the only caveat , is the price ."
i stand at the entrance waiting for my date .
i finally caved in and asked for some water .
but all in all it was a great experience .
i remember when nypd first opened up .
do you like my use of <UNK> adjectives ?
what is life without pizza ?
the quality is <UNK> .
it ' s a local hangout that worth going .
the food is good .
the food served here is carefully and delicately crafted .
probably not going to eat here again .
the creme brule desert was actually pretty good .
big deserts in a really fun atmosphere .
not my first trip here either .
"for a diner , the food is pretty good ."
"just remember , this is not the bellagio ."
have i had better sushi ?
so this was my first experience which was bad .
would definitely not recommend to stay here .
that is how good it is !
great burgers and even better dogs .
exceptional service and top notch massage great tacos !
as good as it gets .
response to don m on 0/00 .
the value for the actual grocery is so so .
and the selection is a little limited .
"found this place on groupon , wow ."
which makes me hope they are well compensated .
chic and trendy while still retaining a welcoming feel .
what more can you offer ?
"service , which place completely lacked ."
"further , there was a complete disregard for sanitation ."
some are available for purchase .
awesome server who also worked in the bar .
ordered the shrimp new orleans .
i would have gladly paid full price .
the steak & chicken were excellent .
so good i spilled it <UNK> my shirt .
i love the japanese <UNK> there .
all these places are like chinese mcdonald ' s .
", ie chow main , and fried rice ."
we ordered a chicken buffet and the beef .
the service guy ask if that would be ok .
should have been at least one left .
wow home made sauce !
ordered the pork rules pizza online .
"pizza looked , smelled , and tasted great !"
i was an on time appointment for ten am .
where is the true honesty in what they do ?
they let people sit in broken seats ?
they let people sit in broken seats ?
korean beer was good too .
prices seemed normal to the cost of living .
dang this place is the bomb !
"for me , the gambling was just mediocre ."
"excellent service , good ambiance ."
"sashimi was exceptional , service was great ."
service and ambiance - - excellent .
jumbo shrimp cocktail almost worth the trip .
been in twice to get a quote .
i wo n't be back a third time .
"great dudes , great prices , fast service ."
i ' ll be back .
make sure you introduce yourself to the chef .
"in fact , seats are downright uncomfortable ."
"just fresh ingredients and good , thinner crust pizzas ."
and they deliver on campus .
"for a special treat , try the persian donut ."
"be wary , it will fill you up though ."
what a dump compared to walmart and target .
ok i admit their burgers are very good .
perhaps they are trying hard to improve .
it ' s an ice cream cone .
monta ' s ramen is good .
"only 0 mins from home , ca n't wait ."
my japanese wife shops here once a week .
the employees are mature and very service oriented .
great asian store in bad location .
no respect because nobody here to enforce the rules .
i reported to animal control and park police .
large dog poo all over the place too .
watch their prices closely cause they throw curve balls .
"watch yourselves , they are sneaky ."
service at the bar is friendly and competent .
the one real problem is the weekend .
all they have available is the low sodium version .
i can see why .
then our main dishes arrive .
you ' ll be much happier .
the service is where things start to fall apart .
ordered : <UNK> no sauce .
both bowls had thin noodles .
when the bill came we realized why .
coffee ' s not bad .
mainly i like the place for the variety .
i recently had the bacon chili burrito dog .
a standard of japanese restaurants all over .
the service was acceptable .
my bill was $ 00 .
$ 00.00 for a rice bowl is insane .
at least the <UNK> was n't bad .
her crepe cost $ 00 .
and the basic offerings are sorely lacking .
"because it is worth doing , just not there ."
the bartenders are top notch .
i ' ve been here several times .
broken <UNK> pressure cap ?
garlic knots are acceptable .
"good food nearby , easy to get to ."
"friendly , capable , knowledgeable ."
for a place so small the selection is excellent .
in the last year something has happened .
almost none of the <UNK> are present .
stay away from the popcorn .
"my favourite japanese restaurant in town , bar none ."
cocktail offerings are amateurish .
then they missed an appointment .
no problems with them at all .
the best hash i have ever had .
"great burgers , pure and simple ."
i had the buffalo burger in the plain bun .
the location of the hotel is very centric .
the overall the meal was very good .
some may find that annoying .
and everything was remarkable .
great view of the strip .
this is not any old ferris wheel .
breakfast at mon ami gabi was excellent .
"fun experience , average food ."
the environment is odd .
the shows duration was satisfying .
the meats were delicious with a good variety .
this library has a very big emphasis on family .
the cognac duck was delicious !
they sent some other options that were not compelling .
my home is in gated community as well .
my go to taco is usually the lengua .
"love the salad bar , clean great choices ."
one of the best burgers in town !
. place has a great vibe .
this is my first yelp review btw .
so good job original breakfast house !
came in on super bowl sunday .
service was 0 star .
this was an atrocious response to a pleasant request .
the staff promptly sat us .
scotch egg was awesome .
the rib eye was perfectly cooked .
the service was not very attendant .
"unlike prior experiences , i was less than satisfied ."
i think they lost a customer .
these guys are truly amazing .
best locally owned bar in the area .
"great bar food , wings and pizza are great ."
hostess is very helpful when finding previously seated friends .
"the sauce , although good , is simply ordinary ."
it ' s more appetizer than dinner portion .
my girlfriend had more soup than i did linguini .
forgettable and lacking flavor .
here ' s my take : 0 .
check with your favorite phoenix steakhouse .
"the seafood is terrific , too ."
oh yeah and amazing beer .
definitely a kick ass buffet for the price .
"always friendly , and always great food ."
best bbq in the qc !
why ca n't every restaurant cook like this ?
damn those <UNK> automatic locks !
- rrb - and i had beef short ribs .
by 0:00 they began to clean up .
thank god for jet on saturday !
"so , first a full disclosure ."
but be sucked ass .
i went to old stone last october for lunch .
the wait staff was very polite and attentive .
love the 0000 ' s prohibition vibe in there .
i would recommend it over most italian places .
normally protein drinks like that are chalky or bland .
"great staff , <UNK> and charles were very nice ."
- lrb - hint : get the black irish !
not for the food though .
the falafels are quite good .
"0nd time <UNK> , utterly disappointed ."
im going to vomit right now thinking about it .
a true class act .
". fish stick taco , very tasty fish ."
the food i really good and is priced right .
very bad customer service .
we were greeted immediately upon entry .
the ny sirloin peppercorn steak was cooked perfectly .
"also , the <UNK> chicken sandwich is pretty ballin !"
so my review for this place is difficult .
the hot dog was good .
nothing really beats the classic approach .
"the highlight : everything , really ."
price : they are a little expensive .
they are a welcomed addition to the oakland area .
i recommend this burger !
their coffee leaves much to be desired .
"it is bland , <UNK> , and lacks <UNK> ."
the price is where i really knock them down .
they know the menu and also care .
<UNK> ' s is a pittsburgh / <UNK> institution .
"not the people , but the work ."
"this will never happen again , i promise you ."
the big man himself is amazing .
. a dentist i enjoy seeing .
long story short ... they ' re awesome .
the first is during the day as a restaurant .
the second view is at night as a bar .
i had the pizza dog and was very happy .
it definitely tests well against razzy fresh .
toppings : everything great .
only negative : cash only .
"this unfortunately , is a huge negative ."
i have nothing bad to say about this place .
"i recommend this place time , and time again ."
"also , any of the lamb plates are great ."
"the atmosphere is funky , casual , and dark ."
"stick with beer here , too ."
there is nothing bad about this place !
support this local gem !
the bun never got soggy and help up .
the toppings are all great .
this is my favorite <UNK> restaurant in the city .
the place - very cool and hip .
i was in a serious bind .
the wife of course loved it .
well drinks are $ 0 each .
"in addition , the food is not seasoned ."
nothing special about the burgers .
nothing was done to acknowledge the inconvenience .
hotel should just put that in the rate .
people are very personal hear .
its their signature drink !
"food was pretty good , except for several problems ."
issues came at checkout .
not send them away with a bad last impression .
will rethink where to take buddy next time .
ordered second sandwich off the same menu .
asked to wait while the order was <UNK> .
servers lindsay and heather were totally awesome .
both were prepared just right .
deserts of carrot cake and cheese cake were awesome .
server jenn was outstanding .
strongly recommend the bone-in rib-eye served iron crusted style .
props to the management team and the entire staff .
rock memorabilia is tastefully spaced and interesting .
bottom line is we love this place .
awesome classic rock playing made it even better !
"we received 0 meals , but had ordered 0 ."
blamed it on the kitchen .
at that point i ordered a second beer .
saw her sitting at a table texting .
a good value for the price .
second time was even better than the first .
"props to the owners , management and employees !"
i really hope this place is a continuing success .
a lot of excellent dishes to choose from .
very clean with friendly staff .
staff is extremely friendly and attentive .
my wife would give it a 0 star rating .
the food was well made .
like i said service is great .
food is going into your mouth .
reservations were at 0:00 pm .
pathetic excuse of 0 star service .
if you are lucky they call you back finally .
its very nice inside and out .
i had the pastor burrito and a beef taco .
the service was decent though .
very over priced for generic mexican food .
the salsa is like seasoned ketchup .
also 0 beer and 0 margarita .
the bill was $ 00 .
i felt i was treated very well .
"the food was ok , but not great ."
at least not the one at desert ridge .
the chicken was like chewing a piece of rubber .
worst $ 00 meal i ' ve ever had .
only and major downside .
"great service , great food ."
avoid this hospital if possible .
not much to say .
great barbecue and great atmosphere .
dropped by the northlake mall fb based on reviews .
obviously the chef and staff are good here .
enjoyed my fist experience at fb .
mary was also good at the bar .
"bartenders , servers , and security were phenomenal ."
the care for customers has drastically gone down .
this is an excellent place to eat .
the good is amazing and always cooked to perfection .
- rrb - at bourbon steak .
off the beaten path but well worth the trip .
the wait staff is top notch .
just that is worth the price of admission .
' ' said the staff .
the staff coordinated almost like a dining ballet .
can you fix this ?
"oh , and for all this around 00 bucks ."
not too shabby for a tasty shadyside lunch .
what a transformation this space has seen !
. that ' s how they ' re built .
ok drive ins diners and dives .
. like what does that mean .
. starting with a late dinner at the paris .
. so $ 00 .
my experiences at this location are always the same .
the store is full of these <UNK> .
today i encountered the same scenario .
the cashier never acknowledged those in line .
i ' m not kidding .
i am a man who cares about pancakes .
pamela ' s makes the best pancakes .
the home fries are also excellent .
hakkasan is known nation wide and has become popular .
all that was appealing was sound system & lasers .
the food is <UNK> .

the pork belly is also excellent .
very good value for a place on the strip .
"good italian salad , good wings ."
the baguettes are also excellent .
best buffet i ' ve ever had .
food was pretty good .
a great addition to the madison restaurant scene .

always a good time .
that is what this review is based on .
i just picked up a arizona burrito .
the burrito was cold and the meat was <UNK> .
good is consistently great .
i will be returning regularly after discover this place .
my only recommendation would be a better valet service .
prices are very good also .
i like the energy and watermelon flavor .
these guys care about customers ! ! !
this one is better than the one further out .
one reason is the service .
it was absolutely fantastic .
"anyway , back to the food ."
great bite to both .
the tempura kale appetizer was surprisingly good .
great bar open and friendly .
could n't get enough of the pork chops !
the dinner cost me 00 bucks .
i like this level .
i ' ll save that for my next trip .
food has always been good at this place .
i have been here at least 0 times .
i will be back to this place .
try the hot links .
this is a five star place .
severs are all great .
perhaps a half star deduction ?
food was good but place was a bit loud .
my girlfriend gets the curry .
all three experiences were very good .
gates are small and packed .
fast friendly service at checkout and checkin .
this place is a winner .
"food : check , check , check ."
perfect in every way .
spring rolls were very good .
we walked by here several times as hotel guests .
the service is average .
"the food is average , run-of-the-mill commercialized mexican ."
i had carne asada grilled tacos .
food presentation is completely lacking .
nothing stands out here .
great place to party and hang out with friends .
eggplant parmesan was very good .
food presentation was average .
prices seemed a bit high .
menu offers a nice array of italian offerings .
overall : very good .
the food was surprisingly good .
"outdoors , this place looks nice ."
parking wraps around the building in a motel fashion .
bed was very comfortable with great pillows .
went here with my brother and his wife .
over the top good no-frills mexican street food .
"attention , attention : this is a food court ."
nice venue for a comedy show .

nice outdoor patio with fire pits .
what ' s not to like about southwest airlines ?
"in skinny man vs . food , i lost ."
<UNK> had scrambled eggs w / sausage .
cappuccino and latte at both visits was outstanding .
lunch was similarly good .
service vastly needs improvement .
awesome <UNK> fills the room with steam .
nice clean efficient airport .
the concept is great .
the food was quite good but not as memorable .
"very good , basic american breakfast ."
they get it right with a rustic simple decor .
"the food was fresh , hot , and flavorful ."
freshly squeezed oj always gets a thumbs up .
staff was pleasant and well informed .
stupid me declined because i was in a rush .
"so , <UNK> pace is an appropriate <UNK> ."
no problems at the counter .
another 00 minutes of waiting .
the room initially assigned was occupied !
the room itself was average .
dipping sauce was better than the chicken .
"clean , efficient , and <UNK> airport ."
fairly easy to navigate .
the only parking is on the street .
server was knowledgeable and friendly .
i ' ve been here a few times .
great service amazing food .
okay back to the best burger place in america .
: - / this is my avis !
"in the end , we finally gave up ."
' ' - - asked one of the servers .
wish they would open one up in henderson !
should have checked yelp !
keep up the great work !
it has to be earned .
"fresh fish , stunning presentation , and friendly staff !"
i called to place a togo order .
"' ' ` ` yes , i am sure ."
' ' he took my payment and disappeared .
"this article was printed on may 0 , 0000 ."
"after reading the article , i shook my head ."
reviews and rosati ' s pizza got my attention .
' ' - - i finally lost my temper .
' ' 00 times again .
keep up the great work !
"welcome to las vegas , chef tony !"
me and my lady tried it .
service was very good .
forgot to leave a tip though .
some of the most genuine guys .
came in for a new motor .
. a new motor .
surprisingly it was easy .
week worth the few minute wait .
we will be back for sure .
got ta give them a try .
great choice for fast causal mexican !
0 stars is about right .
"some dishes work , others not that exceptional ."
lemon ricotta pancakes are awesome .
other breakfast items and sandwiches are consistently good .
service was indifferent and the meal dragged .
"<UNK> , who is this <UNK> critic ?"
"also , unbearably loud ."
burger and fries is $ 00 .
not too pricey for a breakfast place .
beet salad and chicken kale sandwich are our <UNK> .
probably prefer the mexican benedict the most .
brussel sprouts appetizer is sublime .
a great choice for a slightly upscale dinner .
better than lgo imo .
stetson salad remained singular .
reasonably good and fairly prices southwestern small plates .
macaroons live up to the hype .
perhaps the best thing in phx !
lunch items all <UNK> good .
too bad ca n't indicate zero .
burgers not particularly noteworthy .
very generously sized <UNK> .
but alas be prepared for a wait .
best sushi in madison i ' ve come across .
its good heated up or room temp .
just go eat here .
total hole in the wall diamond in the rough .
<UNK> is a friendly guy too .
"highly recommended , good food , fun service ."
hopefully just an isolated incident .
"tried them all , liked all of them ."
everything is 0-0 x more expensive than conventional groceries .
this dish alone would have been a 0 star .
only reason why my overall review is n't lower .
"really , really , really liked this place ."
would come back without hesitation .
it really should be built better .
"overall though , a phenomenal dining experience ."
<UNK> ' s hardware has worked well ... .
the service inside is outstanding .
definitely check this place out .
overall kudos to the entire staff and management !
considerably less than the nearby big brand casinos .
way too much sauce on the ribs .
i ' d stick with the pulled pork .
all the food has serious bbq flavor .
great staff that will make your visit more enjoyable .
way to go maple tree .
the view is awesome the servers are nice .
bravo to a casino / hotel well done !
most mediocre sub i ' ve ever eaten .
it really takes away from the whole experience .
sat at the bar and got terrible service .
"good food , fantastic flavors , and enthusiastic service ."
best mexican food in a very long time .
had the polo <UNK> and it was amazing .
made a great meal even better .
"awesome waffles , bacon really peppery ."
this place should be closed down .
close the place down tell your friends .
this place is crap .
go anyplace but here .
the tuna from cabo fish taco really tasted off .
drank local beer cowboy betty .
0.00 stars the sausage was also very good .
not sure if i was just unlucky .
it tasted better with the midwood sauce on it .
slaw tasted like it was mustard based .
not a fan of the mustard slaw .
. cole slaw was great .
staff were excellent and very friendly .
i will definitely include this in my next visit .
these guys have a great little restaurant .
service was pretty good .
hip hop sandwich shop .
not a traditional dining experience .
"food was great , and prices were very great ."
everything on menu was under $ 00 .
good quality burger and great service .
hard to compete with in-n-out prices tho .
"all these mesa , az <UNK> ."
this place is pretty cool .
"very well prepared food , great service and clean ."
great burger place with a huge menu .
no apologies from anyone .
food is extremely good .
i recommend the orange beef !
four stars for the <UNK> mi sandwiches .
"it was very good , but very spicy ."
she was highly recommended by a friend .
the lady who runs the place is very sweet .
very friendly staff / ownership and food is terrific .
very beautifully built restaurant .
"not bad , not great ."
scott is a very talented guy .
i ' ll be spreading the word to friends .
this place has good eggs benedict and great potatoes .
service has been bad during every visit .
"great oven roasted bread , and unique sandwiches ."
lacking variety ... as does his pizzeria .
my wife will eat here with me .
00 % off pho is excellent .
service is always great .
do n't judge a book by its cover .
pretty nice on the inside .
extremely hot in this place .
swamp cooler inside restaurant .
needs improvement before they reach gallo blanco status .
food was nothing better than average .
how it gets such good reviews blows my mind .
go here if you live in az . .
sat at the bar .
i should note i sat at the bar .
it got all over my suit and my skin .
our cabana boy was friggin awesome as well .
i do n't know what i was thinking .
an all-around bomb of a place .
great place with an excellent beer selection
you can not go wrong here .
sandwiches are fantastic as well .
many many beers to choose from .
what more could you want ?
"amazing favors , quality is through the roof ."
' ' a horrible joke .
would have preferred a gourmet meal at <UNK> .
this place is not bad for vegas .
they are half the price of most dentists .
essentially asking whether i could afford all the work .
but some like this one go overboard with violations .
dr . joseph <UNK> at lv <UNK> is excellent .
this place is ok but pricey .
total bill with tip was $ 00 .
nothing wrong with the gym itself .
i ' m no expert .
prices were nothing special and it had zero atmosphere .
the menu fare may be ok .
good dim sum in las vegas .
must try in north vegas .
side dishes are also good choice .
good pulled chicken and pork sandwiches .
the <UNK> pork ribs are also fantastic .
maybe just a poor cut of ribs .
would recommend to anyone .
first time in and great sandwich .
i ' ll be back next time in town .
its amazing how on pitch these guys are .
the venue sound quality needs some work .
as a dude its just awkward to go up .
another bucket list item crossed off .
definitely not up to vegas standards by any means .
this company needs to revamp its hvac system .
food took a very long time to arrive .
save on paying tips .
that ' s what i called service .
best sushi in charlotte .
"whatever you do , do n't order the chorizo ."
perhaps that is their strategy .
service leaves much to be desired .
also a decent place to watch sports on tv .
"specials are good , decent outdoor seating ."
lots of equipment and free weights .
- rrb - and popping each collar in sequence .
can you smell the money ?
sushi is generally better than <UNK> next door .
fish taco is also solid .
good prices as well .
drink list could use some work .
the garlic naan is very good .
"good upscale , trendy restaurant ."
the shrimp appetizer is excellent .
price is high but appropriate for what it is .
many good beers on tap .
good beer list and service .
"first , vinegar based ."
"no brown sugar , tomato , molasses mix here ."
"for good bbq , try mac ' s instead ."
"also , big daddy ' s offers salads ."
"excellent farmer ' s market , best in charlotte ."
"for convenience , they carry local and <UNK> items ."
best fro-yo in charlotte .
"skip catfish , pork chop and bbq ."
but also much cheaper .
"grilled peaches were not good , muscles were decent ."
usually the special is good .
taste of the mid west !
totally indifferent and uncaring .
small place but excellent food .
the food and drinks were great .
the ambience was great .
the waitress was very attentive to the party .
very eclectic and interesting food and drink choices .
the sage fried chicken was perfect .
this was a great stadium .
ca n't take the hops ?
nothing is better than the finest .
another draw back ... no hp sauce !
"soft , flavorful and very well done ."
buy some tamales ... 0 .
"well , these guys make me look pathetic ."
these pastas are what i would call <UNK> .
i am talking roll yourself home good .
- rrb - we crawled into this pub .
everyone burns a pizza ... it happens .
turkey rueben and <UNK> were both excellent .
the mussels were served in generous proportion .
please please please consider my experience before booking here .
had their pizza and it was awesome .
wife had the wedge and also very good .
this is an amazing place .
what else can you ask for ?
she did n't just try to beat the clock .
this is the place you want your massage .
they will take great care of you .
i will never use this company again unless mgmt .
overall horrible save your time and go to <UNK> .
i ' ll be brief .
we did go there awfully early though .
three words : damn good pastries .
"bobby flay , you ' re a fraud ."
i had the egg on a tortilla thing .
the flavors were n't all that interesting .
that ' s the best word to describe it .
"my wife , however , had the cobb salad ."
asked them ` ` light salt ' ' .
"so , what did they do ?"
more on that later .
couple of <UNK> : 0 .
you go there and pay for the experience .
0 bites of 00 courses will fill you up .
the cheese dip was awesome .
love the surf music soundtrack and the tiki decor .
0/0 price happy hour .
great pool tables and no $ 0 sodas .
you guys are solving problems .
food is very tasty .
the tea selection is unique .
the food was excellent .
it far exceeded our expectations .
definitely not a gourmet las vegas buffet .
average at its best .
"spend some money , have some fun ."
the beer was cold and our waitress was awesome .
. only 0 minutes from the strip .
this was comfort bar food at its best .
it ' s watered down .
the food is very good .
this is a great new restaurant .
excellent pizza and delicious chicken wings .
one of the worst experience i have ever had .
i was with a party of 00 for lunch .
i ' ll give them that .
took an hour to get my car washed .
this may well be my last visit to chino .
most overpriced sushi i ' ve had .
ca n't go wrong .
the owner will treat you as a friend .
i would certainly recommend them to others .
a good break from fast-food .
the best late night montreal has to offer .
"first , he ' s a very practical guy ."
service was very good and the food was great .
went there for lunch and had the burger .
to my surprise the half of pizza is burn !
very disappointing to the quality of this experience .
"great pool , cool dj ' s ."
do n't get fooled by anywhere else in chinatown !
be ready for an impressive wine list as well !
affordable pricing and actually an amazing service .
bare is the anti typical vegas pool experience .
a european vibe smaller venue with beautiful topless patrons !
the steaks were cooked to perfection .
i will be back time and time again .
the food was excellent .
we ate at five guys on eastern tonight .
<UNK> is the class that replaced it .
guess i better step it up .
i have n't felt this good in years .
thanks the service has changed and was awesome tonight .
please lets try to make more lanes available .
edgar quote the best price we had found .
they assured her there would be no additional cost .
by far the worst hotel in vegas .
the down side is how bad the service is .
"the food is good , way above average ."
the food is good .
my wife loves this place .
gentleman was very friendly .
0 star is too many .
everything we had was border line uneatable .
"very fresh meat , great cheese , loved it ."
the place was very clean and people friendly .
favorite mexican food in town .
the <UNK> are awesome .
"yeah , doubt i ' ll be back ."
"good food , good service , just too pricey ."
"plenty of tvs , not too loud ."
"prices are really cheap , but bad interior ."
beers is warm and live band is not good .
"we , it was excellent ."
good selection of beer and full bar .

the pool is incredible .
"beer was extremely cold , well poured drinks ."
i had two different pasta dishes that were incredible .
"pretty good pizza , not great ."
they do have a <UNK> salad that is excellent .
service is always pretty good .
"good place , not great ."
the downside was the food .
it was very average at best .
the coffee very good .
i ordered the veal parmesan which was amazing .
nice for dates and small groups .
the review is for the casino and food only .
the cafã © is fine .
"nice comfortable seating , dark and old school inside ."
. ding ... waiting ... .
all very low grade freezer junk .
i would seriously avoid this place like the plague .
or refer to sworn enemies only .
i am not sure how to rate this place .
as in money was all not the customers .
. lord knows what they do with it .
mixed experience at its ' best .
". but mainly burger , fries and hot dogs ."
"the other two , a 0 out of 00 ."
the food is pretty good .
the meatballs are excellent .
the banana nut bread is worth the trip alone .
"not super , not bad ."
this place closes early so be warned .
no chicken skewers or anything like that .
the parking is easy .
"wow , what a treat ."
over the top good .
what a real bakery is and should be .
the owners are professional and friendly .
but it is n't overpriced either .
- rrb - * * small update .
"home cooked , just right ."
i am referring to friends and family .
this place continues to be a wonderful eating establishment .
all portions were well made and generous .
pastries that are artfully and carefully done .
crispy outside to the bagels .
the mushroom soup was astounding .
the service was friendly and the ice water plentiful .
the seating for the most part is size friendly .
canned mushrooms at extra cost ?
it is good just not the best .
in our opinion we expected more nyc kick .
the pizza looked good may try one day .
ok this is better than taco bell .
overall this place is cheap convenient eats .
the seating is a pretty metallic blue .
you can eat here on the cheap .
the food itself seems very clean and fresh .
but i am betting it ' s good .
"tandoori chicken , soups , pakora ."
there was a mango dessert that was unique .
the place is really nice and deserves a shot .
this place is very big .
the pretty colors get me every time .
dinner in general is a stretch .
"the food is ok , not bad not amazing ."
the service for the most part is fine .
also nice ladies run the place .
nice cheap lunch place in a pinch .
as if no one can figure that out .
the bill was 00 bucks without tips .
ok i am not a barbecue expert at all .
"excellent ideas , and menu ."
it came to about 00 bucks .
"the desserts looked tiny , as in bite size ."
the casserole dishes needed some help .
our waitress was quite possibly straight from hell .
"the atmosphere was great , the seats are uncomfortable ."
"wow , are they serious ?"
very mediocre borderline nasty food .
the selections are mixed quality wise .
"better than many , not excellent ."
the food is very good .
. there were 0 people in our party .
apparently the chicken parmesan is the bomb .
the waitress did offer to fix the problem .
"the service good , the food ."
the clearance section is pretty big .
they accept coupons and the clerks are helpful .
if you want quality stay here .
soup is good for the most part .
even the coffee is good .
unfortunately the service here is lacking .
the meatball subs are the bomb !
a local sit down and talk kinda place .
much better than the other choices in the area .
overall most of the place is worth it .
most days there is one sale or another .
that being said perhaps it was just bad luck .
they are in need of some major <UNK> now .
"the gyros , the rice , the salad ."
"the steak was so tender , the soup addictive ."
the parking is easy and the bathrooms are convenient .
trying the soup next .
there was n't much there for the money .
in fairness some meals were not overpriced .
and you can eat for under 00.00 .
nice wait staff and good food .
the seating is nice .
everything was top notch .
give it a try .
this place is good depending on what you like .
everything is a la cart unless i missed something .
how cool is that ?
staff went out of their way to help out .
"worth a stop , bring your spending money ."
"the food is good , but not excellent ."
prices are up there unless you want something simple .
and nothing outstanding for the price either .
the pasta was exotic and different .
the clam chowder was excellent .
customer service was spotty and slow .
the food thing and actual service needs some tweaking .
on a budget it ' s worth a go .
this place usually has good service .
the chicken and veal are both good .
they carry <UNK> deli items .
"lots of produce , and frozen foods ."
"the lasagne as good , not excellent ."
the seating is comfortable .
the secret is the meat and fish .
get a surf and turf diner !
much better than their italian dishes .
the service and atmosphere are great here .
"both were good , not excellent ."
the sandwiches have cheap deli meat .
it is very loud like a school <UNK> .
but that ' s about it .
not worth travelling for unless its really your bag .
i got pancakes and my wife ordered oatmeal .
pretty simple and should have been fast .
he pulled the ticket and gave it a waitress .
but the food is well worth any wait .
all of the reviews have said it all .
"the waiter was not only attentive , but engaging ."
the service was a bit of a mixed bag .
the yellow curry is excellent .
i paid $ 0.00 for a bunch of filler .
the staff there were all outstanding .
this place is the real deal !
been here a few times before .
sarah keeps me looking good but still very stylish .
"great beer selection , and friendly staff ."
make sure to take time to eat here .
the best burger place in pittsburgh .
i went here twice during my stay .
the first visit was absolutely mindblowing .
i would certainly be skeptical of the service department .
oil has been changed from this dealer from new .
how could someone be this obnoxious ?
a great introduction to the pub scene of montreal !
this wont be a long review .
drink and app specials are great during happy hour .
"it was actually very good , just rather small ."
i hope this was just a bad experience .
"good times , friendly waitress n mgr ."
<UNK> calamari after finding sum hairs in there .
bought my martini as well .
chips and drunken bread both good times .
well for that price they should have been .
i have more than 0 0s .
appropriate <UNK> in servers .
great pitas here for a good price .
will keep going back .
"pita is awesome , everything else is ok ."
please be sure to see follow up review .
probably the worst we have had there .
looked like the printer did not work .
i wrote a pretty tough review on march 00 .
the food was excellent .
the staff was very attentive and professional .
and the night became a memorable one .
this is just a great local restaurant .
lunches are the best deal in ne phoenix .
huge menu and great looking deserts too .
"give it try , you wo n't be disappointed ."
the purple zebra is a haven for tourists .
"as expected , the prices were a bit outrageous ."
i would recommend the lengua tacos .
"decent prices , and a good vibe ."
owner comes around and asks how everything is going .
"bathrooms were clean , along with the bay ."
hold on it gets worse .
hold on it gets worse .
service was very good .
fantastic wood-fired brick oven pizza !
the pizza margherita was excellent .
"yes , premium resorts are expensive ."
the rooms are nice but not premium resort quality .
"overall experience , well below average ."
"one side allows smoking , the other does not ."
did i say way overpriced ?
"now , back to the marriott ."
i expected it to be at least six dollars .
the contrast between the two beverage experiences was <UNK> .
i would return to this marriott in a second .
you self park in a regular lot .
this is an <UNK> .
"super crowd , breakfast burrito was delicious ."
"our server brandy , was attentive but not hovering ."
this is a good place for a quick meal .
even if they ' re drinking coffee ?
we ' ve met some really cool people .
i see the owner see their dog poop .
could n't the dial corporation donate some sanitizer thingies ?
a buck to get in but 00.00 to park .
that ' s a word .
"yeah , thankfully she did n't see that ."
i like a giving spirit .
lively crowd at 00:00 am .
"comfortable bar , friendly service ."
not cheap but not over the top either .
the sushi was great .
"however , do we tip at taco bell ?"
we all know you ca n't save a taco .
los <UNK> has them beat by far .
immediately after treatment he started responding .
pauly is better than ever .
"one of them , numerous times ."
pull a tooth with no <UNK> .
i ca n't remember what it was .
i ' m like rain man .
moved into a new place last month .
there were n't magazines strewn about .
"yeah , little embarrassing ."
"she ' s extremely honest , fast , reasonable ."
two things that stand out recently .
just drunken bar <UNK> with the bartenders .
does n't get any better than this .
"go there , just do n't take my seat ."
". alright , who am i kidding ?"
because the service it outstanding .
. i ' m just sayin ' .
i managed to order without <UNK> .
the service was prompt and courteous .
what if you accidentally spilled a beer ?
"good , cheap mexican food ."
0.0 damn you los <UNK> !
for the weight loss .
i ' m a <UNK> .
i will not be visiting this location again .
the pancakes were perfect as always .
the eggs however were another story .
rustic is better than this .
biscuits with chorizo gravy ... awesome .
you have to try this place .
the best burgers ever .
i get it plain with american cheese .
that ' s all you need .
the burger melts in your mouth .
give it a try .
the food is normally pretty good .
the tuna tataki was perfectly seared and beautifully presented .
my spaghetti and meatballs was pure garbage .
being hispanic i ordered it in spanish .
the burrito came with egg and potatoes only .
christina was my server and she was great !
the food was outstanding and the service was great .
their arnold palmer was really good though .
i liked the lamb .
seriously taxis are the biggest rip off .
do n't waste your time .
maybe if you wiped my butt for me .
do n't waste your time .
"hole / crack in the sink , way ghetto ."
"tiny beds , halfway between twin and full ."
two small asians in the bed was uncomfortable .
tub / shower clogged and took forever to drain .
"cheap tv , no flat screen ."
but the carpet was better .
front door midget has a napoleon complex .
should be free for guys for once .
does n't include rio seafood or caesars .
hash browns in side were good .
both were very good .
this place is terrible .
this could be a great neighborhood spot .
you get 00/0 access to this gym .
this place is absolutely amazing .
the red curry is good not great .
. good price and good service .
i recommend coming during dinner time for more options .
this is a good old school steakhouse .
moved on to bone in ribeye medium rare .
cooked as ordered with good flavor and marbling .
this is a top steakhouse in nearly any city .
there is no reason to stay here .
not a criticism ... just a <UNK> statement .
the food was an unremarkable plate of sausages .
i could not believe how great this burger was .
i ' d pass on this place .
currently we are renting a house .
this restaurant is obnoxious .
the big hispanic dude chopping the chicken is annoying .
did i mention the food ?
the pool was n't bad .
this place is very expensive .
that pool made the store unique .
now it is nothing special .
i found the staff to be very friendly .
they kept the place relatively safe .
the down side : the rooms suck .
the couch was a pos .
and the iced tea tasted rotten .
want real nachos at a decent price ?
the water tasted like dirty city tap water .
finally i manned up and made an appointment .
i required three visits to get my teeth clean .
i highly recommend desert springs dental care to everyone .
what a pain in the @user $ $ .
the airport is confusing as hell .
' ' i said screw it .
good luck with that .
they acted as if they could n't care less .
the food is awesome as well .
the service is awesome as well .
lives up to the hype .
their parking lot kind of sucks though .
what a joke of an establishment .
best mexican food we have had in las vegas .
. bar none - great all around .
. as well grade a sushi perfection
00 more minutes our dinner arrived .
my wife would n't eat until my rack arrived .
my wife ordered the lasagna .
the rest of the day our stomachs were turning .
the casino was much larger than i thought .
the pool area was very clean and well kept .
good food and plenty of it .
beer is cold and margaritas are big .
if you go here book through mgm grand .
i visited 0 of them .
the sausage in it was delicious as well .
stunningly good and authentic indian food .
"burgr is a solid , high-quality burger ."
the tuna nachos appetizer was also great .
the cheddar waffles with bourbon syrup are great .
i can not recommend this more highly .
"cool concept with nice , personalized pizzas ."
our room was adequate .
at least you ' ll sleep at night .
toughest place to rate .
place was a blast .
split a burger and have a blast .
can i give negative stars ?
do not eat here .
"it was bland , tasteless , and cold ."
"i told the waitress twice , this is unreal ."
"check it out , you wo n't be disappointed ."
better be on your way to island <UNK> !
food wise : surprisingly good .
the curry wonton is awesome .
the pho ' s broth surprised me .
"anyway , food quality has tanked as well ."
best deal in america right here .
the meat has a really high quality taste .
cool <UNK> vibe inside .
the food here is bomb !
the chicken tenders are homemade and are seriously amazing .
big burrito for really reasonable price !
get the jalapeno <UNK> stuff .
portions so big we could care less about desserts .
overpriced for what they offer .
average prices for below average food .
we had the catfish dinner .
their food is excellent as is their service .
the ribs were dry and clearly overdone .
high prices for sub-standard <UNK> .
"additionally service was prompt , quick and courteous ."
but very highly recommend .
basic burger and onion rings were good not great .
checked into hotel and searched yelp for nearby restaurant .
looked at menu and many items crossed out .
finally ordered lamb shank and falafel .
food turned out to be quite good .
the coffee comes in little french presses !
the mediterranean restaurant was decent for breakfast .
better choice than carl jr . .
"service was fast , and portions were massive ."
the pizza ' s here are fantastic .
great table show from the chef .
"foodwise , is outstanding ."
nothing below $ 0 really .
craps is usually $ 00 .
wifi is worked into your resort fee .
and it ' s easy to guess why .
great beer and better service .
miss dee was sweetheart .
the brisket loaded potato was great .
made for some good eating .
and the mexican offerings that night were no bueno .
"it was n't gourmet , but it was familiar ."
for me the value just was n't there .
and the very same soft serve ice cream machine .
at this china star it ' s not much .
trust me you do n't want to .
things tasted rubbery and lackluster .
but this china star over here on charleston ?
it is a bit dirtier than i can accept .
it was a small portion of ramen .
tiny portions was a minus .
another great place to get some ono local food !
"they also do burgers , and spam musubi too ."
"for breakfast , they got you covered !"
"eggs with portuguese sausage or spam , and rice ?"
"well , that ' s what i hear anyway ."
"attentive , kind , and pretty on point ."
"it was ok , nothing special to me ."
i tried the shoyu ramen that night .
the broth was rather bland for my tastes .
or maybe even a dash of msg ?
pay to wash my car ?
this place is almost constantly busy .
of course there will be some unsatisfied folks .
do n't like the work they did ?
have them wipe it over .
have them wipe it over .
some of the most competitive prices in town .
all walks of life .
we employ multiple orders of this whenever we go .
i like em all .
<UNK> is close to da ' mountains !
back to the food .
<UNK> was pretty ono !
for them they deserve great props .
"sorry black eyed peas , it ai n't here ."
"it <UNK> , then dies ."
then dies again for dramatic effect .
even more if you like beef ?
expensive for what you get .
wife ' s bbq mix plate ?
"too little food , and not flavored correctly ."
small serving that left her hungry .
the kid ' s cheeseburger ?
"some up here , some down there ."
about a 0â 0/0 stars .
"really , ` ` come here often ?"
' ' is a pickup line ?
there ' s a few other specials as well .
reason why my rating might seem a bit low ?
it just ends up tasting ok .
"as an idea , the park is awesome ."
but the execution ... whew ... hit and miss .
"respect people , always ."
can this park be any more cramped ?
a comic book store maybe ?
you might be <UNK> .
free is the motivation here .
mind boggling to say the least .
white like olivia <UNK> in the winter .
please check my pic for proof of this travesty .
this thing was lifeless !
items were new on the shelves and fully stocked .
many of the items here are priced great .
prices are in line with many competitors nearby .
i do like me a good sandwich .
your selections can be from anything on the menu .
not bad for a healthy lunch !
maybe a ciabatta or a french roll ?
0â 0/0 stars to be more precise .
"not bad , but not standout great ."
but perhaps this is my fault .
the waffles stuffed with whole strips of bacon ?
it really just struck me as an average burger .
"however , the fries were crisp and delicious ."
"she had some mad strong <UNK> too , defined !"
as long as the food is good .
"omelets , damn they are pretty good in size ."
some good <UNK> ' !
"bright , briny , and peppery ."
sandwich platter of epic proportions !
this platter comes in at under $ 00 !
do n't be a friggin ' <UNK> !
nothing my gut ca n't handle though .
"for some good eats , thai this place !"
"ok , ok , bad pun ."
i give it a solid 0â 0/0 stars .
off to viva las arepas we were !
lots of folks going in and out .
one long styrofoam container .
hmmm ... am i missing an arepa ?
a couple of them were smaller .
noodles were cooked well and meats were good .
still gon na stay at 0â 0/0 stars .
"exceptional fried rice , made very well and fresh ."
the pile of fried rice was pretty small .
they were n't jumbo shrimp either .
this was no exception .
this could barely feed one average sized person .
are we in a shrimp crisis ?
just did n't meet any of my expectations .
"no curry , that ' s <UNK> ."
real close to the centennial area .
"in summary , the food is ok ."
this place borders more on the gourmet side .
great for an end to your dining .
"upon entering , the restaurant is fairly small ."
"you know , just to lighten the meaty mood ."
much bigger portion of meat than carb .
good thing there was four of us to share .
the carne asada burrito was n't skimpy either .
prices are reasonable as well .
along with some <UNK> .
"i get it , responsibility ."
but the ordering process is very much the same .
this is where much of the similarities end .
the food itself at both places is vastly different .
"chips and guacamole were great , very fresh ."
pink box is busiest during the early morning hours .
just look for the big pink sign !
for some reason it just seems fitting .
horchata can be had to your refill hearts content .
that ' s not a bad choice either .
staying at red rock has a lot of amenities .
got ta have that for these hot vegas days .
<UNK> ' in the gut only helps so much !
"ok , fine , i ' m cheap ."
nice <UNK> marketing ploy for roberto ' s !
so please handle with some restraint .
or get an extra order of chips .
"oily for sure , but damn good ."
"well , relatively speaking ."
"yes , their tongue is very good indeed ."
"oh well , no risk , no reward right ?"
"necessary condiments of chili sauce , and hoisin !"
was actually a very good bowl of pho .
the wifey and i were both quite content .
about a 0-0 inch sub .
yes folks i said it .
"supple , yet firm , makes their burgers tasty !"
i ' d give it a whirl .
back to my plain all-american cheeseburgers ?
menus are all done up in this color scheme .
"save some money , right ?"
call the care bear police !
but i did get a dirty look or two .
wifey said her fried tilapia plate was tasty .
see a theme here ?
they even tasted good after dipping them in ketchup !
"who eats here , <UNK> <UNK> ?"
<UNK> burgers is located inside in a small area .
"easily , our patties were all overcooked and lifeless ."
but still overall the burger was dry .
fries were ok though .
"thin , salty , but not quite cooked enough ."
but the taste was good .
shakes were pretty mediocre .
was a good effort <UNK> burgers .
the quick & the dead .
"luckily , what i came for they still had ."
these folks are definitely from hawaii .
island style serves some killer meat jun . .
island style cooked mine just right .
and the choices are numerous .
that ' s some good eats !
such a good start to a meal .
oh ... and korean !
"cordial , pleasant , upbeat , and courteous ."
these were good as well .
wifey chose : 0 .
nice presentation on a wood paddle .
house sauce was akin to a 0000 - island .
perfect with their housemade ketchup .
but there is quality there and lots of potential .
keep up the good work !
their big attraction is their salsa bar though .
both go with your food quite well .
their breakfast burritos are killer !
very good for the price .
this place is ` ` <UNK> ' da <UNK> !
you got ta come to island flavor !
the chicken katsu loco moco was a big <UNK> .
definitely not a calorie or cholesterol counter .
no good on that one .
our fatty mexican food was pretty much on point .
no filler on this one .
toy shack is kid central .
at toy shack it does .
want <UNK> past and present ?
want the latest in marvel and dc ?
looking for vintage star wars stuff ?
as well you authentic italy italians should .
"but , it ai n't all that bad ."
whoever started this trend <UNK> on making some bank .
is it the italian deco ?
consider date night with my wife sold .
it ' s got ta be al dente .
extra grated <UNK> cheese in my bowl ?
"olive garden , that ' s who ."
overall i usually do ok at olive garden .
put some hair on that damn chest of yours !
"some chinese , some filipino ... all chow king ."
it suits the american palette quite nicely .
"for me , this will do in a pinch ."
it ' s not like a regular pizza joint .
totally adds to the taste and texture .
nothing that ca n't be adjusted .
this review is mainly for my sandwich .
dry as a <UNK> pad !
it was a good sandwich .
selling coke products in itself is reward for me !
i need one of these things in my house .
definitely gives off a sports bar vibe .
"eat some wings , watch some football !"
yeah i just stick with the classic .
original hot wings with a dip of bleu cheese ?
everyone can be happy .
go dunk your donuts somewhere else .
or if you ' re loaded like steve wynn .
"geez , that guy is rich ."
' ' spoken like a true champ .
she loves her rare beef !
quite a number of dishes .
and perhaps a fortune cookie too .
"but dd , not fresh out of the oil ?"
it ' s kind of a wash .
blame the economy i suppose .
pretty standard buffet fare .
"really , nothing extra special here ."
"other than that , the food here is average ."
is this upscale mexican food ?
burrito al pastor was really lackluster .
"al pastor , rice , beans , some cheese ."
better be damn good !
filled with bland cheese .
then put on the grill to brown .
how hard can it be to make this ?
"hell , del taco makes a better cheese quesadilla ."
nachos should have cheese !
and for damn near $ 00 ?
"<UNK> , <UNK> ... update your prices amigos !"
"nice atmosphere , very cozy ."
forget it famous dave .
and i have no problem with that .
then <UNK> going to have a problem .
"yeah , i ' ll show you hunger games !"
choose seafood for $ 0.00 .
keep it all good in the hood .
0â 0/0 stars to be sure .
tub of mayonnaise in case i want a sandwich ?
i ended up trying a scoop of each .
and a slice of their combo pizza .
short walk but no big deal .
got ta give it a 0â 0/0 stars .
after ordering some drinks we <UNK> what to try .
nice looking plates with little fuss .
still 0â 0/0 stars .
but a very good effort on a french dip .
want some thai food with a little kick ?
"until then <UNK> thai cafã © , <UNK> !"
"' ' thanks guys , much appreciated ."
"' ' really , really ridiculous ."
acura tl type s is nowhere to be seen .
dude looks up the car .
acura tl type s .
this thing was in poop condition .
' ' nice try with the tricks .
"tell him , ` ` nah ."
` ` i hardly ever buy a car .
. and your place is still packed !
"best for us , no <UNK> nicks !"
mike & crew at <UNK> are the best around !
work on vehicles is excellent !
tell mike chris sent you !
how can it get much better ?
"i know , it is greatly abused by some ."
costco helps me <UNK> my tech <UNK> .
"<UNK> , more surround <UNK> !"
but no matter i guess .
need a quick deli fix ?
"yes , it is akin to a french dip ."
hopefully sooner than later .
but with more hawaii flavor infused into the menu .
i ' m a big boy !
i can understand how food costs rise constantly .
<UNK> ... this stuff is like crack !
"well , at least i do ."
this was seriously some great pie !
what else was great ?
picked up on that to save some dollars !
i had to deduct one star .
just make sure they help me clean next time .
nice flooring and high ceilings too .
not a bad deal at all .
definitely reminds you of a cheesecake factory type joint .
loaded with good toppings .
after two slices i was done !
the surprise of the night was the pork ribs !
i finished half the rack myself .
with that coupon our meal was a near steal .
yeah you ' re gon na want one .
that looks like some good eats for cheap !
"what happened to the seafood extravaganza , station casinos ?"
plus i might have had a malt to go .
just wo n't cut it .
a couple bucks right there !
a surprising win-win flavor punch to the culinary gut !
also special new hot dog concoctions .
one great thing about basil <UNK> is the prices .
"really , it is pretty good ."
watch your spiciness level !
cheap on the cheap !
go for the pepper steak or the panang curry .
it ' s just very lackluster .
nothing about this place screams gourmet .
lots of canned stuff .
what ... no gelato ?
only soft serve available and it was no bueno .
it needs some serious help .
bordering near 0 stars .
maybe all the stops are pulled out for dinner ?
we approached the buffet line with a small crowd .
"after the dust settled , what do i see ?"
a typical looking buffet ?
the heaps of praise ?
the condiments on top did n't really save it .
the hand rolls offered ?
"but again , we were severely disappointed ."
so i skipped that .
left the dessert room very sad .
the service was downright lackluster .
the appetizers were bland .
these suckers were huge sheets !
and new york style .
it ' s really tough to rate this place .
i usually go during lunch .
even lunch on saturday is still weekday prices .
i was born in georgia ... go coke !
"oh yeah , one last tip ."
or maybe i added way too much ginger ?
got ta love being comped !
i liken it to a fancier vegas buffet .
"awesome food , awesome service , awesome experience ."
do n't come here if you absolutely hate kiss !
kiss mini golf is probably best played at night .
probably like how all rock stars live .
thrilling to say the least .
not half bad for only $ 0.00 .
this place is all aces !
eatin ' wealthy on the cheap !
the quality of the food is never lacking here .
that fusion sauce is killer !
it does get kind of ridiculous .
for what it was it was pretty good .
decent food for decent prices .
each meal was served with <UNK> fries .
no quarter pounder here ?
good greek food right off of charleston near summerlin .
dang did that make me feel poor .
nice little family run place .
and what they know is pretty darn tasty .
overall the plate was good .
overall a decent plate .
servings were generous though .
i ' ll be back .
eating = 000x better than gambling .
that in itself is a battle .
and what is up with the asian station ?
that is crucial for a great burger !
no knock on her for being super busy .
wallet friendly for sure .
breaking even can sometimes be the greatest thing .
that place rocked with props !
even back then i remember feeling ripped off .
it ' s probably one of their better deals .
"holy cow , does paul <UNK> eat here ?"
i ' m a big boy myself .
this platter alone will feed 0 easily .
this sandwich comes out stacked !
but still good with some vanilla ice cream .
"but try claim jumper , you will like it !"
"you got the local hawaii , <UNK> feel ."
the hawaiian ` chipotle ' theme reigns as well .
"i like it , food my way ."
good enough for a hungry local boy .
burrito is still in excellent taste .
it made your burritos killer !
i give it a 0â 0/0 stars .
<UNK> ordering at chipotle .
"regular , jalapeno , and chipotle tabasco sauces ?"
"and yet , this place is full of people ."
on to the food .
i wanted my kim chee fried rice !
most times i end up at sonic !
"god , i am such a glutton ."
wifey did not really enjoy her kalbi soup .
"she was thinking , ` ` kalbi ?"
this soup by itself was just blah .
like all-you-can-eat crab legs long .
but we managed to make due .
they even have bleu cheese crumbles !
the main event at golden corral is good .
but at least your sesame chicken dish was decent .
"hence , the 0 - star rating ."
welcome to the buffet capital of the west !
there was football on the tv !
women in tight tops !
why not a sample ?
but not the case here .
"oh well , price of doing business i suppose ."
nacho average burger nachos were good .
"pleasant guy , thanked us for coming in ."
"also , maybe up the serving a tad ?"
but still not bad for $ 00.00 per person .
went on a sunday for lunch .
this buffet brings back lots of memories .
more on this later .
dinner items start rolling out at around 0:00 pm .
the mashed potatoes were pretty bad .
how do you mess that up ?
where ' s the beef ?
not world class at all .
and those guys know how to make it correct .
it is worth it for the buffet price alone .
wow ... 0st to review !
"' ' ha ha doc , hilarious ."
"good people , good service , reasonable prices ."
still some good chicken fingers !
sura bbq is meaty overload !
ruth chris steakhouse this is not .
"no , no , no ."
like you bbq ' d !
only thing not on the all-you-can-eat ?
only one you say ?
"yep , and i have no problem with that ."
i ca n't recall right now .
i give it a 0â 0/0 stars .
be respectful and tell <UNK> ` <UNK> ' .
do the buffet folks !
"' ' no bro , i am not ."
tip top running condition .
take a cue from costco for better cheap eats .
for only $ 0 each ?
and wrapping it in yellow paper ?
ooh ... almost authentic mexican !
"when these tacos are fresh , they are greatness ."
"i will eat like a cheap , happy man ."
i can eat a dozen of these easy .
not bad as they are a standard crinkle cut .
"you will either love these , or hate these ."
del taco will treat you right .
"but damn , the taste was just ... off ."
but their seasoning make them tasty as all heck .
"granted the sucker was large , loaded !"
tomato was ok but could have been cut smaller .
so put that in your food knowledge book .
damn well better know you may get sick .
i eat quite a few of these .
like crack in a bowl .
it is a welcome addition .
"some are good , some are not so good ."
not bad for a sushi buffet .
you can eat hearty for a measly <UNK> .
the world is your oyster .
flavor city my friends .
so they taste pretty damn good !
but ketchup will do as well .
i love a good cup of frozen yogurt .
so i like the <UNK> and the organization .
"yeah , watch your kids !"
just look at my check-ins for this place .
a good time can be had for little cost .
those are very ono .
their food usually fits the bill pretty good .
it is a good time .
"food quality is good , dishes are ono !"
almost as good as back home in hawaii .
you keep cookin ' without that wok <UNK> !
the food is where it matters most .
they eat at ohana hawaiian bbq all the time .
"entering the place , it is nice enough ."
there was one other couple ordering at the time .
"yay , some life out of this guy ."
"good effort , but wish it was more original ."
our pound of fried fish seemed so measly !
heaven this is not .
solid 0â 0/0 stars !
perfect time for tofu hut late night special !
that stuff was bomb !
"guys , please get some better vents !"
i am an addict .
oxtail is what you think it is .
the tail of the ox .
back to oxtail at the feast buffet .
i am a beast .
and majority of the food is average .
wan na ring in 0000 right for cheap eats ?
"yep , asian section ."
"yep , this feast buffet has got it ."
prime rib on the rare ?
wedge salad with blue cheese ?
"look , the economy today just sucks ."
got relatives coming to town ?
got champagne tastes on a beer budget ?
and you ' re expected to foot the bill ?
look like high roller stud .
you can thank me later .
garlic knots that is .
this place is popular for the quick lunch crowd !
one of the house specialties .
good crust with fresh sauce and good quality cheese .
service is quick and friendly .
and the prices are on the cheap !
a very good helping of it .
the kick from the chili powder was most welcome .
"interesting , but not typically my type of crowd ."
no gun show tonight !
<UNK> you have become the <UNK> of my existence .
the big surprise was the fresh made potato chips !
the wifey ' s philly cheese steak was ok .
the parking lot for the hush puppy is huge !
even better i suppose ?
the hush puppy was overall pretty reasonable .
"yeah , screw you mcdonald ' s ."
wow ... what luck !
the one back on maryland pkwy .
a burger at a mexican place ?
i prefer their burgers over mcdonald ' s .
0â 0/0 stars ... nearly a 0 !
<UNK> ... breathe in the wealth !
wifey liked her santa cruz skillet very much .
all that with egg yolk running down ?
so the muffin was somewhat forgettable .
this <UNK> is also fully equipped with a bar !
"totally gnarly , dude ! ! thanks groupon !"
the buffet is truly massive .
quality standards are above buffets of lower caliber .
cost me a cool $ 00 !
"that ' s like , epic , right ?"
i ' m more of an action figure fan .
the programming i attended was great as well .
that made it much friendlier on the wallet .
vips got a black & white sketch version .
i ' ll be there .
not to mention the diet .
"that said , they do serve some decent dishes ."
but add on their <UNK> to the menu .
"what , not asian enough for you ?"
about $ 0 for a large one .
although he does creep me out a bit .
the popcorn selection here is astounding !
the prices are a tad on the high side .
others are totally lost on the concept .
why is there chili on everything ?
the chili is what sets them apart .
same at tommy ' s .
by itself the chili is just ok .
hot dog with chili .
breakfast burrito with chili .
it adds some substance to an already greasy meal !
will stick to your ribs !
be prepared to hit the throne .
<UNK> yourself into the chili concept gradually .
guess that ' s what we get for artisanal .
"ha ha , i kid ... but seriously ."
on to the food .
verdict came back as pretty good .
it is for sure fancy mexican / latin food .
the premier tequila at mundo is alien tequila .
"catering to the mayor , right !"
or pitbull with his entourage !
that ' s more my crowd .
i ' ll give it a 0â 0/0 stars .
asian stuff in the back .
"for appetizers , some fried chicken wings ."
with sides of hot sauce and ranch .
we almost finished these off .
cooked medium rare just like i asked .
but it did n't taste bad .
nothing over the top outstanding .
service was quick and friendly .
we had the choice of either an 0 oz .
"filet mignon , 00 oz ."
"ribeye , or the salmon ."
medium rare ribeye was in !
cut into it ... damn !
that ribeye was <UNK> !
i was treated to a large serving of guilt .
fattening lunch to say the least .
comics and all things nerdy ?
need the latest issue of walking dead ?
limited edition of the <UNK> <UNK> ?
walking dead ' s <UNK> with motorcycle action figure ?
ca n't get much better than that .
crew at maximum comics is on point as well .
"nothing was soggy , and nothing was dry looking ."
hidden gem for some <UNK> take-out .
0â 0/0 stars to be more precise .
excellent with a brew to wash it down .
and people buy it .
i get a hint of ketchup and possibly relish .
you will not regret it .
no convention goes without a hitch !
stan ` the man ' lee !
this was bound to draw some crowds .
all there were true artists to the comic form .
$ 00 for a stan lee signature ?
still a top con show in the vegas valley !
i got to see fan favorite george lopez !
<UNK> ace creator rob <UNK> was on hand too !
and these folks were friendly as ever .
"<UNK> prop <UNK> , anyone ?"
both captain kirk and captain <UNK> on one stage !
"really great , great conversation ."
"i will be back again , star trek convention !"
"lots of miss , but a few bright spots ."
and folks sure looked like they were .
it was actually quite good .
damn markup must be massive !
poorly executed for the most part .
let me get on with the brio burger .
$ 0 for this ?
and this brio burger was plated funny too .
"the burger , no lettuce , no tomato ?"
and maybe a peroni .
misti <UNK> ' the big lv !
my appreciation for the medium has increased <UNK> .
"and yes , comic books are an art form !"
i like a decent reuben sandwich .
i get one without fail .
"eat on my friends , eat on ."
i am a fan of nyc thin-crust pizza .
that place makes an excellent pie .
my guess is to keep the costs down .
just need some improvement on the ny eats .
maybe it was in the execution ?
it just was n't that great to me .
- the egg rolls were pretty basic .
possibly store bought and just fried .
- the beef broccoli was average .
- main saving grace was the chicken fried rice .
you guys need to step it up !
every once is a while anyway .
- rrb - little burger always comes out stacked !
just like all the other five guys .
"not too shabby , abby !"
"kinda like a secret menu item , eh ?"
pizza and beer ... winning !
a big plus ... the place is mucho clean !
a really nice touch .
cheap and good eats is a must i say !
then wash it all down with a mexican coca-cola !
arriba en el <UNK> !
stop reading and check this place out already !
you will get a look of confusion .
really makes a difference in your mexican dishes .
<UNK> bakery goes all day long .
$ 0 sale for a burrito al pastor ?
"cheap and easy , that ' s my motto ."
<UNK> fits that nicely .
all you can eat baby !
some decent ` que on my side of town !
i do n't see why not .
combos come with your choice of meats and sides .
but you ca n't have everything .
"also , get some extra bbq sauce !"
i enjoy the hot links sandwich in particular .
short & sweet today folks !
you like free roasted peanuts ?
"bad economy - 0 , you - 0 ."
no inspiration with the cooking .
a real let down .
pasta cucina is a <UNK> .
finding a 00 inch tire is hard <UNK> !
off it was to costco .
"the famed michelin <UNK> , their newest high-end tire ."
i told costco i would think about it .
"other tires were out , michelin was in ."
"but , now it came down to brass <UNK> ."
i was prepared to say no .
i was on the fence .
but this one from lucille ' s ?
not on par at all .
i had one and they were good .
where are the ends of my ribs ?
i felt ripped off to say the least .
what the hell are they ?
<UNK> ' all the birds with one stone .
<UNK> ' s <UNK> 0 video game ?
but back to the food .
one day i will win that damn big prize !
"really , it is kinda hidden ."
"a nice sized portion , big looking sandwich ."
add some tabasco and it was some good eats .
"food is ok , value , not the greatest ."
those ribs were tasty !
the shrimp were great as well with that aioli .
hachi as a restaurant ?
fast forward to now .
this shiny new buffet had mostly <UNK> food .
built up my yelp street cred with those reviews !
disappointing to say the least .
it is probably not worth my time .
"genius , i tell you , genius ."
"' ' i am a bad , bad dad ."
0â 0/0 stars to their credit .
"stainless steel , bold colors , very pleasing ."
"burgers and custard are health foods , right ?"
restaurant itself is quaint but nice and newly painted .
service though was spot on comforting .
"ah , the perks of being a yelper ."
hope it stays around for a while .
after two little bites one wing was gone .
where is the butter for this ?
just damn basic sweet chili sauce on wings .
the boneless wings were dry .
i give it a 0â 0/0 stars .
"just a long , drawn out <UNK> ."
"district one was hoppin ' , no joke there ."
we started off with the tamarind wings .
at $ 0 a piece damn were they small .
but again ... what ' s with the portion ?
the service for us was excellent .
"save some money , watch some <UNK> you know ?"
nor was my pizza ever made that bad .
i did not order thin crust folks !
my gf did too .
i give it a 0â 0/0 stars .
all have their merits .
"for me , smashburger ends up being just average ."
<UNK> as long as you know what you want .
but the burger is n't that bad at all .
actually not a bad deal .
not many buffets in vegas serve beef ribs .
try em ' all !
only in vegas baby !
but were virtually tasteless .
at least lulu hawaiian bbq got this mostly right .
"oh yeah , eat that sucker up !"
is this your chinese kicking in ?
back on to the food .
that is my major gripe here .
i love me some supple buns !
located in the golden nugget near the hotel registration .
"good quality olive oil , fresh beans ."
but the flavor was wow !
"prime rib was juicy , oozing with fatty flavor !"
did i mention the extensive use of butter ?
"nah , just kidding ."
save me some prime rib .
"and wow , was i in for a <UNK> !"
i found like a half a dozen of em !
the lettuce provided some ` snap ' .
i finished it ... barely .
no wonder i slept like a baby afterwards .
you wo n't regret it .
"bad , bad sign ."
my <UNK> persisted as i ventured into the menu .
she chose a side of onion rings .
this salad bar was n't half bad either .
all the produce was fresh and crisp .
not too impressed ruby tuesday .
it hits a pretty good spot .
penguins that have happy feet ?
i love me some subway $ 0 foot <UNK> !
"yeah , sign me up ."
"and believe me , we ate like kings !"
buffets fill that perfect medium .
this feast buffet even offers shakes & malts !
why go to a buffet expecting michelin star food ?
the over crunch made the dish texture somewhat off .
no extra stars for this wannabe mini bar concept .
burger and a beer ?
i look at the menu boards .
all friggin ' domestic .
a ` whopper ' of $ 0 !
nine friggin ' dollars !
which is not saying too much .
have you eaten yet ?
boy was that a mistake !
on to checking out the babycakes cafe menu .
lots of familiar breakfast choices .
but damn ... those red velvet babycakes ?
the king of meats in hawaii !
breakfast nirvana i say !
i mean that in the nicest way .
famous dave ' s interior is really ... decorated .
but the place was inviting nonetheless .
of course at <UNK> this is usually the norm .
loosen those slots and tables !
thankfully it did n't cost me any more money .
my thai chicken pizza looked excellent !
basically just another place to get a bite .
<UNK> ' s serving some hawaiian delicacies ?
my fried egg was overcooked as well !
pretty bland and not much of it .
should have done it this time around !
an honest 0â 0/0 stars .
"hell , some folks even love boiled ribs !"
but for bbq it ' s not my favorite .
but still good for what it is .
the star of the show was the hot link .
"spicy , good flavor , and good texture ."
delicious on the hot link sandwich .
what the hell does n't cause cancer ?
did n't use pork bones from a kurobuta pig ?
no green onion from the hokkaido <UNK> ?
wifey got the deluxe sora miso ramen .
wifey only managed to finish about half her bowl .
cooked just right and not soggy .
"that stuff was killer , on point !"
great on a cold winter day .
like maybe 0-0 tables at the most .
sorry all you top gun lovers out there .
on a fresh tortilla .
but damn is it tasty !
what ' s going on ?
"upon opening , the sandwich was very average ."
what happened to the jalapenos ?
overall just an ok sandwich .
for the price i would have expected more ingredients .
i figure why not give it a shot .
pretty good french roll .
now this place is a staple for me .
"you want some good , authentic filipino food ?"
talk about enjoying your culture !
i can give it a 0â 0/0 stars easy .
$ 00 for a friggin ' breakfast sandwich !
all you need for a growing middle-aged man !
breakfast just got big <UNK> ' !
"yeah , 0 for 0 !"
another one of my favs is the spicy italian .
one of the coolest things about this subway ?
it gets a meh from me .
the wifey wanted to try it out .
mind boggling i tell you .
no wonder red lobster stays in business .
"not the greatest combination , ha ha !"
these actually were pretty good .
chain like red lobster ?
"really , a borderline 0 for this place ."
"decor is nice , dark , lots of brick ."
at $ 0 for a 00 oz .
chicago ' s master brewer ... is a filipino !
nothing was really all that special .
my fries on the other hand were very good .
"the food though , might need some improvement ."
plus a star though for their filipino master brewer !
when has a free steak ever turned me down ?
"ah , the memories ."
now i ' m a poor 00 year old .
the big surprise here is the chinese food .
"and <UNK> , the food is exceptional !"
these guys were top notch .
rare to find in dives like this .
good way to end the meal .
food here is great for a chain restaurant .
about a 0â 0/0 star for their bahn mi .
mr . sandwich makes a decent bahn mi .
a bit of a no-no .
so expect a lot of in-and-out foot traffic .
food was well priced to boot .
like filipino food from the <UNK> ?
soft drink and tax already included !
these folks need a push from some social media .
who gets rid of newborn puppies !
this pup is a fighter !
need a dent fixed on your ride ?
one on my hood .
<UNK> the dents and gave me the low down .
no trace of them at all from any angle .
no more <UNK> of a dent on my ride !
nice change of pace from the robots at audi .
no more steering problems !
that baby served me well for seven years .
price was reasonable - check .
<UNK> 0 owner - check .
listing has low miles - check .
this is where it almost goes to <UNK> .
but rear floor mats are missing .
that may be an error on the site .
then i ask to test drive it .
more attitude from eric .
know your cars dude .
"moron , you just lost a sale ."
"crap , i ' m there ."
this went on for another 0 0/0 hours .
they even washed wifey ' s <UNK> for free !
close ... but no cigar .
going to the food .
for fast foods standards it ' s ok .
jollibee ' s menu is all over the place !
it all tastes strangely the same .
thanks for the memories .
sure beats a friggin ' egg mcmuffin !
overall it ' s an ok experience .
ok well maybe some of us eat like that .
now that ' s <UNK> !
0â 0/0 stars to be more precise .
"wow makino , what has happened to you lately ?"
no plans to exceed expectations ?
your standard mcdonald ' s <UNK> grub .
looks like just about any other <UNK> building one .
"those newer , more modern looking mcdonald ' s ?"
the grill is short on customer service .
waited 00 minutes with no response from anyone working !
no mayo or mustard or ketchup on top .
"<UNK> © red rock , <UNK> © ."
we are in las vegas after all .
lets start with our cold stone flavor creator .
no big deal i say .
here ' s where it gets silly .
' ' holy $ h !
have you even eaten cold stone ice cream ?
utter and total disappointment .
"i know , i should have been listening better ."
. ' that baby came to the table sizzling .
maybe next free power lunch !
i <UNK> it all up .
fatty <UNK> was in the house .
food coma in the making .
i ' ll give it a 0â 0/0 stars .
it fits the bill right in the middle !
for what it is the place works great .
although it is a bit greasy it tastes great !
"pei wei takes money from everyone , folks !"
my biggest vice here though ?
<UNK> ' da mouth !
comfort food for me at it ' s finest .
just about as good as the rest .
was just part of the trip .
who knew fish could swim to the desert ?
what is going on ?
where is the sand ?
well we do have sand .
it truly makes a difference .
not a bad combo for around $ 0 .
so the damn fish better be good .
breakfast and lunch items galore !
nothing in short supply .
all in all a great breakfast for me .
wifey also opted for two buttermilk <UNK> pancakes .
this plate was made for a king !
this beats ihop and denny ' s any day .
their burgers are humongous as well .
"people were nice and courteous , but also quick ."
good quality and value for the dollar .
i give it a 0â 0/0 stars .
clean and tidy for the most part .
then another slice of bacon .
and some lettuce and tomato for good measure .
overall a decent sandwich .
best part about mega tom ' s burgers ?
cheap eats for the masses !
that place is hardcore .
fast and efficient as a <UNK> .
really nothing of greatness at this mcdonald ' s .
got ta make up for all those lost wages !
this egg white creation is pretty tasty .
but at the regular price of almost $ 0 ?
there ' s nothing like it .
no chicken fingers or intricate pasta dishes here .
not bad for a non-traditional pizza .
ok for a date night .
wait ... wrong chain .
"folks must like their <UNK> music , eh ?"
fortunately a lot of it sounded tasty .
for the most part she enjoyed it .
"honda enthusiasts , i like it ."
wasted away ... in margaritaville .
in the middle of the desert .
"mr . buffett , you have no shame !"
you and kenny <UNK> doing a <UNK> anytime soon ?
margaritaville was quite the experience .
a kid ' s got ta eat .
"ooo , palm trees !"
then all the questions .
really on the average side .
rest of the food there ?
$ 00 for coconut shrimp ?
not much different fare than your local chain restaurant .
but the drinks do look tasty .
theme restaurant ... check !
menu was nice and simple .
these came out in short order .
very good starter for the meal to come .
about as good as guacamole can get .
"but no biggie , the burrito was good ."
my only gripe of why not the fourth star ?
it was a near no-brainer .
it was spicy though because of the chili pepper .
but overall still a nice entrã © e .
big plus here for me ?
it is the bomb <UNK> !
island auto ' s price rates are excellent !
he will get the job done right .
"still 0 star service , baby !"
yeah no thanks guy .
no more moaning from my power steering !
no pain no gain !
i do n't need no stinkin ' belt !
- rrb - - lobster bisque all were great !
! save that dough ... eat some meat !
"yeah , that guy ."
no deep dish for you !
but this place is considered vegetarian heaven .
addictive with hot mustard .
skinny and not much flavor .
these guys and their speed over quality sometimes .
have you ever seen <UNK> <UNK> on tv cooking ?
it can get hard as a rock .
it was reasonably priced too at about $ 00 .
sauce was good to sop up with the bread .
so many locals i tell you .
it can be hard to find seating .
keep some of that dough for the slot machines !
overall the gyro was pretty tasty .
"yes , folks i do it all ."
<UNK> lies the problem .
it just seems ... cheap .
and that ' s the point with walmart .
the cheaper the better .
and if their price does n't beat the competition ?
talk about trying to start a monopoly .
another gripe i have with this walmart ?
the lack of a decent asian grocery section .
<UNK> ... ' ' geez dude .
but they do a pretty good job at it .
do n't like fried chicken ?
"here , eat these chicken fingers !"
perhaps a hint of <UNK> ?
just make sure they ' re good tasting pickles .
do n't cheap out !
top with 0-0 chicken fingers .
place slice on top of fingers .
i would have rated them a 0 then .
they have the best steak around bar none !
very good appetizers and pizza .
excellent place to call home in pittsburgh .
this place is going to get better and better .
this is the place to stay in montreal .
<UNK> was custom made for this property .
<UNK> <UNK> lighting is found in the lobby .
wine list features very affordable ontario wines .
one ca n't go wrong dining / drinking here .
service was polite with friendly staff .
"all in all , a reliable spot to dine ."
"waiters , waitresses <UNK> about ."
ca n't go wrong dining here .
a modern american bistro of note in pittsburgh .
that shows initiative on their behalf .
the food is incredible .
i promise you wo n't be disappointed .
it shows and i ' m grateful .
it had some bacon around the outside .
the link is in my profile .
ca n't wait for a return engagement .
"skewers , priced from $ 0 to $ 00 ."
fried fish cake and stuffed leaf of napa cabbage .
overall will use again .
have nothing but good things to say about staff .
i will be back for sure .
"in a word , disgusting ."
"no fridge in room , not even a mini-bar ."
"everything was amazingly fresh , hot , and delicious ."
"it melts quickly , so eat fast ."
i had to spit it out .
the best part is the price .
we can write reviews on architectural designs / buildings ?
overall it ' s your average looking hotel .
great atmosphere and the food arrived quick .
the burger is great !
real good food and service .
"nice driver , but twice the price of uber ."
food is a bit expensive but good .
"fried pickles , man ."
all i got ta say .
location is convenient to south side bars .
the room itself is done on the cheap .
"good atmosphere , once you get inside ."
"lamb was tough , but vegetarian picks were good ."
too much quantity over quality .
waitress did n't know much about the food .
"good atmosphere , great food , excellent service ."
great from check in to check out .
"friendly staff , fantastic suite ."
"great venue , plenty of space with two stages ."
the food at cafe mix is truly amazing .
they have the best lamb gyros in town .
the owner is extremely nice .
the orange chicken is fantastic .
"both are excellent , pastry is light and delicious ."
"great place run by friendly , knowledgeable people ."
this is probably the future of chiropractic care .
what more could you possibly want ?
will try the pizza next .
went for the lunch special .
"- rrb - , and warm whiskey bread pudding ."
<UNK> playoffs on the tv .
food was excellent with a wide variety of options .
"overall , makes for a very good dinner ."
"pretty mediocre stay , all-in-all ."
much better than your standard hotel breakfast .
"in this case , it ' s <UNK> ."
should be trash out .
my wife thought it was horrible .
go away go away .
my wife liked the lit fireplace .
chips were a combo of puffy and toasted .
flan tasted pretty good .
the same tradition exists today .
we had : coors and soda for drinks .
"they also serve burgers , sandwiches and full entrees ."
"go and enjoy yourselves , we did ."
i know this is n't a traditional thai food .
the beef was over cooked .
i hope its true .
this review is about the dog park .
this place is a joke .
worst dog park i have ever seen .
just dirt and gravel .
just got my car washed today .
poor quality job done .
keep up the great work guys !
the western barbecue themed ambiance was awesome as well .
"the bedroom area is nice , with aforementioned <UNK> ."
the club and management are seriously irresponsible .
a must stop for any <UNK> fan !
"good flavor , eggs cooked just right ."
you guys are different .
"now , let ' s be clear on this ."
these were filled very nice and had great flavor .
stop in and enjoy .
"very interactive , the staff is helpful and nice ."
you will be entertained well for hours .
worth the entry fee .
the building is amazing .
i highly recommend it to anyone in the area .
i my favorite is the three cheese quesadilla .
now you know what not to do .
probably any other place would do better .
they do not let you to <UNK> .
we ate at this place on 00/0 .
will be going back .
awesome food & service - reasonably priced .
it ' s unreal ... .
"honestly , the place is <UNK> ."
this one does n't quite hit the mark though .
the chicken was cooked just as good .
better than average food for a bar .
orange <UNK> is great .
the sandwiches and pastries are outstanding .
it was a good snack at a fair price .
the fries were very good .
the logo was placed on several locations .
the drink machine was n't fully stocked .
this location is now out of business .
the location is closed .
this is n't your normal pizzeria .
all of the ingredients are fresh .
i had the bianco .
the food was great for the price .
i was told they start serving steak at 0pm .
the price was over $ 000 for the night .
great food ... aweful marketing .
update : a chicken is now closed .
a crew removed the sign yesterday .
the place is closed .
signs have been replaced and new banners posted .
where they severely lack is personality .
the person behind the counter never greeted me .
the same old blank stare .
all in all the place was ok .
i had knee problems that was diagnosed as <UNK> .
0 days later i <UNK> unable to walk again .
unfortunately i did n't like what i had here .
my burger fit the bill .
they also pride themselves on their shakes .
nutshell it ' s a good burger .
casino staff is friendly .
service very friendly staff at every stop .
there is only one electrical outlet near the beds .
conversation in the bar is strained at best .
"in this area , giada is superb ."
nothing was merely average .
i understand that giada is a celebrity chef .
her food speaks for itself .
service this was my biggest issue at giada .
atmosphere where to begin ?
"this is a playful , very nice touch ."
the portions are perfect for this type of menu .
it was a meal i ' ll remember .
the flavor is enjoyable .
my second time here .
overall if you love lobster this is a must .
wife ordered the chicken .
they cook it in front of you with style .
levi is a great dude gets there quick .
food is very good .
local place that is n't open on weekends .
hamburgers and hamburger steak is very good .
lot of options with an american fare theme .
great service and good specials .
the service was average and the food was poor .
the food was worse however .
i had a ceaser salad that was incredibly average .
my ny strip steak was over cooked .
ate at this place a few days ago .
i ordered lasagna and my wife ordered a burger .
once for brakes another for shocks .
all appointment times were right on time .
"no delivery , no call ."
very friendly and knowledgeable staff .
oh where is dan <UNK> or even a manager ?
tv did not work 0 .
bathroom door could not be locked 0 .
possibly the best kept secret of phoenix !
"all in all , a win situation ."
"still , a great quick stop for pho ."
"why not , i figured ."
the major <UNK> for me was the nachos .
this was a party of three .
the party that arrived five minutes after me .
this place has the best pizza .
in the cosmopolitan hotel in the third floor .
you can get a pie or a few slices .
it was ny pizza in las vegas .
they know everyone by name .
i always get house noodles and house rice .
only one time the food has been off .
beside that great food .
but the next day you forgot all about it .
but the turkey chili .
always get what you ask for .
my steak was on point .
my wife ' s however was not .
<UNK> ! ! ! salsas are on point .
would give a 0 star rating if possible !
i will be here at least once a week .
they showed up early and worked very quickly .
no damage to my stuff or the walls .
an excellent place to buy a car !
our evening was nothing short of remarkable .
"he sounded high , and was not polite ."
the bacon-wrapped dates were pretty good .
a delightful foodie experience .
this is perfect for what it is .
"furthermore , they ' re not always served fresh ."
are bartenders usually that much of a <UNK> ?
take that paragraph as you will .
"anyways , the burger i ordered ."
"but , it was unremarkable ."
"but i mean , it was palatable ."
probably my favorite starbucks in madison .
great park with scenic <UNK> on the lake .
it ' s a <UNK> field getting anywhere grassy .
this might be my favorite on state .
what ' s the problem with it ?
why is this a problem ?
"first of all , the outdoor seating is sublime ."
the indoor seating is great as well .
- lrb - whatever that means .
the good is that it ' s a starbucks .
"for this place , it ' s the setup ."
that ' ll be $ 0.00 .
i felt rushed and unwelcome .
the absolute worst thing for me was the location .
what even is this place ?
kind of makes madison feel like a real city .
"real , authentic , mexican ice cream ."
and the experience is authentic mexican .
but they ' ve all been forgettable .
like people are there cruising for a hookup .
parking was easy enough in the summer .
so why two stars ?
fish is fresh and the plates are well executed .
"to start , the location is fantastic ."
stopped by for dinner while exploring chinatown .
it was indeed great .
"service , food and selection ."
i would certainly go back .
very kid friendly environment .
the chicken sandwiches and burgers are no longer consistent .
avoid this place unless you ' re desperate .
or being held hostage .
visited <UNK> yesterday morning - truly a chandler gem .
been to a ton of cigar lounges .
staff is helpful and knowledgeable .
fox has set the bar at a new level .
"great work guys , keep it up ."
"both were artfully presented , fresh and delicious ."
the paint comes back alive and is restored .
i can recommend them without hesitation .
great to see a local business thriving .
. not your typical stuff .
the second and third time have been very disappointing .
"man , this is the real deal ."
"the fries were outstanding , but for me ?"
i usually enjoy my stay immensely .
this july i went while they were under construction .
at least your wallet will thank you .
"i got the jamaican one , not that great ."
"never laughed so hard , even at comedy clubs ."
the <UNK> of dt locals casinos .
"basically drunk food , but in a good way ."
tvs are the only reason to be here .
the sides were great as well .
an <UNK> recommended this shop to me .
the staff is friendly and help full .
you will not be disappointed .
this is a great hotel .
all the sandwiches are great and service is great .
paid over a 000 for a detail .
the service was only supposed to take 0 hours .
never had an issue with boxing .
that ' s totally acceptable to management though .
at least that ' s what i thought .
as the 0st girl is getting food orders completed .
i guess <UNK> is something of the past .
"order all you can eat , if your hungry ."
costco is well run and does a great job .
great chinese food at a reasonable price .
the lunch special is a great deal .
confirmed : delirium <UNK> on draft for $ 00 !
today i had a crown it went flawlessly .
great staff very friendly .
good food and atmosphere .
you will look like a pig .
"many , many , many options ."
"a fun , quirky spot in the old town ."
waitstaff was attentive and seemed happy to be there .
came here with my lady for a nice evening .
worst sushi i ever tasted .
you wo n't go anywhere else .
if you take anything away from this review .
this is another vegas staple .
awesome selection and love the new facelift .
the manager and staff are always very helpful .
this is an awesome place .
customer service is out of this world .
also the price for repairs are very reasonable .
really that ' s all you have .
had the beef ribs and they were great .
how do you mess that up ?
mac and cheese was the only disappointment .
the ray ray burger is out of this world .
score : minus - 0 star .
the meal was good ... really damned good !
"damn , this was good ."
"yeah , it was that good ."
and the other pizza just seemed kinda sloppy .
that ' s my responsibility .
a simple mistake on my end .
"my responsibility , i get that ."
i only owed $ 00 .
way to take care of your customers edge .
definitely a new neighborhood favorite spot for date nights .
i have always had a great meal here .
the service was also excellent .
i try to eat here once a month .
one of arizona ' s best restaurants .
"great vibe , excellent meal always ."
but <UNK> shirts always come out <UNK> .
very knowledgeable and friendly staff .
this store represents the company well .
i have eaten here twice .
great food and service .
top 0 italian meals ever .
"worth the price of admission come on , safeway ."
i have always had an excellent meal here .
i was surprised the one in phoenix closed down .
now it is plain dirty .
food quality is unpredictable and mostly poor .
spg brand is elevated by this location .
equipment is not well maintained .
. no attention to <UNK> machines .
place is not especially clean .
place is still not maintaining equipment .
this is supposed to be for maintenance of gym .
the place is getting dirty .
<UNK> and dust all around the machines .
service was slow and dismissive .
"the ambiance , service and food were excellent ."
excellent customer service - very friendly staff .
food was slightly pricey but delicious nonetheless .
exemplary customer at drive thru .
the service was exceptional and the food was incredible .
the beet salad was quite unique .
best crab cake in town ?
: - rrb - very friendly staff .
they had a wide selection at greatly reduced prices .
great sandwiches and desserts .
i have not had a bad meal yet .
great addition to the neighborhood .
$ 000 for two people no booze .
exceptional food every time .
the service exceptional and seamless .
ok it is getting better but needs some work .
they run out of stuff way too often .
the deli needs a lot of work .
i like this place .
this was a bit boring in spots .
consistently great in every way .
best steak in town .
i recommend this place without reservation .
i have to disagree with the bad review .
great addition to the neighborhood .
very friendly and knowledgable .
food is average at best .
how do you screw up breakfast ?
<UNK> quality level coffee .
approximately $ 00 for breakfast for two .
the downtown needs more restaurants and business .
"great , always clean place ."
the gym is great and never too crowded .
do n't hesitate to hire this firm .
i get take out from here all the time .
been here multiple times .
food and service are consistent and friendly .
you must be an extreme carnivore to eat here .
menu is hard to follow .
nothing but pork and beef .
the food was just average at best .
the food was bland and uninspired .
always great meal here .
dined here again last evening .
i had a very good meal here recently .
this is a great place .
great food and service .
always a great meal .
we need an excellent all around italian restaurant downtown .
"good food , clean ."
nice addition to the neighborhood .
they never seem to get the order correct .
will write an update regarding a subsequent visit .
the food and service were great .
that has got to be a tough location .
i greatly enjoyed this place .
polite and friendly staff .
saw this in vegas .
"sorry , no one does it like michael jackson ."
always great hawaiian food .
awesome goodbye cox cable boxes .
i will keep your internet service and home phone .
then i get rid of their internet .
i had a nice meal here with a friend .
friendly and clean staff .
this place has the perfect formula and consistent <UNK> .
pho was excellent with fresh ingredients .
always the highest quality .
best in phoenix hands down .
fantastic staff and business !
food is still awesome and fresh .
i have this catered at work often .
very consistent in taste and quality .
i always wonder why this location is not busier .
best pork ribs in town .
i recommend this to everyone .
i have never had a bad meal here .
"inexpensive , great service , off the beaten path ."
proud to take friends here .
who does that anymore ?
my 0 - year-old carpeting looks brand new .
pork was <UNK> dry and sauce was not tasty .
the worst <UNK> partner got sick the next day .
very skilled pt staff .
stuffed pizza ' s are the best .
cookie dough is great .
avoid this tourist trap at all costs .
i might has well have been playing dollar slots .
the replacement screens are better than the original ones .
melon and proscuitto appetizer great .
friendly concerned owner working the room .
great for takeout and eat in .
fast and consistent takeout .
"but , he told me it was worth <UNK> ."
who does business like this anymore ?
big clean well groomed park .
it is an awesome addition to the area .
i hope this place continues to thrive .
great food here but in desperate need of expansion .
just average to below average .
hard to screw up breakfast .
all the employees seemed absolutely miserable <UNK> the manager .
what a depressing mood in this place .
great people run this place .
rude customer service keeps me from returning here .
good food here consistently .
yes it is bad for you .
"clean , fast and predictable ."
they do the best shirt in town .
there is no denying their pizza is excellent .
it is consistently great .
eye is off the ball .
too many other better choices .
the finest hotel i have ever stayed in .
superb hotel and service from top to bottom .
the meat is very tender and juicy .
the staff was very friendly also .
what a fantastic place .
the wait staff was polite and attentive .
great destination dining with first class friendly service .
feels like a fancy cheese cake factory .
the pizza cooks are amazing .
the brick oven cooks the pizza perfectly .
i give them a strong recommendation .
the work they performed was extremely detailed .
"great company , great people and great service ."
the meat was a big let down for me .
simply no flavor which is unacceptable .
both places have horrible customer service .
so we had a wedding dress with no hanger .
the room smelled like old food .
the aria is a very nice hotel .
<UNK> is making the moving business better .
i look forward doing business with you again soon .
shameful to try to rip old people off .
the pho is off the hook .
what a great alternative to fast food .
can you imagine anything more dull and less original ?
but that ' s just the food .
convenient mediocrity gets eaten .
but the beef brisket .
and many of them are not happy .
a good pub is a wonderful place .
"now , vegas does n't have a perfect pub ."
what you ' d expect from a good pub .
the main downside to <UNK> ' s is cost .
so why only four stars ?
one of the better breakfast places in vegas .
big o tires does not do that .
but the restaurant somehow managed to dash those expectations .
"so , skip teriyaki boy ."
it ' s a step under mcdonald ' s .
"but <UNK> , las is doing a great job ."
style and function = 0 stars .
"first , the food ."
the <UNK> curry is solid .
the beef and meatball soup is similarly mediocre .
i guess it could be worse .
they do eggs right with some crispy bacon .
bagels are a deceptively simple food .
it ' s hard to insult a well-stocked place .
a simple bagel and cream cheese costs $ 0 .
that ' s a nice touch .
the food ai n't bad .
lettuce : fresh - rrb - .
absolutely worth a visit .
and they gather interesting foods from local bakeries too .
the staff is fast and friendly .
"first , the black coffee is great ."
this bar has a water wheel .
the place is clean and has its own charm .
solid lunch special with good spicy curries .
it is that good .
"fairly straightforward , right ?"
the concept is great .
the drink prices are ridiculous for east fremont .
and the drink pours were small .
no happy hour to speak of .
insert coins is not that place .
um ... who cares .
chocolate toppings on top of creamy <UNK> .
it ' s good enough .
i am diagnosing which wich with sandwich shop <UNK> .
specifically the roast beef and the buffalo chicken .
- cheese toppings : spot on .
solid tomatillo sauce as well .
and yet i occasionally agree to eat here .
well the buffet items alternate between tasteless and awful .
we ' re in the desert people .
this ai n't seattle .
why 0 stars already ?
because mexican food is awesome .
"hey , family-owned places are becoming rarer in vegas ."
"finally , downtown has a neighborhood coffee shop ."
"and hey , it has great coffee ."
and friendly owners who are enthusiastic about their business .
<UNK> is nostalgia in action .
first friday is a solid first step .
he ' s there to educate .
"he is , simply put , amazing ."
my only criticisms of the place is location .
an american flag hot pants outfit .
and the recommendation was spot on .
the encore is built around luxury .
and it charges for every element of it .
it ' s a quality upscale vegas buffet .
the brewing of <UNK> coffee is almost <UNK> .
"good people , good products - - wonderful staff ."
complaints will pretty much result in things getting worse .
you ' ll thank yourself for making the journey .
just being in this place feels like a joke .
the concept of the store seems absurd .
"well , somehow the food is consistently under-seasoned ."
what inspired this level of <UNK> ?
spice and seasoning in a food truck .
"hot damn , it ' s good ."
the roast beef sandwich is also tasty .
the main disappointment is the huevos rancheros dish .
"this place has an excellent , inviting atmosphere ."
enter the downtown cocktail room .
fresh ingredients and inventive flavors abound .
"that said , at least the place serves alcohol ."
simply put : this place is spot on .
<UNK> for early voting in nevada !
that ' s the good .
"the food is decent , but not remarkable ."
they say that hungry artists produce the best work .
and the park has a sound system to match .
"instead , the stadium uses a massive retractable roof ."
"well done , truck , well done ."
0 stars for the trip tip .
that ' s just a good time .
"no alternatives offered , no advice ."
you nailed it this time .
that ' s a win in my book .
i ' m a big fan of this place .
they ' ve won a regular customer .
"so , why three stars ?"
the chicken strips were n't all bad .
i ' m a fan .
the staff was friendly and very welcoming .
the acoustics are excellent .
"come for the whiskey , stay for the food ."
but the bar is a gem on its own .
but the bar is great .
problem is the coffee is unremarkable .
mocha joe also has some odd hours .
"problem is , most of us need tech support ."
need to play some blackjack for chips / cash ?
the four queens has its problems .
beer and cheese go well together .
"the mixed drinks are tasty , tart and <UNK> ."
the set up does have its issues .
so i say 0 stars all the way .
i first found her after throwing out my back .
it was a little disappointing .
"the attic , however , is a national treasure ."
but once you get in the door ... wow .
"however , the hot sandwiches are decent ."
the donuts are homemade and fried on spot .
there are very few t-shirts and shorts here .
and god blessed the bobbie .
thai vegas qualifies under all three .
"finally , the staff is great with pups ."
most people do the hike only once .
most people do the hike only once .
"first , the positives ."
the espresso drinks do n't fare much better .
it may be the tortilla chips the bar chose .
"the regular burgers are ... well , good enough ."
everything else drags the place down to 0 stars .
and mob bar is a good example of that .
the appetizers are decent enough .
"specifically , their whiskey shelf is growing ."
and they treat the ingredients right .
the non-meat dishes were similarly imaginative .
"the dish is messy , but who cares ."
"simple , salty as hell and delicious ."
eat the tots for a meal .
we need some dairy queen .
what kind of topping ?
"damn it , nurse !"
i ' m busy operating here .
this patient is suffering without that soft-serve .
<UNK> hash - - check .
rich and quality beef .
fresh fruit - - check .
the beef broth was well-prepared and pretty rich .
it was a very solid offering .
it all made for the perfect pho lunch .
"great <UNK> , this place is awesome ."
"<UNK> ooooh <UNK> , green ones ."
it ' s a burrito shop .
the green chile sauce is exceptional .
flat out one of the best taquerias in vegas .
a must visit for a mexican food lover .
do n't <UNK> in pizza mediocrity .
i have no complaints with the work .
but the cost still seems a little high .
bottom line : the dish is <UNK> awesome .
but loaded tots are seriously brilliant .
i have yet to have a bad meal here .
tamales were 0 stars .
food : great to good .
"short term , the food was bland ."
the side dish of beans was similarly bad .
the beans and beef were drowned out .
and the vienna beef hot dog was perfect .
the walls are covered in chicago memorabilia .
all hail the chicago dog .
you have to hand it to them .
"good call , panera <UNK> ."
and 0 brothers from italy jersey shore pizza satisfies .
the mozzarella they use is salted and delicious .
"simply , a great irish pub ."
the bartenders are knowledgeable and friendly .
caked las vegas does plenty to compensate though .
someone that quotes you an honest rate up front .
it ' s a complete rip off .
good beer and drink selection too .
and no prices on the beer menu ?
you ' re absolutely a <UNK> type of bar .
"so good job on the coffee , <UNK> ."
so why only three stars ?
this is where alternate reality comics is brilliant .
price : locals driving themselves get in free .
"but when they fail , the offer double the ."
"first , the mexican dishes ."
a <UNK> sauce was bland .
"at $ 00 , stay away ."
and this place is known for its deserts .
amazingly rich menu of thai favorites .
a huge selection of seafood .
"oh , and the buffet dishes are properly cooked ."
all around thumbs up .
the chocolate raised donut here is simply awesome .
the emergency room staff deserves 0 stars .
one last concern : they seemed a little disorganized .
it makes a gyro difficult to eat .
"stick a flag in the barrymore , everyone ."
it ' s just plain great .
appetizers : classic options with interesting taste twists .
put it all together and it ' s brilliant .
scallops with curried cauliflower : another perfect pairing .
the bar is worth a visit on its own .
fans of mixology will love this place .
save room for the tiramisu when you come here .
"so , two stars ."
and the mongolian beef was just blah .
"i like the people , just not the food ."
apparently food coloring is worse than wine on carpet .
"each borders is ... well , a borders ."
"lots of clever , tasty mixed drinks ."
they do a nice pour on the whiskey .
what the hell does that mean ?
ever had a pizza in ny ?
"all in all , not a bad pizza ."
almost every dish they brought out was a winner .
the cooks at diamond chinese nailed it .
they were spot on .
i am most definitely not a seafood guy .
the orange beef also deserves a huge thumbs up .
best orange sauce i ' ve ever tasted .
some of the other dishes were a bit disappointing .
the service was a mixed bag .
and east coast eats failed .
step up your game .
your cheese steak is bland .
your pizza is tasteless .
most boston food is bland and uninteresting .
and this place advertises itself as a boston eatery .
a step above pizza hut and dominoes .
the chicken fingers were excellent .
tender chicken under tasty breading .
the haddock sandwich was also tasty .
go there and you will not be disappointed .
and i ' ve never seen the place empty .
it tastes like a very good starbucks frozen drink .
hometown classic american eats is <UNK> .
i ' m sold on this place for breakfast .
"when testing a diner , i start simple ."
good job on the test hometown .
thumbs up all around .
"the breakfast burrito is simple , but good ."
they sell themselves as a <UNK> eatery .
the burger - - flavorless ground beef .
the chicken benedict - - surprisingly bland .
i ' m absolutely a fan of that burger .
the pub food ' s becoming downright worthwhile .
with urinals installed in the berlin wall .
viva the steady stream of men ' s urine !
viva public political statements !
viva a collection of local beers !
the coffee was <UNK> and rich .
never had a bad meal here .
"hands down , the best sausage in the world !"
chicken and ribs were very good .
- rrb - corn was pretty bad .
my wife was very happy with hers .
we did play slots there quite a bit .
my wife was glad i was with her .
their drink selection was very good as well .
their burgers are also top notch .
"good place wow , what an <UNK> dining pleasure !"
caprese tomatoes were spot on .
the pump i had was only a year old .
"great food , people and pricing ... ."
this is what good local establishments are all about .
this really is a great neighborhood pub .
i ca n't say enough about this place .
it was all way more than i expected .
you would never know driving up .
"great food , atmosphere and staff ."
"good food , friendly staff ."
the young lady at the register was great .
we frequent this place .
always a great meal .
"first of all , get over yourself ."
but not just the food .
great food and fun times at <UNK> games .
this employee door shut for us .
but really you ca n't go wrong .
it was ok but mediocre and unremarkable .
service was good enough .
not a good value .
you guys went down hill fast .
the best place on earth .
please for the love of god open more .
besides that it was a great hotel .
but one criticism - pet hate .
i had the porterhouse and i crushed it !
i have no major compliments .
management knows about this not doing anything .
we left after 00 minutes of confusion .
it was not a play or comedy .
that is not the case here .
<UNK> told me her mgr was in meetings .
all day passed at 000pm called <UNK> and <UNK> .
i highly recommend the breakfast americana .
great food for the price you pay .
"great concept , great recipes , poor execution ."
i had the sam i am burger .
keep up the fantastic work dave !
same with the shrimp .
throw away the salt shaker .
nice decor : if you like <UNK> <UNK> .
this place was a big surprise .
this brewery has very quality food across the board .
i tried the porter and stout .
"again , the food is top top notch ."
"the food was awful , quantity was bare minimum ."
lots of very interesting sandwich and wrap options .
and they are all good .
i ' ve tried most truly insane burgers .
hard to decide but they are all dope .
ca n't go wrong best chilli in charlotte .
solid option for a little indulgence at clt .
great burgers and fries .
not the best way to do business .
not enough dinner ware .
waited forever food and service .
biggest gripe : did n't even get my cocktail .
most of ladies were slightly dressed better in dresses .
these little plates are gon na fill me up ?
"the tenderloin was amazing cut , cooked perfectly !"
i liked the mrs ' dessert better .
i had a good buzz after finishing the large .
props to the design team for the interior .
not as many <UNK> in my opinion .
this location has a good mix of peeps .
bruschetta is the bomb !
drinks are good and they usually have good specials .

i had the special ny strip steak medium rare .
we got our entrees and everything looked great .
the steaks were good size .
this was a good feeling .
the carne asada tacos are the bomb !
the interior is great for eating a $ burger .

the food is good here .
"good coffee , good service and good food ."
hipster level - ok .
beer selection is excellent .
cool interior and good mix of people .
i want this place to be better and succeed !
pork belly was awesome !
the short ribs on the other hand were epic !
i want to give it 0.0 stars .

but ashley was having a tough night .
they had mixed up the sides on 0 dishes .
0 stars on service .
but the kid did a good job .
drinks - great beer selection .
mini pitchers are the way to go for sure .
pizzas - we split 0 .
really good if you like bs .
yeah it was good .
"i knew better , but crap !"
the fries it comes with are thin and tasty .
"some richness , some brown gravy , dunno ."
it is a little overpriced for what you get .
they have servers barely able to squeeze between tables .
do n't let this keep you from going there .
$ 0 imports / $ 0 house margs !
i think the the place was maybe 0/0 full .
got drinks and then waited for about 00 minutes .
' ' from the waiter .
my family is from nm .
i grew up on the stuff !
a truly memorable meal of quail .
place is a joke .
this time my wife went with me .
the intention was to share half both ways .

i do believe in giving people a second chance .
this is a great sports bar .
i mean it is <UNK> good .

"nope , they could not handle that either ."
the guarantee is n't made lightly .

his name was william .
this place will screw your order up .
it is not a kid friendly environment .

excellent independent coffee shop .
hometown feel with noda culture .
staff is friendly and the locals are interesting .
perfect food for a post workout lunch .
great sandwiches with all natural flavorful ingredients .
has become my standard place to eat .
good but too pricey for what you get .
arrive early or late in order to get in .
great restaurant with great food .
service was also excellent .
today i found out why .
i suggest you do the same .
"decent selection of beers , too ."
over priced with a small portions on your plate .
the entire experience was incredible .
"folks , this is mediocre at best ."
white fish for the fish and chips .
very courteous staff and high level of service .

good service but the food was just ok .
very sad i thought these guys were honest .
the entire garage door was replaced .
very impressive place with quality food and service .

amenities are a large tv with limited channels .

i dont consider a bad paint job and <UNK> .
we were primarily interested in dinner .
and not to forget a very reasonable pricing schedule .

otherwise you are wasting you money .
pleasure pit ... 0 stars .
the food was average .
employees were very chill and accommodating .
"more games , better value ."
refried beans tasted like canned but were acceptable .
for the money this place ca n't be beat .

maybe this was the problem .
"exceptionally clean , very friendly , and amazing value ."
cant wait till they come to the philadelphia area .
communication seems to be an issue .

the show and the <UNK> were a + .
go to vegas to see the show .

the ranch was out as well .
this is amazingly good .
keep up the good work .
former moon valley and apollo <UNK> are the owners !
worth the money ... great value ... and fun .
we were seated promptly and immediately offered drinks .
clam chowder was great and steaks were really good .
it ' s a virtual experience in treasure hunting .
i purchased a 00/00 internet .
stay away from cox .
i had my first haircut here many years ago .

excellent all the way around !
no mention of <UNK> and no case manager .
had the east coast platter .
the fish was soggy with grease and barely warm .
left and went down the street to smashburger .
usually there for a light dinner .
wondering if the management has changed .
"steak and salmon combo , loaded mashed potatoes ."
even had a cool game pad .
they even beat the price their competitor was charging .
definitely a cool spot to kick back and chill .
i highly recommend this place .
and charging me for deep cleaning for $ 000 .
ca n't you serve coke too ?
but it ai n't much of a chile <UNK> .
dinner was a particular pleasure .
everything we ate was a real pleasure too !
did n't seem to fit together too well .
burger options were nicely varied .
lots to see and do .
"exceptional check-in clerks , <UNK> and valets ."
mash was barely browned and no garnish at all .
no visual appeal and no <UNK> appeal either .
manager was finally summoned .
but cleaned up they were ... eventually .
was intent on a great lunch .
closed for a while .
a nice combination of value and options .
we had a nice experience and fairly decent food .
serving chicken on the bone .
twelve bucks for a piece of cheesecake or cannoli .
some did n't look like was being described .

smokey and <UNK> charred perfection .
"excellent , excellent , excellence ."
i had a fantastic drink - the heritage manhattan .

late breakfast before check-out .
otherwise this would have been a 0 - star .

friday night thru sunday night is seafood time .
you ca n't beat the selection and price .
time for a renovation and upgrades there .
this buffet has a good selection .
this creates a good issue .
all you can eat pizza and salad bar .
"they primarily serve one thing , prime rib ."
this one is great .
a great invention and excellent cheese sauce .
i recommend ka over the others .
go for the double bacon cheeseburger .
they said you get a double and bottomless fries .
good thing it was free .
the cheesesteak with hot peppers and onions ?
they now have 00 inch sandwiches at this location .
the bacon cheeseburger is my recommendation .
they have decent pub quality fried mushrooms .
this is like an east coast cheese steak stand .
excellent chef and owner .
about a 00 minute wait .
service was good even though they were busy .
dining area is not very huge .
"skillet was good , pancakes were great ."
this is still a good burger .
this place is pretty good for a tavern .
philly cheesesteak was good .
00 and up only .
you get decent chain restaurant food here .
the quality of the food is still good .
so many critics on this one .
this place is a good value for the price .
great service too jimmy johns .
these guys are all speed .
try the number 00 .
definitely not your ordinary burgers !
he delivers excellence here !
a reservation would be recommended .

then i had the spicy miso burger .
there ' s a ramen place next door .
this place is the definition of awesome .
beer was $ 0 a bottle .
"after 0 visits , the 00th is on them ."
the menu was simple and everything looked very appetizing .
all experiences here have been great .
but the real winner here is the food !
the food was outstanding as well .
also spanish egg tortilla .
definitely highly recommended if you are into tapas .
the margaritas are good as is there salsa .
i tried one chicken and one beef .
chicken was the better of the two .
the chile <UNK> looked particularly appetizing .
been to blueberry hill many times ... highly recommended .

the place was very nice inside and outside .
impressive shot menu as well .
. this is then your spot .
"the food was ok , not great ."
. service was great .
tons of beers on tap !
was the last of three bids i got .
ultra was the cheapest by far .
i ' d use them again anytime .
great local sports bar !
and no need for clean sheets or towels .
. the smoke everywhere was very special .
tips are enjoyed by the staff .
they need to be retained .
owners of this franchise do n't seem to care .
you ' re either lying or <UNK> clueless .
the mini golf is an absolute disgrace !
you all must be very proud of yourselves .
"the beer is good , though ."
the food was very good and flavorful .
what an awesome hotel experience .
spent four days here for two penguins games .
"plus , right next door to consol center ."
the game day experience is top notch .
very spacious and the ownership is very friendly .
i ordered a 00 piece traditional ... .
listen enthusiastically and respond positively .
our total dining experience lasted over 0â 0/0 hrs .
i used to be a regular customer .
the pizza was great and nice people .
want a good bbq sauce ?
this place is a joke .
i ' ll be a returning customer for sure .
portions are huge and very tasty .
i can see the storefront from my building .
anyone can put out fancy plates and cutlery .
i will pay good money for good food .
spend your money elsewhere .
another let down by encore !
sandwiches were not huge like on the wynn channel .
flavor and service fell short .
spend your money elsewhere .
cons - skip the sushi .
you should n't be eating sushi at any buffets .
wtf ! ! my favorite hotel on the strip .
"make no mistake , this place is awesome ."
i had a bone-in ribeye .
it was seasoned well and cooked to perfection .
seriously the worst starbucks ever .
the chicken for my fajitas was very dry .
my wife enjoyed her tinga .
the prices were very fair and service was excellent .
this attitude totally sucked .
rarely do we not get a good meal .
' ' tacos were $ 00.00 to 0.00 .
my wife ordered salt and pepper tofu .
food is great and quick .
"yes , it is good ."
did not live up to the hype .
look it ' s good .
0 stars for the interior and setting .
chipotle has spoiled us all .
a mixed bag for sure .
not worth a trip to go check out .
ice cream was unique and tasted very fresh .
"again , excellent portion size ."
one is the rolex store .
just go see it .
the layout of the store is stunning .
"<UNK> boutique , boom !"
got 0 dim sum offerings and the mushroom taco .
any hotel can give you the action in vegas .
nastiest tacos de <UNK> an lengua .
sucks ! ! good tacos de asada only .
you can never go wrong eating here .
one of the best places in town .
their other menu items are also pretty tasty .
the desserts were also quite good .
one of the coolest things i have ever seen .
they also have extremely reasonable rates .
my only issue was with the final battle scene .
they could have done better .
"like everything else , not bad just not great ."
the crepe stand is definitely worth your attention .
it was another average vegas buffet for me .
the food was just ok though .
overall the place is alright .
$ 0 <UNK> and $ 0 bottles of beer .
nice music and great feel to the place .
food was outstanding with good portion sizes .
"overall , pretty lackluster restaurant ."
this is a smart place .
all they serve is pig meat which is good !
very wierd and <UNK> .
food was very good and a lot of choice .
the service is probably one of the best .
the chateau was very moist and juicy .
simply one word wow .
i went there several time .
what a waste of time .

will i ever repeat this experience ?
the only down side would be the location .
all of them were good nothing to complaint about .

the pizza was very good and the bacon crispy .
"cheers , eric van nguyen food is great !"
the staff are very friendly and professional .
emphasize the bad in bad daddy burger !

ca n't say enough how much these guys rock .
bike shop is the best .
definitely my bike shop .
thank goodness for yelp reviews when in a pinch .
excellent value for money paid .
i eventually gave up .
very cool and hip venue with clientele to match .
this includes the fishbowl drinks .
bathroom ceiling fan sounded like a freight train .
but for the most part the food is excellent .
awesome shop made a poor experience a good one .
everything was excellent and cooked to order .
"it is a buffet , not fine dining ."
well worth it too .
best restaurant in montreal .

this place is the bomb .
this place is the greatest .
and wrote up a statement saying that it was .
and when i took it back down there .
stay away from this place .
and treat you like crap .
the fries were ok but nothing special .
"so everyone , do n't waste your money here ."
we could have a conversation without raising our voices .
my girlfriend had the bacon wrapped pork loin .
just ate there for the first time .
holy crap is it all so good .
everything we got was excellent .
not that great and the service was spotty .
i should have gotten something more traditional .
it ' s also very noisy inside .
nicky ' s is way better .
they are all completely overrated .
the food is not worth the long waits .
that is food worth waiting for .
tried the steak burger because the <UNK> article .
the bread it ' s on is fantastic .
i will be back sometime to try something else .
i guess a plate of meat or something .
pretty good but not great .
black bean dip is the best .
meatball paninis are the bomb .
probably should have gotten the tator tot one .
it is literally the best you will ever eat .
waited 00 minutes in line .
the level of incompetence is astounding .
nice place for a casual date !
the service was also consistently good .
that ' s the story at golden wok .
the soups are outstanding .
family service and great food .

it ' s a dump now .
try to valet a car .
the place is worn out .
service is usually good but can be spotty .
guy got in my car drinking a coke .
management completely non responsive .
one of the most interesting menus in town .
our wait staff was extremely polite and attentive .
we were treated like kings .
perhaps they were trained in france .
there are lots of places to eat in vegas .
0000 called and wants their sleazy car salesman back .
not full of cranky old men and gun snobs .
they ' ve done six jobs for me .
all were well done and on time .

it could be better - it could be worse .
they did a good job with the remodel .
the place is more friendly but also more upscale .
the food is easier to access .
much improved over my original review .
updated : this place has improved .

would highly recommend for burger lovers .
would rate this hotel a 0.0 .
both times were very pleasing .
the staff also kept the place pretty clean .
there was bbq chicken as well .
great way to celebrate with this high calorie restaurant .
very funny to see when it happened .
the reason why is to enjoy the experience .
hope this helps you decide .
just one of them can feed 0-0 normal individuals .
the tenders were pretty good .
"the chicken was fresh , moist and tender ."
where most get it wrong is in the breading .
some can be too hard and dense .
which makes chewing easier .
"still , a good place for your pizza needs !"
$ 00.00 before tax .
highly recommended for a quick burger bite !
but a surprising delight to have in my hotel .
they also have burritos as well .
wendy ' s is normally good for fast food .
"once is oops , twice is simply poor management ."
the one star is a gift from yelp .
explained everything and left everything perfect .
well worth the money .
their outdoor sitting area is great on sunny day .
the fried chicken was shockingly good .
coffee was nice a strong .
hot sauce was already on the table .
real butter was served .
great cold cuts and subs .
amazing homemade italian sausage .
everyone mentions the <UNK> and it deserves it .
tried this place on a recommendation .
overall i would not come back again .
use this location for all your printing needs .
time and a couple of more visits will tell .
my wife gets chicken fingers and she loves them .
so how can they justify that price ?
no value means lost customers ... .
the falafel was decent could use some work .
prices are fair but not amazing .
i ' ll be back with friends and family .
he explained the menu thoroughly and made suggestions .
we started with the <UNK> and beef jerky .
i could eat a plate of that .
"good food , decent prices , reasonable service ."
for lunch i tried the poutine .
the shepherd ' s pie filling was delicious .
these did not compare well with the pizza .
lots of dark wood benches .
"nothing wrong , nothing extra ."
the salt and pepper squid were also fine .
"that all being said , i will go back ."
it ' s a nice airy and open environment .
that was a theme here .
the service and the food both surpassed my expectations .
food that keeps me coming back .
ripped me off on my 00 trail blazer .
took our car in for fuel problem .
they changed the fuel <UNK> .
"plus , it was a very reasonable price ."
sauce comes on the side .
one of my top 0 gangster movies !
burgers were up to reputation .
we called in advance to get poker room rates .
please frequent those locations .
this place was perfect .
can not <UNK> what a great experience this was .
"- rrb - , but at least plentiful ."
greens are sourced from arizona farmers .
the kids enjoyed <UNK> their golf balls .
the course was a challenge for the <UNK> .
had great food and service .
the only thing that was ok was the salsa .
would recommend this company .
although the bread is pretty good .
"good service , good food , and good vibes ."
dim sum here are pretty good .
the only problem i have are the workers here .
the food is good .
i like this place better than ono hawaiian .
the only problem i have is their consistency .
the place is very modernized .
slam the door and stared us away .
i would not get this drink again .
this is not even new york style pizza .
that ' s just not right .
it was practically a <UNK> .
' ' the meal itself was marginal at best .
they deserve a 0.0 .
get with it yelp !
kitchen / bath faux wood cabinets look very nice .
i love the crown molding and high ceilings .
the soso : 0 .
my electric is higher than it should be .
so i scheduled a touch up .
this is my goto <UNK> !
it looked clean and well maintained .
the duck roll appetizers were awesome .
it was very good .
and the service was quick and friendly .
- the place has a cool look and vibe .
sometimes we americans do n't get simple elegance .
take advantage of it .
smart way to earn your tip !
should you try it ?
"apparently , some people eat cooked meat ."
i ' m not into giant buffets .
i ' m not into <UNK> casinos .
i ' m not into elvis impersonators .
"if you want vegas cheese , go elsewhere ."
"- lrb - thanks , yelp !"
carts are only part of the story here .
what more could you want ?
people watching from the third floor window .
perfect location in vieux montreal .
in room kitchenette with <UNK> coffee makers .
definitely a place that deserves repeat business .
only cans and bottles .
we both ordered pasta as a main course .
the cheesecake was a slight disappointment to my wife .
which is fine if that is what you expect .
the espresso was also outstanding .
a great way to end the meal .
"in short - good food , impeccable service ."
the service was quick and efficient .
"and this , actually , was a problem ."
` ` the stuff ' ' .
and my wife ordered the roasted chicken .
i thought it was very tasty indeed .
the steak was pretty much a failure .
the fries ... they were great .
they had 0 desserts available and 0 contained peanuts .
not really their fault on this one .
their bbq burger is also good .
of being different instead of servicing customers .
they ' re great here .
do you like traditional fries or <UNK> fries instead ?
want lots of good burger options ?
want your burger any way you want it ?
in two words - they sucked .
great little coffee place that is n't * bux .
what more do you want ?
the wait staff was excellent .
way cheaper than wal-mart and way cleaner .
never waste money at walmart again .
this denny ' s is great .

"the staff is polite , fast and very consistent ."
its clean and <UNK> is extremely nice .
- lrb - walter my waiter deserves a raise !

the service was beyond poor .
the amount of cheese is just unreal .

what did they do about it ?
"not bad , not great ."
"got a bacon breakfast burrito , added ham ."

way overpriced even for mario batali .
best of the meal was the dat tam dessert .

great finish with coconut ice cream .
"good food , extremely loud environment , great waiters ."
and what a performance it was .
ca n't stop thinking about those bagels .

its location is a suburban scottsdale shopping center .

broken plate wall is a great touch .
i would say this is a must order dish .
incredibly fresh food with some great hospitality and friendliness .
"in short , xs lives up the hype ."
"well besides gamble , hit the club of course !"
"well , naturally you would give tao a chance ."
tao is a good place to go .
"the drinks however , are pretty damn expensive ."
excellent location and staff .
they will make your club going experience very enjoyable .
they will make your club going experience very enjoyable .
they will make your club going experience very enjoyable .

we liked the place and will likely try again .
the food was excellent !
my trainer is unique and great .
her name is <UNK> .

"service on the other hand , ehhhh ."
roasted pork belly - lrb - lechon kawali .

a town known for its culinary trends .
you should also train better bar servers / bartenders .
"i ' m like , wtf to that ?"
kudos to the other server who assisted the bartender .
"overall wise , i will be back ."
little kick but just great taste .
little loud but fantastic everything .
unreliable and sometimes aggressive delivery service .
very difficult to deal with in general .
why in the hell are you here ?
these guys are great !
they do n't take amex !
"even for vegas , that ' s up there ."
all in all a recommended stop .
all were very good .
the dover sole is not to be missed .
you ' ll thank me later .
you have to get the chili .
not a $ $ restaurant try $ $ $ .
a $ 00 burger should be better than that .
they also need to learn how to cook lobster .
"less quantity , sure ... but more quality ."
' ' questioning our integrity about the matter .
ca n't you just get a beer ?
you ca n't even pronounce the name .
' ' in a completely demeaning and condescending tone .

this place is awful .
as for the prices being higher ?

the staff is great awesome food .

now for the real story .

so i asked a busboy waking by .

the staffs here are also very professional and friendly .

i should have taken the hint by that .
stock up and freeze it .
hmm well i had to play this out right .
the steak and seafood is very good .
no surprises good or bad .
"classic , old vegas ."
service is top notch .
binions has the best view of vegas .
"first and foremost , the food tastes good ."
the fried chicken is served in miniature fryer baskets .
the $ 00 kobe burger was outstanding !
beet salad with walnuts and fennel also very good .
the urban scramble breakfast is great !
nice local bar near the sheraton .
beats the hotel bar any day .
do n't miss this place .
the bar also has some good food .
everywhere you look there is nothing but filth .
please avoid this place at all costs .
las vegas scam alert !
i went ahead and let them do this .
avoid this place at all costs !
not bad for cardboard .
pizza was over cooked and had little flavor .
consider me a former customer .
both were good size and very well made .
"again , both were very well prepared ."
it ' s usually $ 00 + .
highly recommend this place .
not recommended just go to walmart or somewhere else .
great stop for a fresh and tasty sandwich .
so was it all that bad ?
what an disaster of a restaurant .
i will go back for the ribs another time .

i have tasted much better elsewhere .
the food and wine was what you would expect .
overall an average place to have lunch in vegas .
the steak was both seasoned and cooked to perfection .
as good as it gets .
shockingly bad food and service .
a disastrous breakfast decision .
good steaks but no atmosphere .
this place is no <UNK> period .

"simply put , they were a customer service disaster ."
' as if we are all near death !

this place gets it right every visit .
this place is another <UNK> .
the service was fast and incredible friendly .

it just took a while .
they have serviced my cart very well .
he has never done business with them .
the main issue with this place was the food .

go outside peak hours to minimize the wait .
"instead , you buy a growler of cider ."
"once you have a growler , refills are cheaper ."
got take-out lunch from this diner .
"great beer , good food , somewhat pricey ."
a place well worth visiting at least once .
"so harrahs it was , food is ok here ."
their dinner is simply awesome !
outstanding off the beaten path .
eclectic drinks and superb staff .
the toppings were from local providers .
why not have place mats then ?
the beverages : typically an operation ' s <UNK> .
the owner should be ashamed of themselves .

the chicken was very moist and tender .
you can have two different broths per cooking stove .

overall this chain is consistent .
it ' s not bad combo and tasted alright .
service at the table was pretty good .

andrew did a great job ... excellent service .
vegas sucks in 0000 .
the veal parm is freaking amazing .
the slaw was underwhelming .
"the dance floor was half empty so , wtf ?"

all in all it was an epic pizza fail .
so much for the comparison between pizza & sex ...
got double with cheese and fries to go .
the food arrived and was just ok .

then the strangest thing happened .

pretty basic chinese food .
prime rib night was just ok .
"however , bottom line 0 stars ."
food not as good togo as eating there .

worst sales reps ever .
this location gets worse and worse .
verizon store reps used to be helpful .
i am <UNK> a positive review .
wow what a bad experience .
"brown stew chicken , jerk chicken are my favorites ."
their caesar salad with grilled tofu is my recommendation .
maybe because i ' m an asshole ?
what ' s the deal ?
miles of local cheese .
bellagio has gone down hill lately .
first impressions were quite positive .
then the entree came .
the apple fritter was simply a masterpiece .
the chicken and shrimp were underwhelming as well .
my wife got the broccoli w / tofu .

dealing with evan is like dealing with an add .
your car is a expensive investment not a toy .
so learned expensive lesson .
chris really hooked it up .
these guys can cook !
"the highlight , though , was the pork belly ."

the ribs were a huge disappointment .
the brisket was rather dry and had little flavor .
everyone has reported a good experience .

great spot to connect to wifi and local community .
and its only gotten worse every time .
ca n't back up once your in .

"but , my recent experiences have been disappointing ."
. maybe new recipes ?
i would highly recommended them .
this is definitely a highly recommended breakfast spot .

for entrees we tried the sampler platters .
' ' i am not kidding you .
"prices were reasonable , food was edible 0.0 stars ."

as good as it gets .
businesses just are n't run well anymore .
this place did not deliver .
great value for the cost .
it seems everyone one of them offer overpriced options .
"firstly , the setting ."
the theatre royal is perfectly positioned .
you are paying for the location and atmosphere .
the menu here caters for all .
the other half is more traditional .
the food here is nothing short of <UNK> !
"tried tako , limu , and shoyu ahi ."
this one is not one you should choose .
this place has it right .
i ordered kung pao chicken and it was great .

i followed this up with a slice of cheesecake .
0 the beer selection is lacking .
"for food court food , this is phenomenal ."

"luckily , the sandwiches here are great ."
paper was five dollars and up .
on a 0 hour <UNK> flight to europe .
she stuck a styrofoam cup over the light .
"inside , it was busy ."
but more as a novelty than anything else .
"then , it ' s packed ."
you might be better off opting for beer .
"nothing tired and stereotypical , just good booty music ."
this is the place to do that .
"overall , three roots is pretty rad ."
lolo ' s does not skimp .
"perfectly seasoned , juicy , and again , <UNK> ."

do you really need that much security ?
the patrons walk around in a <UNK> <UNK> .
the food is n't bad .

no explanation needed there .
is n't that the default ?
- rrb - no big deal .
"the coffee itself was great , by the way ."
"bright , vibrant notes , smooth and intense ."
i suggest you do the same .
the aguas frescas taste great and are cheap .
it ' s ... sexual .
it was really damn good iced tea .
ask for a recommendation .
the selection is not bad .
ca n't imagine going anywhere else .
- lrb - 0â 0/0 stars .
this place is alright .
"but hey , think of it as an adventure ."
lots of neon blue lighting against steel <UNK> .
"but hey , i ' m not complaining ."
this place has been here in this location forever .
"so , this place definitely has nostalgia for me ."
i thought it was a phoenix thing ?
the food is n't really anything special .
"honestly , it ' s rather forgettable ."
does it represent that ?
"unfair , i know ."
it ' s actually pretty clean and maintained inside .
but to no avail .
the new times lied .
"no drama , just <UNK> ' out ."
is n't this just ... velveeta ?
but i really did n't have a choice .
"moreso than most places , it seems ."
and the fondue was enjoyable .
- rrb - are way tacky and gimmicky .
the sushi we had was pretty good .
everything seemed fresh and well-prepared .
thai food is traditionally spicy .
certainly not ` ` thai medium .
' ' and a pretty good dj rotation .
it can take a while to get a drink .
"i will certainly be back , though ."
i recently saw yacht and washed out perform here .
they close early at 0 pm .
this place is a trip .
"but come on , f . g . !"

most meats are sold by weight .
the sides are not too much to brag about .
there was way too much icing to roll ratio .
seasoning on the chicken was good but not extraordinary .

the cavatelli with lamb was insane .
possibly the best dish there .
the desserts were great and numerous .
the rest of the hotel is boring .
full of bling but boring .

i had paid in advance for an upgraded room .
this place is a fortune .
you might as well be sleeping on the floor .
they also <UNK> indoor and outdoor gondola rides .
great sushi and seafood buffet !
the lazy river is a complete joke .
they sell tubes for at least 00 dollars .
we brought our tubes from ny .
the lazy river is not lazy at all .
the elevators were a total mess .
great restaurant with fine mexican cuisine .
prices are very low for the quality and quantity .
not near good enough for what you pay .
dillon was great working with .
food is average and the service is poor .
this place is shady !
go with a respectable company .
he was a maestro in the kitchen .
the food was excellent .
all in all a great mother ' s day .
the steaks were medium-rare .
oh yeah ... the bread .
"sincerely , a loyal customer ."

chef ' s cooking method keeps them wings moist .
i predict an awesome breakfast tomorrow .
the pizza from this location is consistent and predictable .
now for the food .
"please , talk to your staff ."
hope you do better for us next time .
our complaint is with the snack bar .
not with the donuts - they are fine .
not good enough to warrant these many issues .
someone needs to hose that place down !
the impact was immediate .
i recommend them to you without hesitation .
you have to try the chicken tacos .
"two bucks for delivery is reasonable , too ."
keep up the good work .
what is happening at the wigwam ?
getting lost at wigwam is easy .
<UNK> help is not easy anymore .
maybe someone stole them ?

my caesar salad was also a major let down .
the margarita was mucho <UNK> .

i ordered the dry aged ny sirloin .
you ca n't beat the names of their rolls .

$ 000 for wi-fi is ridiculous .
the clean rooms and well-maintained atmosphere are nice too .
there are a great set of stores here .
i stayed here for a conference .
the standard room i stayed in was fairly large .
<UNK> is located inside the westin hotel .
not a bad option if you ' re hungry .
the portions are gigantic .
it tasted a bit stale .
i ordered the pastrami hot sandwich .
"visited on oct 0 , 0000 ."
my wife had a different plate and felt fine .

the salad and mash potatoes were excellent .

the menu is reduced during these hours .
so i asked to be seated .
the ambience is cool though .
i ' d much prefer eating at <UNK> grill .
a las vegas staple .
you wo n't be let down .
the <UNK> sprouts were phenomenal .
the ambiance is great for a lounge .
they are more to manage capacity and glassware .
service was friendly but slow .
the checkout counter never seems to have enough staff .
came here with a <UNK> mindset .
it reminds me of a mexican themed <UNK> .
great for tourists though .
check the website for a hotel description .
i would and will return .
"room was a great rate , and very nice ."
0 bedroom with a full kitchen .
pure - get your game up .
the service is hit and miss at this location .
great food great service ... .
none of who would call back .
the flights were on time and were really smooth .
i saved a couple hundred dollars using this airline .
the problem was the food .
it ' s also open 00 hours .
the burger was cooked very well .
the portion size was reasonable for the cost .
it was also very reasonably priced for lunch fare .
that knocks it down a bit .
columbus day was on the following monday .
they had a pizza station which was pretty good .
yes i sure did .
"overall , this place was pretty good ."
this was my first visit to this place .
many are craft beers .

but they do a good job still .
i own a landscape company in the east valley .
"great food , service was ` good enough ' ."
this place is an absolute gem .
great sandwiches as always .
my favorite is the new york steamer .
"best pastrami anywhere , for sure ."
excellent concept and keeping things unique and flavorful .
great casual place that still looks like fine dining .
<UNK> completed the work during the allotted time .
the folks that work here treat you like family .
not a sit down to eat place .
sat down at bar was given a menu .
its not the food but that bartender was horrible .
you wo n't regret it .
now onto the food .
overall i was just ok .
my concern however was when i got the bill .
the terrace is great .
not going there ever again .
the five spice is very prominent in this soup .
the times have changed .
it is available from 00pm to 00am now .
another dish i like is the prime rib dinner .
ca n't beat it for around $ 0 .
"on top of that , service was below average ."
last night i had their <UNK> burger .
the wait service was very good .
the place looks like an upscale restaurant .
they need better cooks back in the kitchen .
the place was always clean .
"great shrimp , sausage , and corn !"
vegan donuts ; what is this about ?
it ' s about $ 0 for a beer .
i ordered the roast beef dip .
they just slapped on a cold piece of cheese !
shops and restaurants seem good .
food is great service was poor .
the <UNK> <UNK> is very good as well .
see my other reviews for details .
i ' ve been to that place .
just come to <UNK> .
maybe these are just growing pains .
you can see my pic for the benny .
unfortunately that tomato mozzarella is a freaking joke .
the meatball and pork kebob were so-so .
here is something to note .
ordered a baked spaghetti to go .
this place has pretty good tempura .
some people you just want to smack .
the place is decent .
i still like tommy ' s and in-n-out better .
overall the food was pretty good .
the hunter club and the <UNK> are my favs .
had my car <UNK> .
terminal 0 was awesome .
no more riding the tram to the d gates .
desserts are pretty satisfying as well .
that sundae is ridiculous .
"chili cheeseburger , chili cheese fries , large coke ."
man i love me some tommy ' s !
just do n't go expecting a chipotle experience .
they leave a greasy film all over the place .
the grilled onions were greasy as well .
the basket of fries and rings .
the deep fried fish taco was good .
the <UNK> burrito was cold !
maybe baja fresh will get their act together .
if you can do that i will be back .
the chile colorado was n't that great .
looks like this place is out of business .
"the food is good , but damn pricey ."
"so , another small business killed by big business ."
their delivery is pretty consistent and courteous .
"sometimes , things just get cooked right ."
more 0â 0/0 than three .
"btw , i prefer the filet ."
the <UNK> is great .
since you order everything individually it comes out individually .
not the most efficient way of doing it .
it ' s in-n-out burger .
the horseradish was a little overpowering .
the meat <UNK> it ok .
love the coke super soda machine .
the only real issue i have are the fries .
"seriously , obnoxiously loud and obnoxiously repetitive ."
house <UNK> was good but maybe a little oily .
more of a 0.0 stars than just a 0 .
overall it was a pretty tasty dog .
$ 0.00 is a pretty good price .
"had the orange crush , would have preferred coke ."
they also have burgers and other items added .
the pictures of the burgers looked pretty good .
i personally cant go that far .
i heard the burger was good .
doing a promo to meet jerry rice .
cheapest item with tax was almost $ 000 .
"geisha special , shrimp and <UNK> tempura et ."
you wo n't be disappointed .
always consistent and at a premium price .
no real <UNK> at the bar .
"new place or not , this is basic ."
brown rice and a med drink for 0.00 .
maybe 0 min later someone yelled my name .
` ` fool me once ... ' ' .
departed the premises at 0:00 .
some places have good meat and others do n't .
not sure how freshly cooked it was either .
maybe this place is better during a rush hour .
the shrimp was ice cold .
the pizza is consistently good .
i ' m not really a pho kinda guy .
this place could be really really good .
always a consistent sub from kevin and his staff .

this is a genuine 0 stars .

these guys are really close to a 0 star .
great kebabs and i love the mediterranean salad .
service is very good as well .
definitely put this place on your list .
low expectations which are usually exceeded .
it had a taste and consistency of meatloaf .
so the burger was almost cold .
sometimes the steak is rare .
actually a lot of times the steak is rare .
overall the burrito or burrito bowl hit their mark .
i think this place has potential .
the pricing was pretty good too .
the place was decent .
had dinner here a couple days ago .
two sandwich meal deals was almost $ 00 .
the food was decent .
the ribs were the same thing .
most other teppan yaki placed in town include it !
well at least the good ones do .
well that was it .
these guys are always pretty good .
filet and shrimp at <UNK> is <UNK> $ 00 .
the roast beef was mushy ?
the thai curry wings were not very good .
much love for the slider truck .
the place is ok .
some times that place is soooo freaking loud .
"not necessarily overwhelmingly good , but consistent ."
you get what you get and that is consistency .
especially based on the recent reviews here .
now for the bad news .
and that was for only 0 adult beverage .
was hoping for an exceptional tempura .
ca n't remember the name .
<UNK> must be cheaper .
all were ordered at a five spice level .
this does not make sense .
not shocked this place closed .
the paella was horrible .
maybe i just caught them on a bad day .
the meat is another story .
it was both the chicken and the steak .
"not superb , but consistently good ."
this place is just ok .
double double animal style and a chocolate shake !
especially if there is <UNK> over the register receipts .
"ok , the hype <UNK> the product ."
a regular carne asada taco is $ 0 .
hopefully these are just growing pains .
i wish these guys lots of success .

this place is decent .
this place is pretty decent .

this is a solid three .
the sauce lacks enough flavor for my tastes .
i ' d have rather give 0â 0/0 stars .
the chicken was dry and overcooked .
the coleslaw was n't that good .
took almost 00 minutes to get the bowl .
that ' s what i had .
the sausage was overcooked as well .
<UNK> <UNK> is 0 for two .
a bigger dining room could serve them well .
the ebi and unagi were great as usual .
typically you ca n't go wrong with outback .
onions are always rancid and the tomatoes were green .
same experiences at the sahara / decatur one .
"great food , great value , big portions ."
it ' s the best in town .
this place used to rock .
the chicken had a rubbery quality to it .
<UNK> puts out a much better product .
however it was not to be .
it will change the way you eat burgers .
i expected more at this price point .
the menu was not what shows up on yelp .
the place is overpriced even for a kosher restaraunt .
they should call this place <UNK> greed .
the basic steam items were ok .
right now i ' m working on the jersey .
"so , check this place out ."
the cafe is your basic vegas 00 hour cafe .
the lamb was humming full with flavor .
not bad for being frozen .
"wow , talk about strong flavors ."
oh yeah ... that sounds real good .
beers can cost $ 0 around the strip .
mixed concoctions can cost $ 00 at the club .
the happy hour applies in both areas .
check out the website and see what i mean .
each month they also have a featured flavor .
definitely not a new york pizza .
i think it ' s pretty damn good .
' ' they work as a team .
both are mild in flavor .
the wife usually orders the raw sea scallops .
this is n't your high end japanese restaurant .
the workers there all seem to be young students .
"last night , i had the <UNK> pork chop ."
i also recommend the <UNK> squid .
"so damn , good ."
i always recommend my friends to go there .
the food looked and smelled incredible .
the meat was pungent and very tender .
the sushi rice is amazing here .
the place is modern w / dark tones decorations .
"plus , i dont see a bbq pit anywhere ."

they have beers that are 00 % alcohol .
it ' s like a shot .
the tandoori chicken was so dry and <UNK> .
i yet have to find my favorite place .
i was truly offended at the comments .
the <UNK> menu is quite extensive .
i think their <UNK> was crap anyway .
the verdict : the <UNK> was completely amazing .
another plus is this place is 00hrs .
its a gigantic window .
no shady business with your food here .
service still seems to be learning the ropes .
so its not attractive here .
i usually order this with <UNK> .
it ' s not the cleanest place .
the place does have a lot of promise .
it is the last eating establishment along restaurant row .
the place is very well lit .
"yeah , simple recipe but damn good dessert ."
the teppanyaki area also was decorated poorly .
"yeah , the name is weird ."
this was even after a major workout .
i ' m always hungry after a workout .
anything will taste good .
the rib tips were just thick pieces of brisket .
also the sauce had no spicy kick at all .
this brought it down to 0 stars .
"so cheap , and well worth it ."
the rooms are nice and clean .
the staff are great and very friendly .
this took place at noon .
get a double order right off the bat !
it ' s not quite worth the money .
the hushpuppies were amazing and the lamb was excellent .
"very good place , surprisingly very distinct indian food ."
i feel like such an idiot .
felt a little scammed .
the staff was friendly and very knowledge .
this place has super bomb food .
the buyers are legit .
awesome this place is awesome .
super good food for good price .
started all with a habanero laced <UNK> .
you should n't be disappointed here .

they close at 0pm .
so plan accordingly to not be disappointed .

great wait staff and casual atmosphere .
over a good time at the blue martini lounge .
the bands are usually pretty good .
one of those businesses with old school integrity .
very secure and clean location with extremely competent people .
"you know , just like a real casino should ."
el cortez is as good as it gets ... !
highly recommend this place to anyone in the area .
mazda does not stand behind their product .
ta da ! ! only $ 00.00 plus tip .
like a generic pizza .
"do not get their namesake , tamales !"
"dry dry dry , tough meat and little flavor ."
pork shoulder was $ 0.00 lb .
/ $ 0.00 lb .
some tvs scattered through out the dining area .
came here specifically for kimchi and bought 0 jars .
that ' s where the good stopped .
' ' quality and quantity suffers greatly here .
nothing remotely japanese at kabuki only the name !
almost drove right by .
complete and total make over inside and out .
even a new electric sign out front .
i got a 0 piece lunch combo .
"make sure you bring cash though , cash only !"
i will be returning more often cash in hand .
hope you all do the same .
they quit selling fried oysters !
my apologies to the loyal patrons for this <UNK> .
$ 00 - $ 00 including tip .
would i go back to hungry <UNK> ?
old mother in law on sunday .
the 0 wings would not keep a <UNK> aloft .
the sides were ok .
good food and value .
greeted nicely and seated immediately .
i tell it just the way it is .
total for this garbage was over $ 00 .
"you read right , 0 min ."
it ' s no wonder fast food places flourish .
uncle ben would be proud .
parked in covered parking for patient and visitors .
even scheduled my next appt .
got there around 0am .
hidden charges for everything .
for 0 average breakfasts .
nothing really bad but nothing really good either .
probably not coming back .
my son seconds the motion .
could have been much worse !
wrong ! ! ! absolutely identical .
fish fillet was transformed into an 0oz .
nothing seemed to be crispy .
ca n't really cheat on that .
the fried shrimps were outstanding !
disappointed i ate them anyways .
now fast forward to the present .
0 stars for the food being hot and convenient .
sounded like a brick when it landed !
some parts i could actually see through .
it was thinner than mcd ' s .
please come further west .
good brick oven pizza .
ingredients very fresh and tasty .
the only issue i had was with the dryer .
im just gon na say it .
lack of a mood or beat in the place .
i had the catfish and okra .
the iced teas are fresh and tasty as well .
amazing cocktails ... <UNK> burn a real winner .
this new restaurant lives up to the reviews .
the food and service were excellent .
this place is the best gym in phoenix area .

great flavor and <UNK> on the plate .
that is what i was told i needed .
"i received a quote for $ 0,000 . 00 ."
"their quote was $ 0,000 . 00 ."
my unit works really good like it did previously .
the food was really good ... not great .
` ` too much sauce ... ' ' .
"try the night tours , as well ."
but the service i received deserves exposure .
you have a mediocre product .
excellent food every time .
one of our new faves !
do n't fault the restaurant .
the pork was tender and flavorful .
other than that it was a great lunch experience .
this is our fave pei wei in the area .
imo they serve the best gyros around .
we had a traditional gyro and a philly pita .
give it a go .
ordered club sub in a tub .
also ordered a cheesesteak .
thought that meant good things .
hmmmm ... 000 degrees outside .
might try it again ... might not .
grass towards the front is usually quite dead .

<UNK> would be a five star for example .
location : very unique up on small mountain side .
service : very good .
i ordered the rib eye .
would i come back : unlikely .
i go to the location on ray .
car always comes out clean .
they hand scrub each car which is unique .

what more can you ask for ?
they said tough luck .
$ 00 for a caesar ?

menu is large so pretty much can find something .
kind of a local version of the pink taco .
ca n't be missed if this is your thing .
what else can you ask for ?
"once you get on that elevator , everything changes ."
the elevator was very shaky .
rip sahara i ' ll miss you .
i have n't slept this good in <UNK> .

- rrb - under both sinks .

everyone had waits in excess of 0 hours .
my filet and the grilled vegetables were good .
i order the filet and lobster tail .
he quickly returned with a loaf .
the key lime pie was terrific .
a spot to become a regular .
most bad reviews seem to be about expense .

love samantha and the hot guy jorge .
<UNK> burger is aces .
this place was really good .
i had the bbq ribs special .

i enjoy coming here and trying new things everytime .
figure out a better layout more conducive to seating .
the miso cod is amazing and always fresh .
this is their only weakness .
hope this helps ... .

update on previous review .
the pizza is great .
i was there on 0/00 .
the staff is always very helpful and <UNK> .
this is a classic old school bar .
stick it to <UNK> and tasteless fast food establishments !

good <UNK> spot before hitting the more expensive bars
"a 0.0 , rounding down ."
the staff deserve some stars .
like a cheap motel .
it ' s a joke .

people bumpin ' and <UNK> ' short line .
"off strip , but still epic ."

perfect place for lunch or a quick dinner .
food is perfectly priced .
staff and owner very friendly .

it ' s a better than average burger joint .
the fries are usually well done .

decent brew pub food .
and so continues the quest .
best taste and by far most authentic around .
i ' ll begin with the waitress .

the food is mediocre at best .
i had the <UNK> burger and it was excellent .
avoid this place at all costs !

"nah , not really ."
i think you get the idea .
i ' m a fan .
the hot sauce needs work .
overall worth the trip .
i ' ve been here a few times .
more like i ' ve experienced in mexico .
all on one tasting menu .
the place has an awesome vibe .
"lastly , the atmosphere is great here ."
service was also top notch .
this place is good for just about any occasion .
highly recommended ... you wo n't be disappointed .
$ 000 / room per night .
great shop build out and awesome atmosphere .

the combination was delicious and satisfying .
the broth was tasty and the seafood fresh .
"that said , it ' s a steak house ."
- rrb - excellent service 0 .

everything i eat here is amazing .
probably the best dive bar in tempe .
"cheap prices , great artists , and friendly environment ."
just got back from frozen fury .
they have free shuttles to the strip .
and penn & teller perform there .
want your ac maintenance or checked ?
good work and great price .

duke ended up beating wisconsin .
my wife loves thier food .
however they were the size of a little dumpling .
sausage was dry with no flavor .

"kudos for that , tip just went up ."

had the halibut 0 nights with spinach and broccolini .
liquid deli is right .

it ' s very good sushi .

the gym is always pristine and bright .

everything you need for art and great people .
it ' s still there today .
never been to roman ' s ?
do you remember <UNK> ' s from urban cowboy ?
this is nascar country !
"great food , great price ."
<UNK> college is good .
. and boy am i glad i did .
. 0 to be almost free of pain .
. the same principle they use applies in opposite .
they offer discounted rates in groupon now .
. can i help ?
that a bond of professionalism and expectation was broken .
the 0 bowl option is still expensive regardless .
that is something of note .
awesome burgers and new york fries .
this is real nice restaurant quality .
definitely in a different league than fast-food restaurants .
probably my favourite restaurant hamburgers .
the food is great .
wish they still had the lobster .
tony is the man .
this place is awesome .

the regrets of youth .
phenomenal creamy smoked salmon pasta .

i am glad they still use the paper system .
the steak was perfect .
not like the shredded nonsense at subway .
the sandwich was incredible .
"dang it , vincent !"
thinking of bringing 0 people here ?
just go buy a bbq instead .
there ' s no way .
you finally win me back with your phenomenal pancakes .
"mel ' s , pls ."
"slow , inaccurate service and the food tastes bad ."
a few things to keep in mind .
best vietnamese food in <UNK> .
"this place serves , by far , my favourite ."
sometimes there can be a long wait though .
the food is n't really that great .
it does n't hit decent .
the exception is montana ' s .
there has been some cool stuff over the years .
' ' and avoid that guy .
so ... i ordered the large steak burrito bowl .
the gravy was not replaced .
enter this establishment at you <UNK> .
my favourite chinese food in waterloo .
not all subway restaurants are created equal .
i ' d been to sushi 00 maybe twice ?
yeah ... i just walked out of the establishment .
this supremely elevated my confidence in this place .
a gold star for this .
the butter chicken was awesome !
"' ' now , i know nobody likes change ."
but the old wing special gave me 00 wings .
this just means the wings are finally affordable .
this place has always been good to me .
"so , go ahead ."
<UNK> ' s is good people .
ignore anything bad i ever said .
hot + 0 lbs .
"actually , you can rent out the basement right ?"
the beef was kind of dry .
i wonder how much that is on its own ?
that must have been like 0000 .
the economy is <UNK> .
premium prices for the most <UNK> products .
edit : this just in .
overall it was great .
i was referred by a friend of mine .
worth giving it a shot .
the food was excellent !
ruins the ambiance of eating there .
great place to get your car repaired .
friendly people and affordable service .
a lot of fun for a little money .
ok at best is being nice ... .
wait staff was attentive .
"tons of food , well worth the price ."

the scotch menu needs some serious revamping .
holstein shake and bun was a tremendously good meal .

this place is horrible .
0/0 price burgers on saturday that are unbeatable .
the food was excellent .
"however , they need to improve their service ."
very disappointing for thomas keller .

an all-around great dining experience .
once again a good experience .
that ' s what i call service .
korean food in chicago ?
dat do n't make sense .

the views are nice though .
i have been twice now with my wife .

she sent me to anthony 0nd in line .
beast breakfast place i have ever eaten at .

"good food , excellent service , and nice atmosphere ."
"moist , tender , and full of flavor ."
it is really authentic thai food that taste amazing .

i would come back here without thinking twice .
surprised with the entire experience .
"there are no resort fees , no smoking ."
the rooms are very nice .
the views are amazing .
we had views facing mgm grand and the aria .
crust is as tasty as a <UNK> .
the tacos are very good too .
beers 0 for 0.00 !
this place is just enjoyable .
this is a kick ass punk rock bar !
make this place somewhere you regular hit for breakfast .
they only used a <UNK> to clean the table .
the salad was cool .
for me the best was the berries and cream .
the salsa is legit .
good portion but you will need water .
by the ron is awesome .
"man , is this place solid ."
go check this place out .
simply put and nothing else to say .
"yea , highly impressed ."
knocks most places out of the park .
the photos big this place justice .
slap me and call me susan .
i was blown away .
the gesture that is .
"well , yeah , that ' s just it ."
strike one and two .
non dietary restriction friendly .
apple n greens is pretty darn tasty .
"the stadium is cool , like super cool ."
that is not the issue .
"oops , my bad ."

great family ran business .
go there for great food and delicious coffee .
most honest shop on town .
serving the valley since the 00 ' s .

i use the drive through .
the chimichangas are great .
another great oregano ' s opened in the valley .

"oh wait , fair prices ."
staffed with friendly and knowledgeable people .
"oh wait , most importantly practice is awesome ."
"great guy , that i ca n't recommend enough ."
it looked like shit !
. what can you do right ?
awesome bar with a great beer selection .
best chimichangas in phx .
but do n't have any ideas about the <UNK> .
great food and a wonderful family run business .
best tortillas in az is not a slogan .
it ' s the truth .
it ' s worth the trip every time .
great place to enjoy a great az day
average calzones for an average cost .
make sure you set an appointment .
top gear is playing on the tv !
you just ca n't beat the lunch special .
i had the chicken entree with no expectation .
i ' m looking forward to going back .
<UNK> is top notch !
this is not acceptable when a company does wrong .
they were both outstanding !
the drunken noodles were equally tasty .
perfect combination of traditional and modern coffee decor .
what a great find in the desert .
had a great experience over at mattress firm .
dave was very knowledgeable and accommodating .
some are personal preferences .
i thought the smoke level was really quite good .
the pulled pork was very dry .
i think the rub is ok .
they might consider a fattier st louis style rib .
i did n't like the chili powder <UNK> either .
"the meats are masterfully prepared , tender and juicy ."
the beans are inedible to me .
the slaw is perfect .
i liked the pulled pork a lot .
the ribs are heavily smoked .
the breads are inspired .
organic and made without commercial yeast .
this is a must try .
i tried the lamb burger .
my wife ordered a falafel plate .
i felt the same about my gyro .
the fries were great .
<UNK> helped me out and i did finish them .
this place is a treasure .
i could write a novel about this terrible evening .
it was just one bad after another .
you all know what ' s coming next right ?
nothing was <UNK> about any of this .
can i go back to chicago now ?
i will sum it up like this .
their 0 red sauces contain high fructose corn syrup .
i ordered the small bit a food combo .
neither of which list corn syrup on the bottles .
0/0 for the ribs .
"again , the seasonings complement the main ingredients ."
i started with a really good house cocktail .
seems everywhere i do there ' s a rendition .
decaf is very good .
this is less a bar than a hotel lobby .
they forgot my wife ' s garnish as well .
it should have been unbelievable for $ 00 .
this is the 0nd time i have been here .
the service has been pretty good .
it should just taste more like beans and andouille .
the last few times has bordered on inedible .
i am there for the food .
it just is n't done this way .
neither of which this place makes on their own .
the staff is terrific .
overall the value was borderline .
the staff is always well trained .
the menu offers many options .
it ' s a tough thing to do .
this is the best indian buffet in pittsburgh .
there ' s a definite range .
"tamarind , for example , is just hot ."
every dish is too hot .
this place does not pass as a restaurant .
this is an awful place to get a meal .
i was a victim of peer choices .
the winner here was the pulled pork for me .
the ribs were pretty good .
i liked the rub .
i liked the place and the service was excellent .
racks of stuff coming in and out .
the prepared foods look good .
i tried a chicken wing and it was ok .
the dry rub ribs were ok too .
i really like a great peruvian chicken joint .
this one is ok .
the ribs and pork have a nice dry rub .
burnt is n't good food .
the greens were spot on .
the place is n't much to look at .
i would come back for a cheap show .
maybe a little high for the cuisine .
i did see a microwave and assumed the worst .
microwaves take the <UNK> right out of your food .
where was the onion and garlic ?
the 0 bagels and cream cheese were $ 0 .
this should definitely stay on the menu .
some good some bad .
more poor pittsburgh area <UNK> and design .
another winner in pittsburgh ?
"creative , interesting and well executed ."
you can dine inside or out .
the place was really busy on a sunday .
southern food is my weak spot .
i ordered the fried chicken dinner with 0 sides .
none are quite enough .
i opted for the leg and thigh .
the staff is warm and friendly .
he ' s a holistic practitioner .
"the greens were good , solid but nothing special ."
the corn bread was perfect .
it ' s a familiar tale .
the first was a special .
"would have been nicer , hotter ."
interesting dish but lacked balance .
the chips were stale and oversalted .
the flour tortilla was pretty nice .
the lack of effort and interest here was astounding .
was this from the pico ?
the counter person asked me if i wanted everything .
this dish was almost inedible .
my wife had the artichoke salad .
another second rate pittsburgh restaurant .
the chicken is crispy and nicely seasoned .
0 star ribs and 0 star beans .
i ordered the rough chopped pork .
"mostly moist , tender , delicious ."
nice smoke and porky flavor .
i would n't order the ribs .
i had the red slaw .
i ' ll bet the brisket is good .
very nice home and grounds .
can you say <UNK> flood ?
how about the homestead strike ?
my tacos were very nicely prepared .
the corn tortillas were very good .
i had the barbacoa and the chicken mole tacos .
the staff is friendly and service is very good .
the focaccia is ok .
i really liked the chicken and the confit leg .
i ordered a 0/0 rack of ribs .
i left a little hungry actually .
"as for now , pretty good ."
the mayo was nice but could be lighter .
the service was very good .
the place was freezing yesterday .
the plates were cold making the food cold .
the food is mostly very tasty and well prepared .
i would come here more often .
i sprinkled some oregano over and it was great .
a new thai restaurant in the south hills ?
the duck was very good .
the portion was very good .
i ' ve had this a few different ways .
threw it in the trash .
the quality is good here .
a place to go for good food at montreal
the service is impeccable and the food is fantastic .
chris a . is 000 % correct .
the staff is great and prices are very reasonable .
would not recommend this place to an enemy .
like something is rotting somewhere .
mccarran continues to improve on an already great start .
the prices continue to be reasonable .
nice people work here .
"cheap , fast and awesome ."
then i stayed here .
the real surprise was the staff .
"great food , wonderful staff , cool surroundings ."
the sever was top notch .
"i ' ve been , a few times ."
try to compare prices on their various offerings .
did i say try to actually book a room ?
the selection is kind of funky .
the prices are ok .
their sales are pretty good .
"the produce is marginal , at best ."
"the rooms are nice , but <UNK> ."
only the layout differs .
the other furniture is nice .
"the views , they do n't exist ."
i ' m not saying my stay was bad .
they have a fantastic bakery .
not speaking french was n't much of <UNK> .
i was there with my wife and three friends .
once things got started the pace was much better .
the drinks were excellent .
the sheets had holes in them .
<UNK> what they claim carefully .
these rooms used to be nice .
that ' s not a complaint .
"in the end , avoid the flamingo ."
that will never change unless they demo the place .
let that sink in .
i ' m still a strip guy .
two free checked bags is a good thing .
the staff was excellent .
a better than average marshall ' s .
nice convenience store with a decent soda fountain .
i ' ll use hertz again .
cheers to hertz for a great rental system .
"as always , awesome ."
did i say it was busy ?
the food is outstanding .
"i mean , outstanding ."
the burgers are legendary .
the atmosphere here is ok .
"not bad , not exciting ."
"and then the big <UNK> , the steak ."
standard michael ' s store .
i dont need to explain why .
by far the worst casino on the strip .
my recommendation is to stay anywhere but here .
do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else .
larry <UNK> is awesome .
highly recommend this parts department because of larry .
"no more , double wide grill ."
not a bad bar at all .
probably would just stick to apps .
this place should never get a bad rap .
i ordered scrambled eggs but was brought over-easy .
it was corrected and brought back .
the coffee was warm but far from hot .
the next cup was much better .
not much else to say about it .
"the whole block is worth <UNK> , thou ."
"finally , the menu looks more interesting that ayce ."
the attitude of the guy really pissed me off .
the annoying guy is the assistant manager or manager .
i needed some suites for every day work .
guess this is not my place .
"one for lunch , the other for breakfast ."
had the french dip sandwich and monterey omelette .
"service was very friendly , thou ."
the butter muffin was very good .
both are top notch .
they are located in different parts of the city .
fukumimi can not be missed in east lv .
the general atmosphere is quite relaxed .
the focus is the place not the product .
"dont get me wrong , the place is ok ."
slow service and average food .
good for the money .
great location inside the cosmopolitan .
"overall , great dining experience !"
i specially like tom kha and beef noodle soup .
went to joe s with my <UNK> © .
"ill be back this sunday , cant wait !"
"seriously , im getting addicted to this place ."
service is quick and friendly .
one of the best japanese restaurants in lv .
a gem near china town .
everything is high quality an meticulously crafted .
try <UNK> as appetizer .
their new location is light years better .
the food is also pretty consistent .
tom kha kai is well made and seasoned .
same goes for curries and fried rice .
"the place is small , noisy and hot ."
beverages are very are well crafted .
you kinda get hooked with this place .
no one can mess up a nova lox sandwich .
this was our first el restaurant .
everything tasted ` ` fatty ' ' .
"good experience , good restaurant ."
the menu is quite diverse .
this is my favorite jd location .
what really makes the difference is the staff .
place is clean and food quality is consistent .
nigiri menu was spot on .
but really enjoyed every plate and the overall experience .
best place for breakfast and brunch outside the strip .
perfect for a nice sunday breakfast .
great quality products and affordable prices .
i wish there was a <UNK> in the southwest .
"crawfish is overrated , thou ."
this place is fun and delicious .
"the service was kind of slow , thou ."
i hate going to t-mobile stores .
there are few toppings or add ons .
you can also request brown rice as a side .
add <UNK> to the list .
"not good , not particularly bad either ."
the place is ok for an office meal .
"the staff is very friendly , thou ."
update : went for lunch today .
especially with the high ratings in yelp .
the sauce - lrb - hollandaise ?
ill stay with <UNK> .
you can get all your standard bagels .
hash corned beef is very good .
"place is way too small , thou ."
i really prefer the one at fort apache .
"coffee was very good , pastry was ok ."
"overall , its a fine place ."
i had a capastrami sandwich today .
i was shocked at how good this place is .
management is doing a great job .
very good mexican restaurant .
by far the best ive been in vegas .
update : i went back on <UNK> 0000 .
it was very very good .
one can not go wrong with spago .
"it does n't get too bad , thou ."
i just recall having a great salmon with risotto .
the place is clean and modern .
great place ! ! ordered the specialities .
it is quite an experience .
i heard that borders is in financial trouble .
the food is ok for the value .
huge portions but nothing out of this world .
expensive for the actual products you get .
also i love the way diana cuts my hair !
and definitely try the alien burrito .
the hand stretched noodle bowls were awesome .
"not horrible , but really not that great either ."
food was mediocre at best and not cheap .
the sushi was great .
ate breakfast here and was very happy .
ribs are not that big for the duo sides .
"the service was awesome , very nice people ."
the food was awesome .
all of them were just awesome .
this place was fantastic !
the lasagna almost melts in your mouth .
i had the sandwich with prosciutto and mozzarella .
both were very good .
very good and tasted very fresh .
i ordered the sliders ... worst mistake .
"mine were medium-well , closer to well ."
i had a great experience here .
they have a nice selection of house brews .
"this thing was huge , easily 00-00 ' ' ."
a great interpretation of a ny crust .
"small cozy place , only 00 tables ."
"friendly staff , wide selection of hookah flavours ."
nice place to <UNK> .
setup of the club is on another level .
for guys it ' s pretty hard .
this went on for a good 00 minutes .
las vegas police department showed up .
the work with valets to rip off the tourists .
not many places have lived up to the hype .
hash house a go go did no wrong though .
both are very good to eat .
the larger area does help buffer those distractions though .
not a very good dining experience .
not a very good dining experience .
"no explanation , no apology ."
i think i ' ll take his advice .
excellent experience with avondale garage door .
very simple issue ... .
i stood next to the gentleman .
they do n't deserve your money .
you have nothing to loose !
i could keep going .
this place is awesome .
all in all a great buying experience .
overpriced crap from mexico mostly .
went there today and got a new <UNK> <UNK> .
great service as well .
never ever heard this in a restaurant before .
had the french onion soup starter .
hey wait ... potatoes showed up .
0nd : the service .
the service is really a one star rating .
no could i get a refill on my water ?
no was there a smiling face in the place ?
i went to this place today morning .
giving a haircut is an art .
"waitstaff was friendly , prompt , and efficient ."
she could n't understand or communicate effectively in english .
amazing food and atmosphere .
meats are fresh and well prepared .
<UNK> pibil is phenomenal .
very friendly and inviting staff .
stay away from this one .
i got a two piece white with two sides .
its a restaurant with a lot of character .
how awsome is that .
the staff is cool and pretty relaxed .
the service is fast and the food is ok .
try the make and cheese and the fried chicken .
the stew beef is also pretty good .
this is a great chinese resturant .
it was also dry as a chip .
you will not be let down .
in my opinion that perfectly describes this sham restaurant .
you should <UNK> try it at least once .
"i ordered the wings , ribs , and wings ."
the apricot bbq sauce was out of this world .
the wings were jerk seasoned and ok at best .
the food portions were adequate and tasted delicious .
everything this places advertises on it delivers .

"go here , and you will not be disappointed ."
huge seating capacity as well .
exactly what is needed in this particularly location .
great bread baskets too .
i would get this steak again in a heartbeat .
"so yeah , a solid meal ."
there are plenty of great steakhouses in vegas though .
"still , it ' s not without its charm ."
not for this guy .
the very definition of an average brunch .
the toast is thick cut and deliciously buttered .
otherwise they would have a new best customer .
the juiciness of the meat is perfect .
the salty flavor addition from the bone is perfect .
the calamari is solid as well .
"creamy delicious inside , perfect fluffy crust ."
everything is done real well here .
keep your <UNK> about you .
very solid all around .
not very authentic but will do for charlotte .
ordered the steak and had the tuna as starter .

crunchy casing and juicy as hell .
"now , on to the steaks ."
the recommendation on the taster was spot on .
i will start with the two sauces offered .
"one is a tomatillo based , spicy salsa ."
on to the main show .
"- rrb - , and all have been sublime ."
"finally , the mains ."
what else is there to say ?
i can not recommend this place enough .
corn pancakes - order as many as you can .
ribs - tender ... check .
and definitely get the mimosa / champagne upgrade .
only an idiot would say no .
authentic east coast style pizza joint ?
the chimichurri sauce is that damn good .
you have to try other things .
the music is a good balance .
the drinks do the deed .
it is an <UNK> and a <UNK> !
my experience had both positive and negative aspects .
positive : nice layout on the rooftop area .
negative : the rooftop area closes at 0am ?
negative : music is gear towards an older crowd .
"soo , hello again ."
the truffle mac n ' cheese disappeared ... fast .
combined with the onion jam and the toast points .
"if anything , get some 0am fries ."
firefly definitely falls on that list for me .
this is a deceptively complex dish exploding with flavor .
the sauce on this dish is <UNK> good .
what else is there to know ?
kyara is an experience that you must try .
another vegas exploration success !
the first thing you notice is the decor .
the pesto torte is a must item .
"the cheese , crackers and pesto are <UNK> good ."
"hands downs , some delicious chicken and waffles ."
"on sandwiches , i am 0 for 0 here ."
i will go from worst to best .
the fish sandwich ... .
the fish was super fresh and lightly breaded .
check out rm for lunch .
they come highly recommended by me .
bad bad bad bad bad ... .
after a quick yelp search i found this place .
i feel its average bar food .
my wife had the pesto chicken sandwich .
ray ray creates and serves the best drinks .

food was pretty good .
service was very good .
had dinner here one evening .
food came out in about 00 minutes or so .

hair in cole slaw .
staff takes time out to talk with the customers .
the new location on 00th street is awesome .
complete opposite of the previous .
i may have a problem .
". instead , i got omelet which was great ."
some truly exciting moments .
the projection is a bit blurry and low quality .
i had a yelp review intervention tonight .
skip the grilled tomatoes .
the omelet was cooked to perfection .
"it was served hot , light and fluffy ."
this places motto should be it tastes like <UNK> .
plenty of tvs to watch the games on .
i made my wife into a pho expert .
the following is her comment .
foot long <UNK> mi with the <UNK> ' .
i come here for their traditional plates .
all very distinctly subtle with brazilian spices .
always full of brazilian ppl .
scallop 00 point tasty .
cole slaw is very good and not slimy .
fifth time here now .
forgot to bring ice coffee until end of meal .
all proteins super lean .
i have the bison and elk bowl there now .
better than greens and proteins up the street .
my wife is from greece .
this is the place .
the gyros are perfect .
<UNK> out my two tips on this place .
you will not find pork here .
this is a real chinese <UNK> restaurant .
service is above chinese typical .
they will help you .
it ' s almost like a trick question .
"smoothies , yes ; very good ."
roasted veggies ; excellent .
five stars for sure .
my tomato and shrimp bisque was outstanding .
best donuts in this city .
best donuts i ' ve had anywhere .
but nice people and ok food .
i had the pork loin .
"excellent mexican food , good service , comfortable surroundings ."
outstanding in every way .
this place will be a regular stop for me .
the equipment selection is vast and well-maintained .
"clean , bright place with very good service ."
i strongly recommend <UNK> <UNK> photography .
this is quite a find .
i strongly recommend it .
it is simply outstanding in every way .
"the drivers were courteous , friendly , and competent ."
and the technology was flawlessly simple .
ribs wee very good .
sides were pretty good .
definitely more <UNK> than taste .
"bad price , sub-par food , but ok service ."
americas best value inn lived up to its promise .
"the room was clean , and functional ."
nothing you would n't hope for from vegas .
"had the gargantuan , awesome sandwich !"
i had the huevos rancheros burrito which was <UNK> .
maybe that ' s the problem .
good luck in africa though !
nobody likes shopping and feeling criminal for doing it .
"dip it in ranch , awesome !"
"it was ok , kinda bland but not bad ."
"not bad , not great ."
"the paella however , fell flat ."
best sandwiches i ' ve had in town yet .
"the food is good enough , nothing spectacular ."
i found the service here is actually very good .
"- rrb - , tasted well enough ."
best japanese i ' ve had in vegas yet .
00 bucks down the drain .

"the coffee was also great , bold and fresh ."

0.00 steak and eggs .
"bartender served me , nice guy ."
watch out for <UNK> bikers though .
"now , the actual sushi ."
all of this for less than seven bucks .
their orange chicken is great !
spring rolls and peanut sauce were awesome as well .
pro : free blues night saturday .
con : $ 00 for halibut pasta special .
service is unusually good here .
what a bunch of idiots .
only $ 00 for the honor .
that ' s when things started to get better .
coffee cake alone is enough reason to come here .
they also have an excellent selection of produce .
somebody definitely thought about its construction .
so which one do you go with ?
"they are cash only , so come prepared ."
definitely coming back here frequently .
what happened to the special of the day ?
"everybody likes the surprise inside , remember cracker jack ?"
still some issues at the front of the house .
"finally , i <UNK> and go with the <UNK> ."
all of this for less than nine bucks !
"the room price was ok , 000 i believe ."
they should be under five dollars .
"you put this together , you will make money ."
that ' s at least my first impression .
cosmo will certainly earn a fifth star upon <UNK> .
excellent selection of craft beer too .
he is an excellent example of a professional employee .
worse apartments for the same amount of money .
bad service and mediocre food served cold .
the inside is small with my a dozen seats .
"skip this place , no really , skip it ."
they were surprisingly cool with that .
"beautiful casino , but no poker room ."
the food and service are always excellent .
boa is a bad joke .
"thus , 0 stars ."
too much work for these guys .
keep up the good work .
what happened to getting stock in before completely out ?
that is costing walmart $ $ .
the managers could n't care less .
"the fries are ok , just a bit bland ."
in the valley in general .
this place is a joke .
no fucking reason to do what that nurse did .
they have to put it on the sandwich .
"the rooms , particularly the bathrooms , are spectacular ."
the casino is a responsible size and very friendly .
the crowd is a mix of retirees and <UNK> .
the prices are outstanding .
the selection is epic .
donovan ' s on camelback is 000 times better .
marsala sauce looked like bbq sauce .
the food is well worth the wait .
this almost made me hate starbucks as a whole .
the worst car wash spot in all az . .
just brought my brand new x0 to get washed .
no upgrades to synthetic or anything .
fuck this place again .
anyhow this place is awesome from service to food .
they make the experience ten times better .
their appetizers are unique creations .
. it ' s goes great with the food !
i had more than my fair share .
"what to say , what to <UNK> ."
a journey into a wondrous land of imagination .
"next stop , the twilight zone !"
"oh wait , blue man group ."
then more sound and illusion with these giant ipads .
crunchy on the outside moist on the in .
"http://url steamed mussels - moist , tender , succulent ."
ever see that movie ` ` <UNK> ' ' ?
or ` ` the road warrior ' ' ?
' ' that ' s not the case here .
i even spotted a <UNK> .
because it certainly is .
but your on the vegas strip .
$ 00 for one or $ 00 for two .
cheap cheap and very tasty .
the time intervals between ordering seemed to be decent .
i ca n't even say enough about the meats .
"they also serve chicken , pork and lamb options ."
the service here is flawless .
everyone is treated equally special .
i recommend staying away from the salads .
it almost feels like its a double wide trailer .
they have a big menu .
take my money i ' m out .
this was a really great bargain .
the room was not cleaned .
the rooms were nice but basic .
no microwave oven or refrigerator .
here is where you can get the hotel wifi .
the casino was pretty typical .
the blue man group performs here .
"curious , i went inside ."
the decor is of course ultra modern .
"what happens in vegas , stays in vegas ."
very little duck meat .
offering us some recommendations and chatting us up .
and i finished the bowl and licked it clean .
all from the the <UNK> company .
the macaroon was dope .
"all in all , pretty tasty but kinda pricy ."
tries hard but ultimately fails in luxury .
the touch screen is nice but fairly gimmicky .
$ 00 for internet <UNK> ?
~ $ 00.0 pp including <UNK> of 00 % .
as far as food goes .
just use their parking lot .
"came out after having lunch , car was booted ."
"very nice board game shop , growing in size ."
free wifi as well .
at the north end of the strip mall .
"our waitress , mary , was top notch ."
this place knows how to do breakfast .
great place to meet interesting folks from all over .
the epitome of a hearty meal .
service was attentive and spot on .
i am a satisfied customer .

the fish was fresh and lightly seasoned .
the sea bass and clean and buttery .
on top were deep friend garlic flakes .
a quick snap from the pickled onions .
great beer selection from many craft brewers .
"great menu , brick oven pizza , great service ."
good for pre or post theater or ball game .
"great value here , and great food ."
vegetarian and halal plates are available .
the drive is decently far from the strip .
you win some you lose some .
my wife enjoyed her torta .
"the service was friendly , i rushed ."
dont waste your time and money here .
probably good food if you are drunk or something .
you will not be disappointed .
this is sad and unfortunate .
"this place has a really clean , modern atmosphere ."
it ' s not that type of joint .
drinks are better than average for madison too .
yummy selection of german beers .
never been here for the food .
sell that stuff in the appropriate setting .
absolute favorite breakfast place in phoenix .
ca n't give this place enough credit .
they could definitely pick up the speed .
"praise publicly , <UNK> in private ."
go to moore jeep and talk to mitchell .
"good for you , yes ."
why does this place not have a / c ?
service was ridiculously good .
this place is pricey ... but really good .
the service here does suck though .
' ' what kind of crap is that ?
they taste great though .
my wife had the jambalaya .
she orders cheeseburgers with just cheese and ketchup .
not a bad gym .
i ' ll update the longer we go .
seems clean to me .
this is now la fitness .
discount tire never let ' s me down .
"go here , they are the best ."
this spot hit it for sure .
"quick service , poor quality ."
i come here for small appliances and floor cleaners .
". food was just ok , nothing special ."
set an appointment for 0:00 the next morning .
so i wanted a 0rd quote .
i build wood furniture and cabinets .
typical small asian food store .
"also , worst happy hour specials ."
"just be honest , i said no rush anyway ."
who carries cash nowadays ?
but the color contrasted the black boot .
the finishing on it is amateur .
"why these boots came out worse , who knows ."
service was slow and underwhelming as well .
nothing we ate was all that good .
that seemed to be the crowd here anyway .
steak : very good .
fried pickles were better than expected .
the 00 cent of <UNK> ' .
a diamond in the rough of dive bars .
best bar in lawrenceville .
i got ta say donnie makes you feel welcome .
during steeler games this place is crazy .
from start to finish they were fantastic !
so maybe the lunch fare is better .
very nice restaurant and bar .
great owner and the staff is very attentive .
the food and drink are above your average bar .
. try <UNK> and you will like this place .

the menu is great .
reasonable full price items .

you ca n't go wrong with any of them .
the ding ding cake is unbelievable .
all the deserts are home made .
this time i got the philly cheese steak pizza .
this place is great .
they created the penny beer / wine special .
their pizza is hand made and to die for .
the burgers are always great to .
the world knows about this place .
this is our first time at the smokehouse .
came here to follow <UNK> .
meat was cooked to order perfectly .
tender as can be .
great bar hang out .
<UNK> always good at cracker barrel .
"very cool , great space , tables well separated ."
i was blown away .
absolutely top notch phenomenal !
"staff and security friendly , restaurants have good food ."
i ' d probably stay here again .
you got ta do it <UNK> palace way folks .
so much for competition .
the buffet at imperial palace is terrible .
the coffee was not even memorable .
"maybe , that was the only ok thing ."
did we need all of that space ?
my girlfriend dish was tasting nothing exceptional .
worst thing is the service .
it look like it was pre-cooked frozen pork .
i enjoy the breakfast and will try lunch soon !
"very nice , well maintained , and secure facility ."
"friendly , helpful office staff and convenient email billing ."
"bottom line , do n't trust them ."
might as well get a new outside unit .
might as well get a new inside unit too .
monday morning the crew shows up .
installation is uneventful until the end .
tuesday morning hector shows up again .
never said a word about it .
i ended up fixing the ceiling myself .
not the slightest savings .
what a complete ripoff .
to request a late checkout ?
to request a <UNK> bed ?
any of these things ?
"the food , simply put , is d'lish ."
the smoked salmon & egg salad tartine was excellent .
the most notable dish ordered was the seafood crepe .
"great atmosphere , great food ."
the place was nearly empty at the time .
this place needs to be a franchise .
delicious <UNK> <UNK> dishes .
keep up the good work guys .
thank you morgan and gardening staff .
what a great restaurant .
the food was excellent but the service was superb .
also had a side of fries that were excellent .
same can be said about the cole slaw .
"a <UNK> , to say the least ."
i knew exactly what i was doing .
pork and guacamole is always a great combo .
i like the lost leaf .
definitely worth the ride out to tempe .
"ahhh , four peaks ."
by far my favorite restaurant in phoenix .
and wow it was great .
"meat was great , sauce was great ."
manger was no help at all .
the service was fast and good .
both dishes were very good and large .
. nothing like the street tacos in mexico .
handicapped access is limited and needs to be addressed .
food was not great but no other choice .
three stars they could improve .
"i had the brisket , and ribs ."
the meat on the ribs was very good .
the brisket way also very good .
draft beer selection is mediocre at best .
great food a true south of the border place .

best mexican food in vegas .
both <UNK> were great delivered hot .
happy hour is the best in town .
the hostess had attitudes .
"way too much breading , hardly any fish ."
huge interior and dance area .
$ 00 seemed reasonable for the day time ticket .
pretty cool experience at a reasonable price .
you ' d be hard pressed to regret it .
dive bar pretty much sums it up .
checked in recently on a saturday night .
great all-around italian ristorante tucked inside the venetian .
decent enough spot for afternoon drinks and apps .
ps solid bar service !
late night ... it ' s a helluva meal .
tried both the mushroom and the white pizza .
"tasty , <UNK> ingredients on both ."
did n't really live up to the hype .
"either way , my half was solid ."
solid mexican food a bit off the beaten path .
the lobster rolls were more than i expected .
guess i ' m an lv strip kinda guy .
then i he acted like a pompous ass .
i agree with the majority of the reviews here .
i go every time i ' m in vegas .
the bone in ribeye is perfected .
we got the tomahawk steak with high expectations .
low and behold it was a huge let down .

does that make sense ?
the food i can definately recommend .
"chicken , horse , and cow watches ."
been looking for a <UNK> pig flashlight ?
here ' s what i can tell you .

this place is smashing ... get the bone marrow .
neither one of us have touched them .
parking can be a bit of an issue .
finally i like the diversity of the menu .
the sauces again made the pork much better .
this was the kiss of death .
poor service is a reflection of leadership and training .
"as for the food , the sauces made it ."

i see why <UNK> is so popular .
"i write this just after <UNK> , <UNK> 0000 ."

steeler burrito was delicious .
"very helpful , they tailored my suit quickly ."
and it was great .

and unexpectedly deep fried .
"tasteless , fried , crap in enormous amounts ."
maybe we will come back for the next eclipse .
. but not for the food .
it was very good .
overall a very good place .
airport food at a new low .
"but , they have beer and sports ."
the worse hair cut ever .
now the rest small loud place .
i had breakfast here and it was very good .
the omelet was huge and very tasty .

i promise you wo n't regret it .
why do i rate this place so highly ?
best bacon i have ever had in my life .
their pressed juices are also great .
but the tint quality and darkness was perfect .
cactus crossfit staff is top notch .
they are the primary reason i ' ve stayed .
honest sandwiches with fresh ingredients .
outstanding sweet potato fries .
fresh honest and quick food at a fair price .
the smoked salmon commuter sandwich is outstanding .
a run of the mill upscale sushi restaurant .
a fantastic little cafe in the bustling biltmore complex .
avoid the taro milk tea .
a trendy burger shop in the biltmore mall .
"nevertheless , the atmosphere once you enter is wonderful ."
the barista was very friendly .
ridiculous behavior in a sad time .
guys and gals this is a bar in disguise .
the sandwich was very good .
"not excellent , but very good ."
"well , quite different , as it turns out ."
cucina far exceeded my expectations in every way .
i ' ll keep this short .
this place did not let me down .

on the southside where i lived .
and big dog coffee .
large room service 00 hour menu .
decked out with a clover to boot .
` ` i need some air .
"a real breath of fresh air , this place ."
one pastrami sandwich please .
' ' come on now ... live a little .
"and , really , this <UNK> is cheap !"
fat head ' s sure does n't .
- rrb - they have bear republic on tap .
embrace the heat of the wings .
embrace what local joints in pittsburgh have to offer .
and they even provide scooter tours of the city .
wine list is smart but not overly extensive .
great food and superb ambiance .
many are most likely glad for this .
the consol energy center lacks character simply put .
the vantage points are great .
the food is too expensive .
$ 0 for a personal pizza ?
$ 0 for nachos ?
this is the best steakhouse in pittsburgh .
their kona rubbed steaks are phenomenal .
my favourite restaurant on the west island .
the drinks arrived at the table .
the pho here was pretty darn bad .
so stumbling into this place ' s a blessing .
my 0st experience there ' s funny .
the burger as a whole ' s pretty good .
conclusion : the burger ' s pretty good .
my wife and i love this place .
the burger patty was <UNK> tender .
excellent <UNK> outside the city center of las vegas .
the decoration could be better and offer more charm .
no offer of coffee top up .

phoenix arizona was one of our favs .
they have very clean cars & professional drivers .
"hands down , the best donuts i have had ."
"taste and service is excellent , be back there ."
as we were eating we did not speak .
the food is quite pricy considering what is served .
all in all great experience but again overpriced .
the production value here is high .
"oh , and the gambling is cheap !"
did not get seated until almost 00 .
the reason why could be the slow service .
with a line outside the door thats unacceptable .
the mandarin beef stew noodle was good .
the signature premiere rice hit the spot for me .
in general the food was of quality was delicious .
the burger was good .
the shake was amazing .
the food is always solid .
great place for an evening dinner and people watching .
service was excellent as to be expected .
the menu is very simple .

the food continues to carry that confident theme .
i had the brisket and meatball pho for reference .
ask for the sauces tho as they might forget .
not the case here .
plenty of killer to the proper amount of filler .
bought the groupon and was impressed by tech adam .
great service and will definitely get it done again .
i go for the traditional gyro with a salad .
nothing too special here .
the <UNK> shake is very good .
0.0 stars in n out being 0.0 stars .
i definitly recommend the sautã © ed chicken .
i saw that beer is coming soon .
this is the best bbq i have ever had .
unique place that has passed the test of time .
it smelled pretty bad as the heat increased .
the food here is excellent .
this is a nice touch .
"the waitstaff was unimpressive , as well ."
"in addition , the atmosphere was pretty weak ."
we ordered the shortrib and the ribeye .
there was absolutely no flexibility with this arrangement .
budget just lost a customer for good .
ok - that ' s a minor thing .
nice little story book coffee shop on the hill .
in fact everybody in my group hated it .
where are the circus acrobatics ?
they certainly give you quantity over quality here .
the fish is flawlessly fresh and flavorful .
dinner is just $ 0 .
the chicken was dry and fair tasting .
not a great example of traditional italian chicken parm .
"pricey , but typical for vegas ."
what happened to cheap eats at the casinos ?
thin crispy crust and top quality italian sausage .
think cinnamon roll only <UNK> out pizza style .
"the atmosphere is nice , modern and clean ."
you will not be disappointed .
who trained this idiot ?
the servers were very attentive to every detail .
"food and service were good , not great ."
makes the price worth it .
the one star deduction was for the service .
"not poor , just average ."

the wife ' s broiled .

i had the <UNK> lamb chops .
the four stars is for the lamb chops .
the baked potato was the size of a football .
this place turned us on to thai food .
strongly recommend el chorro .
"really , what more can u ask for ?"
not a bad thing .
at that point i walked out .
the gyro meat is not gf though .
<UNK> also caters to egg and dairy allergy <UNK> .
there is no <UNK> fryer .
along came a hamburger with lettuce and tomato .
we had the fish tacos and carne asado burrito .
i can think of other places i like better .
the other location is only pickup and delivery .
"that said , this place was great ."
"so far , it is my top in champaign ."
"great rates , impeccable job ."
"great food , great atmosphere ."
usually that is a very very bad sign .
"however , the food was fantastic ."

the food here is fantastic .
the staff has always been great .
"but the food , oh the food ."
did i say it was fantastic ?
my personal favorite is the <UNK> <UNK> .
my wife ' s is the paneer <UNK> masala .
will use for every vehicle here after .
not bad for airport fare .
came with fries dusted with a hint of cheese .
much better than the other fast food choices nearby .
so here ' s the deal .
the desserts were also very good .
had a great lunch there yesterday .
"one cheese , one chicken and one beef ."
all 0 were great .
i give it a 0.0 .
"not bad , but not great ."
everything is well prepared and delicious .
i came here from the recommendation of a friend .
we were rushed very un graciously out the door .
the huge long waits do n't help matters either .
<UNK> con <UNK> sylvia ' s .
what a fool i was .
the knife looks brand new .
until next time shame blanket .
. the pizza here is fantastic .
the interior is pretty cool .
"damn , she got me ."
she had won this battle .
her dish was far superior .
. but they sucked !
they know how to cook shrimp to perfection here .
the service was excellent .
"i mean , think about it for a second ."
"they cook them perfectly , done all the thru ."
props to you guys .
perhaps ill try one of there other sauces ?
then again ... the dozen should probably do .
i had a few fries which were good .
i opened the bun on my burger .
the chorizo was the star here .
all in all this place was a pleasant surprise .
nobody likes to have their car in the shop .
this is nothing more than a flashy dive bar .
breakfast burrito was the best i ' ve had .
this place was great .
you ' ll thank me .
and the chicken strips were literally full-sized chicken breasts .
i ' m not kidding .
man - - these burgers are good .
it ' s a pretty decent hotel and casino .
the style is a bit old and outdated .
great hotel restaurant with a friendly staff
if you like southern barbecue .
this is the right place for you .
i recommend the ribs .

this place started off great .
i come to phoenix once a month for business .
we then got an overall estimate the next day .
will be back again .
my wife and i found stew <UNK> thru yelp !
you will not go wrong with this guy .
let ' s start there .
poor excuse for salsa bar .
"mind you , this is a fast food establishment ."
got quotes from a couple of different contractors .
ultimately decided to go with matt at apollo electric .
"highly , highly recommend using apollo electric ."
i love me some mesquite grilled burgers .
the chuck box does it right !
what an amazing place .
the installation was quick and done right .
these guys are professionals .
total bill was about $ 000 before tip .
five stars just for the beer selection .
location is 0 stars and this place is clean .
i had the gyro and it was above average .
this place is very deceptive .
great little restaurant plenty of choices to choose from .

the police are mindless <UNK> .
the biggest <UNK> fraud in human existence .
it gets no better then this .
texas bbq is all about the sauce .
ride your bike here and relax .
service was slow but friendly .
<UNK> is the epitome of <UNK> .
people read the filtered reviews .
have enjoyed shogun for many years !
my family gives it 0 stars .
the food here is pretty good .
the baked beans are good as well .
the mac & cheese is tasty as well .
the meatloaf was just ok .
that statement is very true in this situation .
it ' s certainly worth the $ 0.00 .
they arrived timely and diagnosed the situation quickly .
"the end result was great , but pricy ."
employees really could n't care less .
they offered me the <UNK> fish for full price .
what a waste of time .
"awesome rooms , practically brand new hotel ."
what the hell is wrong with some people ?
this place made a bad day turn out great .
instantly i felt much better .
great local beer selection as well .
quick lunches and decent prices .
ambiance is a bit to be desired .
i had 0 tires with 00k miles on them .
the turkey was actually frozen .
"food , especially their soups , are very good ."
their membership rates vary depending on your commitment .
this is where the <UNK> sales started .
"awesome selection , but prices are a bit steep ."
my most common best buys ?
this place is amazing .
the bell service helped us out big time .
the wifi ... it was slow .
that is some balls .
i had the bone-in filet and it was delicious .
the curry was good .
the acrobatics and stunts were on another level .
almost all buffets are similar to another in vegas .
there is a lot of variety in this buffet .
but not at le village buffet .
which brings to mention the location .
the pool here is also really something else .
this place was a great place to stay .
there ' s reality and there ' s zumanity .
"that , being mostly the audience involvement ."
' ' we left without further discussion .
the car had no other issues .
my issue with <UNK> is this .
this place is a great dive .
"my wife enjoyed her chimichanga , rice & beans ."
"my enchiladas and rice were ok , nothing special ."
plenty of other mexican restaurants to try .
for phoenix it ' s really good pizza .
it is far better than the national chains .
there was no argument .
that ' s some pretty poor planning .
the portion size was generous .
the sausage was burnt * .
the entire thing was smothered in gravy .
i doubt i ' ll be back anytime soon .
out of drinks and condiments .
the first time i ate here was amazing .
the next two were just as good .
"mixed with some salsa , guacamole and sour cream ."
what an excellent restaurant .
excellent - especially given location and price .
just went here yesterday with my girlfriend .
worth it just due to the service being great .
amazingly fresh and well put together .

the food on another hand was good .
customer service if excellent .
i knew i was going to hate the place .
"one medium rare , one medium ."

that ' s rare in this town .
this place has character .
the dining area could use a little updating .
good luck getting served .
arrived for lunch on sunday .
green chili poutine anyone ?
"smoked , marinated pork with an egg on top ?"
every dish was incredible .
even the hush puppies were uniquely flavored .

and the garbage may be full .
i ' ll continue to be a customer .
i always buy my wood and propane from them .
i ' ll be a life customer .
my wife and i make this place a habit .
jeff & co do it right !
it just did n't stack up .
not worth the 00 bucks we spent .
"from a customer standpoint , you would never know ."
"the toppings were ok , but sloppy and cold ."
the meats were overcooked and way over salted .
the buffalo chicken burrito is really good .
most people are familiar with the new york style .
i wound up at this hotel through <UNK> .
all three burgers where good .
but not great like ive heard .
was not disappointed and will be going back again .
really good value tasty breakfast / brunch .
00 minutes went by and an appetizer arrived .
"it was mediocre , nothing special ."
this sushi was uninspired and bland .
the atmosphere is comfortable .
great place to catch a game .
"if it is a big event , arrive early ."
there is n't a cheap beer on the menu .
mixed reviews on the food .
reminiscent of lord of the flies .
"sure , this bar has all sorts of flaws ."
a lot of the patrons are lame .
cheesy cover band at times .
do n't waste your time .
the wait at the bar was another 00 minutes .
that sentence sums up my recommendation .
"otherwise , do n't waste your time ."
it is called the king toro roll .
"great food , cheap price , great service ."
what more could you ask for ?
"this place features greasy diner food , northeast style ."
the $ 0.00 hibachi chicken special .
an awesome tv and beer .
the salmon was good although slightly undercooked .
the servings were good but not huge .
it did not take away from the meal .

worth trying over the subway craze .
it is enough to feed 0 .
the sides and the sauces were delicious as well .
loved the vinegar slaw and habanero bbq sauce .
they have a very european approach to dinner .
this was by far the best dish we ordered .
it is more about knowing what styles you prefer .
guess it needed more time in the microwave .
great food and cool space .
if you think <UNK> is fresh .
we should have ordered something like a grilled fish .
i had a roast beef .
wash it down with an iron city .
stay away from this pos .
even worse as a magic show .
anything positive you find is inaccurate .
it is as simple as that .

hard to imagine a better burger in las vegas .
"decent , not mind-blowing burger ."
a little expensive for what you get .

not a great setup .
but everything was very good .
nice classy place ; windows face the pool area .
craps tables almost always had $ 00 minimums .

schwartz is usually packed .
significantly overpriced for very ordinary fare .
this is a <UNK> hipster dive bar .
particularly the <UNK> <UNK> .
you ' re not that special .
assuming they do n't just take the tip anyway .

the restaurant itself is fairly casual .
the service was top notch .
"cream mustard , vinegar , horseradish , and cocktail ."
being referred to as an oriental in phx 0 .

"the service , as good as it gets ."
made me a fan for life .
the indoor bocce court is a nice touch .
but these were n't normal circumstances .
how stupid i was not to consult yelp first .
the two stars should tell you everything .
it also cost more than it should .
so for that they get an extra star .
the food is fantastic .
we send these guys quite a bit of business .
they always do a good job .
so back to <UNK> .
consider this place my new source of propane refills .
"thanks dan , we appreciate you ."
i pay for the unlimited washes per month .
other than that this place is great .

this was garbage in it ' s highest form .
amazing they have been in business this long .
the hotel itself is pretty good .
now i knocked them down for two reasons .
just self park and save yourself the hassle .
"it ' s good , but way heavy ."
how can you screw up short ribs ?

luckily someone told me about this place .
food was mediocre at best .
everything about this place is awesome !
"without a doubt , best sandwiches in town !"
- the prime rib was a bit rubbery .
- chocolate covered strawberries were great .
but this is vegas and buffets are numerous .
pie additions cost $ 0.00 each .
he then served beef tongue marinated in miso .
"tender , tasty , absolutely wonderful ."
the rice was a bit underseasoned as well .
so what did they do ?
"these guys make big , tasty , attractive sandwiches ."

nice place over all but nothing special .
over priced but solid coffee and desserts .
the food here is absolutely wonderful .
literally what it ' s advertised as .
"cheap , solid food , no frills ."
as a place to go regularly ?
it ' s flat top .
"but , for what it is ?"
definitely a solid place to go .
primanti bros . is a traditional pittsburgh meal .
stay away from the american <UNK> !
we even opted to do vip bottle service .
but that was a bad idea .
smirnoff and bacardi bottle service ?
aside from the bad experience .
you need to experience this .
and you ca n't complain about $ 0.00 beers !
absolutely nothing wrong with this place .
the best steak ever .
most expensive steak i ' ve bought .
the mexican breakfast was delicious .
"typical courtyard food , overpriced and nothing special ."
great pulled pork sandwich and awesome sweet potato fries .

the third to my surprise was at north italia .
the other reviews are pretty spot on .
this place was amazing .
the fish is very fresh and well prepared .
00 minutes later i had n't moved .
the line for everything else seemed to move faster .
no one left hungry .
worth the drive out of the city .
the sauce is ideally tangy yet not too acidic .
cooked to perfection and top quality ingredients .
food and service was exceptional .
upscale atmosphere with reasonable prices on food and wine .
again service was 0 stars .
why not give it a shot .
do yourself a favor and keep walking .
is there a way to leave a negative rating ?
one of the best kept secrets in sunnyslope !
the cabbage rolls and sauerkraut were excellent as well .
quick look : average sushi and sub-par service .
the busiest part was the bar and patio area .
summary : very solid off strip restaurant .
"both were amazing , very tasty and well presented ."
steaks were right on and cooked perfectly .
little too high priced for an off strip restaurant .
seemed a little excessive for the local driven location .
good job herbs & rye - enjoyed the visit .
too many choices in this city .
the only item up to par was the pancakes .
at this point we just asked for the check .
it was an honest mistake and they corrected it .
especially after reading the other poor reviews online .
i also like the asian beer selection .
mo is a mad man and always working .
- staff politeness needs to improve .
the eastern location has been my gym of choice .
insides of the lockers are also grimy .
this seemed to be a common complaint .
everyone is watching him .
he then proceeds to <UNK> vomit into the pool .
security arrives quickly and starts questioning the man .
i suspect they lost business because of this .
our past couple visits have been sub-par .
had a noticeable energy boost all night .
great staff / convenient location .
never had it and went with their amber beer .
the dishes were large and plentiful .
then tries to hand it to us to eat .
"too bad , because it is reflecting on business ."
both pizzas were tossed in the garbage .
first impression was positive .
he still went ahead and fired it .
guess that should have tipped us off .
the calabrese : too damn spicy and hot .
you using ghost peppers on the pie ?
the caprese salad here is the bomb .
specialty is gourmet wood oven pizzas and massive salads .
he did comp the appetizer and our drinks .
the bread was also very tasty !
so the pricing is not exactly cheap .
we start eating and soon after the beverages arrive .
server did apologize again and blamed the bar .
unfortunately this was not up to par .
entrees made up for the poor appetizer .
had no issues with the allergies there .
my wife enjoyed them though .
not sure what that was all about ?
wife loved her margarita .
so that is important to note .
our server apologized and blamed it on the kitchen .
not the typical brink oven taste we expected .
the beer was cold .
sadly the kitchen and the food failed to deliver .
the entire experience was not that memorable .
"food , service and atmosphere are that good ."
have never had mediocre or bad service .
they also have great oysters .
always order half a dozen as an appetizer .
the steaks are the winner here .
we deserve a cloth .
my advice : get a shawerma plate .
really never had a bad meal here .
it always hits the spot .
been eating here for years .
the entrees were delivered with perfect timing .
really no complaints on the carnitas .
was no room for desert .
has great action at the bar .
servers are polite and attentive .
essentially it was <UNK> .
the macbook has been working like new .
they will give you an honest quote at best .
you well feel at home at miko ' s .
the rice is real winner here .
it ' s an art that they take serious .
did i mention draft beers too ?
the menu consist of burgers .
you can order them as single or double patties .
they even have a turkey burger on the menu .
"personally , this is what downtown needed ."
"good people , and good food ."
we thought the barkeep was joking .
he made some great suggestions for alternative drinks .
he ' s a great asset to this restaurant .
the restaurant was 00 % filled .
the cost was $ 00 .
my wife though it had a chipotle flavor .
the short rib entree was decent .
the meat was a bit dry and over cooked .
"i have tasted better , for far less money ."
the colorado rack of lamb was good .
"the asparagus was as expected , tasted good ."
the wine list was almost impossible to read .
it ' s not a quality look at all .
we ordered the ice cream as a desert .
the raw shell fish platter was superb .
the wine list confusing .
"solid pizza , we enjoyed it ."
keep up the good work <UNK> and family .
our server was a pretty girl imported from ireland .
not sure whats happening at rã ­ rã ¡ ?
the 0 small slices are not enough .
granted it ' s only a few dollars .
but it feels like they are <UNK> you .
quick review : heaping proportions of bland food .
service is hit and miss .
not sure what the hype is about this place ?
"honestly , it ' s bland and forgettable ."
too many good places near by .
mixed thoughts but it certainly showed some promise .
did n't look enticing at first .
"not the healthiest choice , but a delicious choice ."
the lady thought it had too much mayo .
or long enough for that second visit .
it took about 00 minutes max .
cracks sounded like tall <UNK> falling in the forest .
the adjustment was quick and proper .
i am able to refer this location with confidence .
i asked to be sat away from that noise .
not the best first impression .
the man ' s bathroom was quite the site .
she ' s tiny and i was impressed .
the chicken was overcooked and dry .
the bacon was hard as a rock .
saves them and anyone on a fixed income money .
first impression is ` ` wow !
' ' they give massive sized proportions .
will order this again and i highly recommend it .
but overall skinnyfats is out to a great start .
not a good look for this nice neighborhood .
it ' s old and <UNK> .
i saw the ent and <UNK> .
i saw the <UNK> several times .
very professional on his part .
in depth review : great concept .
utah chains are solid .
"it was quick , professional and the right price ."
paid the 0.00 thanks to yelp .
the room was good overall .
"haha , that should totally be a yelp badge ."
this place simply did a great job !
thank god the first tin was free .
definitely the made the night a whole lot better .
atmosphere : <UNK> decorated .
this is my hotel of choice on the strip .
your at the excalibur .
i would n't even really gamble there .
a lot of the dealers do n't speak english .
here for grand opening .
only two bartenders working .
$ 0 beers are great .
00 minutes to get a beer & still waiting .
the free food is pretty good .
"excellent food , great staff , cool atmosphere ."
our server was named melissa and she was great .
bone-in ribeye with smoked blue cheese was amazing .
if you value your time do likewise .
"get with the program , guys ."
that experience alone is worth staying here .
wander around in a <UNK> .
this is vintage <UNK> las vegas .
this place has a bomb turkey sandwich .
i would n't recommend the philly cheesesteak .
there is no other way to describe ka .
the food is pretty good as are the drinks .
i went to town on 0lbs of crab legs .
the ribs and the shrimp went well together .
the flapjacks have <UNK> pieces of mango in them .
"inexpensive by any standards , especially vegas ."
the buffet was a good choice .
very family friendly great waitress .
had the pork burrito with smothered cheese .
the world is as it should be .
"although furnishings showed wear , cleaner than i expected ."
"other than that , was very good ."
good value for price .
i drove by yesterday to get a sneak peak .
the new range looks amazing .
the food is decent but the bar service sucks .
it ' s that simple .
the counter folks were clueless .
save the burritos for those that deserve it .
nothing but the best wishes for this amazing restaurant .
0 - really interesting menu .
this is a gourmet interpretation of barbecue .
"there are some cool salads , apps ."
"also , their spice levels can be inconsistent ."
i have truly experienced a minor miracle .
anyway - it is great .
decades of fear have been <UNK> instead of <UNK> .
and me spitting for a while .
it ' s a $ 00 meal - family-owned .
they are great with locals and remembering names .
"they combine old favorites , they create new <UNK> ."
barbecue spots must be jealous .
let ' s be honest here .
"all in all , you ca n't beat yonaka ."
note to management : please raise prices .
00 hour opening is great .
only one star deduction for one reason .
service can be a bit spotty here .
they need to get the staffing right .
service and layout can be <UNK> .
drinks - only trust draft and bottle beer .
food - always excellent .
the moment of impact was excruciating .
' ' some restaurants deserve a second chance .
some <UNK> will help you .
salt made it slightly better .
huge alley with a ton of lanes .
$ 0 dollar bowling at certain hours .
even at peak hours the price is decent .
the environment is great .
the rolls are very good quality .
this place is great !
my girlfriend had the chicken pesto sandwich .
the orders took over an hour to serve .
the walls in the room were dirty .
the remote for the tv was missing .
"downtown location great stuff , will definitely go again ."
the bar is awesome .
always a good time here .
fresh fresh fresh clean sushi .
good for one two or friends .
. but just eat the seafood .
. weak for bread .
some <UNK> mexican american fusion .
just a try it once kind of place .
always cooked to perfection and seasoned just so .
people = service = profit !
its like your hometown bar away from your hometown !
low pretense chicken soul food joint .

circus circus is better .
i wrote a separate review for that .
i missed dinner reservations as a result .
i arrived and he quickly cleaned my vents .
"excellent food , reasonable prices and extremely good service ."
the service is very good .
the food was delicious and tasted real fresh .
"the salad bar , in my opinion was unacceptable ."
soon after that the meats started to come .
service was a bit on the low side .
sides & deserts were equally good .
another very solid michael mina restaurant .
finally there is good sushi in vegas .
same menu as nobu everywhere else .
"bellagio is a great casino resort , from <UNK> ."
sit as close to the front as possible .
the michelin star is well deserved .
try it if u do n't believe me .
and the room rates are cheap .
much improved from 0 years ago .
i do n't say that lightly .
and that should be all you need to know .
you can thank me later .
this is tough to find in vegas .
of course it ' s not just the room .
bigger is not better here .
this is las vegas .
"the vibe is sophisticated luxury , las vegas style ."
"so yes , you should dress accordingly ."
the only downside is that the service here blows .
you guy are fast food ?
probably the best <UNK> course phoenix has .
booked a ride using their web site .
received an e-mail confirmation .
here ' s the e-mail their system sent .
probably just some <UNK> with no db connector .
please do not reply .
this is a family business and is run well .
<UNK> this review as it got deleted .
get everything in writing and record all conversations .
it ' s an inexpensive place to live .
"yogurt is good , service is good ."
they had a total of three .
all the other toppings were candy .
"just mango , pineapple , and blackberries ."
the repair was done in less than 00 .
the line can get very long on nice days .
food was n't that great either for the price .
well organized flag football league .
i dunno what all the great reviews are for .
just a gun store for tourists to me .
i did not buy my gun here .
every lock is working perfectly !
and i come back for the potatoes alone .
the service is outstanding .
melissa needs to go to to six flags though .
"service was good , and prices were reasonable ."
a solid turkish place .
$ 0-0 bucks for a beer ?
a nice addition to the <UNK> grocery world .
this is solid korean cuisine .
both were quite tasty .
looking for korean food in madison ?
"tacos , sopes , burritos , dinner plates ."
it ' s crowded and noisy for a reason .
unassuming and authentic italian .
you could get lost in this place .
people get fussy about mexican restaurants .
is it authentic - lrb - which region ?
are they from socal or texas ?
then there are places that seem more real .
- rrb - are a win .
<UNK> unit had the chicken mole enchiladas .
"i had the yucatan classic , cochinita pibil ."
nicely presented and flavorful .
<UNK> makes the grade .
their hummus and <UNK> sauce is great .
i settled on a big o ale .
his excellent review pretty much sums up the details .
it could easy feed two for lunch .
"good stuff , check it out ."
every neighborhood should have a place like this .
a great addition to west side food shopping .
. italy is mediterranean but .
i can see why <UNK> like bunky ' s .
looking for inexpensive pie with salad from a bag ?
looking for great pizza ?
the other dishes may be worthwhile .
a perfect lunch on a cold day .
others have mentioned the decor .
the <UNK> unit will love it .
out of this world .
this is an old school italian american restaurant .
the s . u . had the veal parmigiana .
she thought the veal was a bit dry .
that ' s four stars right there .
"this is the pub , done right ."
got ta agree with the praise for los <UNK> .
all freshly made that should be freshly made .
this is foodie territory .
"decent , <UNK> wine list ."
do you have any local beers ?
both came with fried potatoes and sauerkraut .
the crust was a bit thin for my tastes .
the right level of <UNK> .
"as advertised , we walked into a mexican <UNK> ."
we were the only obviously <UNK> in the place .
"yes , i will be happy ."
a new place on the east side .
the bun with grilled pork missed the mark .
0 dinners and 0 lunches in house .
they were all excellent .
next time i ' ll survey a wider selection .
"the decor is open , no kitsch ."
not much to add .
an older established italian restaurant on the <UNK> .
the fresh white anchovy pizza was exceptional .
. 0 ... this place will work .
the <UNK> flat bread was excellent .
the other dishes were missing something .
so i say this .
"low key , creative , <UNK> food ."
"conversation slowed , <UNK> were said , happiness ensued ."
"laid back , confident and creative ."
is it like mexican ?
<UNK> just raised the bar in madison .
"wow , wow , wow !"
a malbec with the lamb would have been <UNK> .
so ... wine and beer is now available .
i walk out for less than $ 00 .
the egg rolls were excellent .
"lots of meat , not much filler ."
not pho lack of trying .
time for an update .
i ' ve warmed to this place .
i fully understand that individual pour-over takes time .
i actually kind of enjoy it sometimes .
joe ' s bbq is awesome !
not worth a single star .
very poorly managed establishment .
stay away from this place .
this is the worst managed place i have visit .
we should have gone to 0 guys .
what happen to the service ?
best bbq in arizona .
not worth even a single star .
this is a must dine experience while in scottsdale .
my daughter found the mahi mahi tacos fantastic .
"papaya salad ok , nice heat ."
it ' s just not very good .
the valets were great dealing with my big truck .
had trash and sticky stuff all over .
the food was actually pretty good .
attitude from the start .
at least the wings were good .
thanks again for an unforgettable evening .
what a wonderful facility clark county has developed .
so no internet during my stay .
my favorite buffet in vegas .
"friday morning , no line ."
these guys are great .
to be fair the drink was flawless .
"i mean this was a perfect , perfect manhattan ."
so good i ordered two .
i think at about covers it .
you have seen better days .
what a delightful property .
the room was spacious and the living area comfortable .

bar service sitting at the bar is very slow .
got some hotdogs they were excellent .
", service is excellent and the menu is elegant ."
good job dc keep it rockin !
food st ok but expensive for what it is .

great addition to the bar staff .
i wont drop another dime there .

"<UNK> was undercooked and tough , again little flavor ."
"food is bonanza grade , at <UNK> prices ."
very good prices and excellent food .
"wine selections vastly improved , very good pours ."
owner is great really does care about the customer .
"excellent food , service and location ."
ca n't wait for locations in so cal .
"they include , salmon , oysters and more ."
take this from an indian who was starving .
"ok , the only silver lining was their samosa ."
ok 00 bucks for 0 samosas .
best dumplings i have eaten .
next thing i know .
flannel from another world .
but not your average 0 pack .
this shit does not wedge you ever .
"again , more shots fired ."
"hell , even i knew it ."
"folds , packs and bags in less than seconds ."
the only real <UNK> is what sides to get .
did i mention ` ` old school ' ' ?
the lamb is excellent as well .
misc : reservations are always helpful but not necessary .
the <UNK> and kimchi <UNK> were awesome as well .
in addition to <UNK> it was $ 00 .
"nice , friendly , and fun to talk with ."
now for my 0 big gripes about the place .
"first , the worst margaritas in vegas ."
"ah , the cornish pasty ."
this place is great .
i washed it down with a martini .

golf review at : http://url
tacos are cheap and beer is decently priced .
the braised beef was bomb !
most of the items we tried was good .
now my wife ca n't get to work .
if you need chevrolet service go to another dealer .
<UNK> with is an exceptional law firm .
best americano and this is coming from <UNK> .
i come to wynn 0-0 times a year .
imagine a 00 min roller coaster ride ... .
but 000 % better .
awesome - nuff said .
"overall , an unbelievable experience ."
"anyhow , still highly recommended ."
<UNK> have nascar tracks .
mine is hash house a go go .

great service and value !
no amenities of any kind .
"food was ok , i had loss n bagel ."
averaged $ 00 a head .
"worst service ever , really unbelievable ."
room was large and cheap .
park your own car in easy walking distance .
i ' m not joking .
"after dining here , screw the buffets !"
what really did me in was the seafood risotto .
here you have to be classy folks .
cheers for ` ` orange team ' ' .
"the food is excellent , especially the cornish pasties ."
this is a great small business .
sean and his staff know their shit .
i will call him for work in the future .
nice place with good food .
barely would of qualified as medium .
"good food , not just good vegan food ."
"the inside is eclectic , not corporate ."
i mean take notice and say wow .
every piece of was dressed properly .
and then everything was good .
"lighting up high , and not to much ."
wifi did not work .
i have had a better meal at red lobster .
very limited tap beer selection .
nothing special on the wine list .
"really , just super hard to beat this place ."
they are good places to eat .
plenty of good vegetarian options also .
"overall , i have to stick with four stars ."
seriously good breakfast and desert items with ok coffee .
very handy west side location other than that .
"great pho , and other dishes ."
other guests at nearby tables had similar experience .
school days at lunch time can get hairy .
and then there ' s the beer .
that ends up being half the fun .
"simply put , the ambiance is bright and inviting ."
we like the exposed brick look outside .
went safe on the menu with the pepper steak .
where to start with the rio hotel & casino .
also included in the resort fee was internet service .
"the entrees were somewhat disappointing , just average ."
but the salsa and guacamole were above average .
very tasty for a local area pizza place .
"nicely remodeled , especially with the rooms ."
the ride in all four elevators was quite bumpy .
"at 0am , they started up the power tools ."
mark and rick are great !
they just got done with their kitchen remodel .
food is really expensive .
- gambling tables available .
i called again and had them replaced .
the food was great but one thing stood out .
these people are a $ $ holes !
just another average buffet place .
the chef behind the omelet station was on point .
this place was really packed .
the name speaks for itself .
friendly staff that provide excellent service .
ca n't complain about my recent visit .
i hope the mgm buffet management acknowledge his work .
the staff are real cool here .
well done <UNK> and jason .
seven day stay between christmas and new year .
birds in the atrium while food was being served .
how do they get away with this .
"hey hilton , are you listening to this ?"
i might very well need a new battery .
the king cut prime rib is amazing .
"the sides are good , too ."
this is not a place for the birds .
but today broke that impression .
the only available beverages were water and iced tea .
"even after obtaining our sandwiches , nothing tasted fresh ."
better to walk across the parking lot to chipotle .
you cant use other mcdonalds receipt coupons here .
stop nickel and <UNK> everybody .
the place need a makeover .
"overall , the restaurant is ok in my opinion ."
more the buffet at luxor save your money .
the food was good but not outstanding .
this place is the worst restaurant in vegas .
"services , food , and dinning area are failed ."
we are going dim sum somewhere else nowadays .
0.0 stars is over rated for this store .
i was there for business lunch meeting .
the quality and quantity are great .
"great food , fun atmosphere , amazing staff ."
food : i have never had a bad meal .
yumm ! ! great movie place .
i will be back very soon .
"run , run far far away from this location ."
food is worth every penny .
it ' s fun and good food .
a small four slice pizza is around $ 00 .
i like it ... i will be back .
this place is pretty good .
the pork jerky was just as advertised ... jerky .
peanut sauce was standard .
the chocolate croissant was excellent .
big thumbs up on that .
bun was nicely done .
is it a top tier burger place ?
"legit ny style pizza joint , with great ingredients ."
you ca n't beat this .
chicken noodle soup : standard .
for a fusion place ... not bad .
"unacceptable , especially for dinner ."
very friendly staff and good food .
best breakfast in las vegas .
"after waiting 00 minutes , it came out lukewarm ."
"$ 00 later , we walked out very disappointed ."
this is the most unprofessional business in town .
"sorry , that ' s another league ."
i voiced my concerns and management offered free breakfasts .
buffets are still among the best on the strip .
i had the pho with brisket and flank .
best veggie egg rolls ! ! a must have .
i had the asian connection from the house favorites .
this is my second time here .
both times were great .
phil is a great bartender .
jen is awesome and so is <UNK> .
excellent food and service .
they need to get rid of the fluorescent lighting .
this place is awful .
the food was so bad .
mcdonald ' s has better food for you .
spend your money elsewhere .
ribs and chili are my favorite .
pricing isnt too bad either .
you like <UNK> beers ?
star is knocked off due to bad memories .
things went downhill from there .
entrees arrived at 0:00 with a slight problem .
' ' great beer and really good beer bread .
stupid lack of <UNK> !
we were escorted to a table on the patio .
"ok , it happens ."
ninety minutes for breakfast .
"tons of taco options , always fresh ."
night out with the wife ?
"amazing rolls , always fresh ."
can not go wrong .
but always a good pie and peroni on tap .
"nevertheless , it ' s worth the money ."
great service ; great steaks ; great martinis .
one of my top few locals steakhouses .
like the taj of targets .
highly recommend stopping by for a pint or three .
great place to meet people before a baseball game .
"besides that , not a whole lot to say ."
"cold beer , average wings / burgers ."
got a great cut from mark one morning .
old school barbershop feel in a convenient location .
only negative would be the fox news on tv .
but the world is n't a perfect place .
the food is top-notch bar fare .
western burger was also great .
that means nobody really comes and takes orders .
but beggars ca n't be <UNK> during flight delays .
"lots of tvs all over , which is cool ."
stop in and get a cold beer .
i get paying for the atmosphere is downtown summerlin .
but this felt a little outrageous .
the food is great .
really nice tapas platter and decent sandwiches .
but no brunch menu whatsoever .
does this need a review ?
domestic brews and sports on the tv .
totally recommend it for a low-key stop .
they did a great job .
i love the warranty these guys offer .
definitely the best in town .
"service was decent , but nothing spectacular ."
a truly excellent cup of coffee .
very good thai food .
came here at approximately 0pm for lunch .
i would recommend 0/0 .
pb banana pudding beer ... nuff said .
we ate here when visiting for the grand prix .
"result : best , most versatile haircut ever ."
that ' s pretty good odds for vegas .
this place is horrible .
wow stay away from the samsung area .
. no other help offered .
none of us liked any of the food there .
the collard greens are simple and elegant .
this meat also tends to fall off the bone .
- lsb - the primary downsides <UNK> around access .
"having said all that , <UNK> is relatively new ."
a simple miscommunication or oversight by the staff ?
everything here is kind of so-so .
"heck , nothing here has ever not disappointed me ."
and that ' s enough <UNK> for one review .
the value proposition is very simple .
better than your normal soft drink offerings .
- rrb - think of average pizza .
provides a quintessential local food item ?
place to take every first-time visitor to the city ?
lots of history and culture ?
but compared to a philly cheesesteak ?
a new orleans <UNK> ?
"choices are colorful , well-rounded , and fresh ."
call in the order and avoid the rush .
"sorry , peter ' s ."
this place just keeps getting worse .
it ' s a nice bar inside .
* the bar is well stocked .
"i tried two , and they were both delicious ."
simply put : the sushi here was not good .
but its seasonally rotating menu can be quite hit-or-miss .
other items were pretty good .
the lobster roll was bland .
opinion : nothing else was that good either .
the menu does look delicious with lots of options .
' ' this place is ok .
the <UNK> chicken and cumin lamb are especially good .
the worst part of a trip here is choosing .
another drawback might be the servers .
coffee : not hot enough .
same temperature as the coffee .
sausage : pretty terrible .
the show : technical difficulties .
right now it ' s just taking up space .
"not necessarily stellar or friendly , but fast ."
0 - rrb - the food is cheap .
0 - rrb - the experience is consistent .
but orient express certainly has its advantages .
"look , you get the idea ."
now onto the food .
spoiler alert : it was not .
the rice was a little undercooked .
apparently such alcohol <UNK> are a common occurrence .
nothing special here either .
the ambiance : it ' s often unnecessarily loud .
0 - rrb - the pulled pork .
"not bad , but nothing special ."
0 - rrb - the pulled chicken .
"also unremarkable , and a little bland ."
but perfectly serviceable with the addition of sauces .
0 - rrb - the nachos .
ingredients were haphazardly piled on and not well distributed .
0 - rrb - the ribs .
0 - rrb - the brisket .
the word ` ` grilled ' ' barely applied .
maybe the cart is better .
other people seem to like this place .
"the food is good , and excellently spiced ."
' ' you wo n't be disappointed .
what more could you want in a greasy spoon ?
it ' s just a fun place .
my salmon sandwich was so-so at best .
how did we learn how to make robots ?
there ' s no real specialties .
make everything on the menu exceptionally clear .
' ' or anything of the sort .
i guess they will hire anyone off the street .
maybe push it to an hour ?
the scallops were very well prepared .
not very tender or juicy .
that line was slower than death itself .
a very good place to go for thai food .
a unique community and a great coffee experience .
the best pizza in charlotte area .
the ingredients are always very fresh .
they have several kinds of pizza sauces as well .
wide variety of burger choices .
service was extremely slow .
service is a bit crap to be honest .
what more can you ask for ?
you ' ll get a better price that way .
no continental breakfast but i can manage .
i will be going back soon .
well worth the stop .
worth a try for a quick burger meal .
they would make a great after bar food .
i will be going back .
"wow , worst food at a sandwich place ."
avoid this location at all costs .
"wow , worst food at a sandwich place ."
avoid this location at all costs .
store is very clean and well organized .
can buy their hotdogs in the supermarket .
"open 00/0 , good <UNK> , tasty and inexpensive ."
they would not make the sandwich .
always order it cause it is good .
took my young son for a late lunch .
off to a good start .
the staff is professional and works well with children .
the gym has its act together .
food is average for the price .
been here a few times with friends .
i will be going back .
"i have four bikes , none expensive ."
frank is a great resource .
went in for food twice over the weekend .
the decor is dark with a little kitsch .
their check-in process needs major <UNK> evaluation .
things did n't add up .
top 0 sushi places i ' ve been to .
this is the best ayce sushi in vegas .

it can be tough to find though .
everything seems to have a southwest flare .
the short rib ' s are a must try .
the northern exposure and tempe turkey are excellent .
i recommend you try them .
oh a dozen bagels are half priced after 0pm .
they do a good job inside and out .
not sure you can review a library .

the yakisoba contained a perfect mix of ingredients .
wide variety of pinball machines and arcade games .
both adults and children were having a blast here .
"yep , this place has your standard breakfast fare ."
this place is pretty good for takeout .
maybe some vegetables would be in order here ?
this place is a madison standout in my mind .
the vegetarian options are especially tasty as well .
the fish fry is a good dish .
good soundtrack as well music at a reasonable volume .
serves food ' til 00 on weeknights .
not the fastest service but worth the wait .
i have been coming here for 00 + years .
asian boneless wings are great .
this place is uber swanky !
the views from the place are amazing .
the pool and the rooms are also top notch .

it ' s a guy thing .
"like the sofa , it came out perfect ."
thanks f & f !
"amazing find with great atmosphere , food and service ."
i went straight for the boiled crab legs .
i moved on to the chinese .
the sweetness offered a good balance .
it was excellent for ramen at a buffet .
easily the best buffet in vegas .
i left feeling more like it was a gimmick .
there were some good points .
"the pepperoni was nice , big and thick ."
the place is kind of cool .
wow what a great find in madison .
i stayed at the talking stick for four days .
"second , drinks were overpriced ."
but $ 0.00 for a beer is outrageous .
"scallops were very well cooked , and very flavorful ."
over all a nice place to go .
service : about average .
most disappoint museum experience ever .
serviceable as a general restraunt .
nothing has officially impressed me nor upset me there .
the food was served hot and fast .
all at a reasonable price .
"decent food , but nothing special ."
lots of different beers though .
was brown on outside but frozen on inside still .
you can tell its grilled on propane .
which got into the food .
again lazy way is cutting it any shapes .
i hope your restaurant the best .
will be back again .
some of the best pizza outside of nyc .
nice little place in a strip mall .
i tried the island banana and milk chocolate .
great food and a great atmosphere .
the filet was good .
"or , better yet , get some dessert ."
"yes , this does n't impact the overall experience ."
"like many of these hotels , valet is required ."
it was included with our reservation .
and this one does not disappoint .
we have gone a number of times .
this property fit the bill .
plus the price was right .
i was once again transferred .
it is in close proximity to the strip .
my wife saw it featured in sunset magazine .
the restaurant is small and will get busy early .
i do not think you will be disappointed .
the breadsticks are a must-try .
the <UNK> are awesome .
it is a nice stop in the bellagio .
"however , there are some issues that i have ."
i decided to try the southwest burger .
the chipotle mayo was a nice addition .
this does inevitably increase the total bill a bit .
there was sauce and ceramic all over the place .
"overall , it is a decent restaurant ."
the burgers are pretty good .
"in this case , it was good ."
what a nice little gem in the desert .
this was never the case .
mojo was a really good choice .
the service was exceptional .
the food was just as exceptional .
it is definitely worth trying .
an interesting concept that was well executed .
"from that perspective , this one did not disappoint ."
"most notably , everything was a little less spicy ."
"instead , they were pretty bland ."
the crowd is mixed and interesting .
"cheeseburger , grilled onions , chopped chilis , <UNK> ."
thank god grandma in-n-out looked favorably on arizona .
they seem to pretty much have everything under control .
and there will be a next trip .
it ' s a byob as well .
makino is an excellent value for a sushi buffet .
check in with yelp and get a free refreshment .
beer : selection was great .
check this place out .
"short wait times , friendly staff ."
the food probably came out 00 minutes after that .
this is somewhere to avoid .
avoid this location if you have other options .
"airport looked clean and nice , and free wifi ."
anywhere that has free wifi is cool with me .
"eric b bad service , bad food ."
was in town visiting and needed a quick cut .
besides the bartender i barley saw another server .
they should let people know before they pay .
i would expect more from a greek owned place .
with you of the lake is nice also .
probably a good place to watch a game .
overall i suggest going there other than <UNK> buffet .
great place to eat .
get a couple of different fries and share them .
staff is well trained in service .
better ran than the one in gvr .
make him the manager of the gvr store .
went in tonight at 0: 00 pm .
very very bad first experience .
ordered an appetizer and a pizza .
way over priced drinks with no refills .
this time was remarkably better .
server <UNK> really knocked it out .
it ' s a great place .
must try is the surf and turf sushi .
my personal favorite is the gumbo .
great specials when you want to be price conscience .
i have stayed there over 000 nights on business .
for a anniversary stay get a flat suite .
the place is ran by idiots .
complete waste of time to got there today .
recommended for las vegas and henderson .
you owe me some bacon that i paid for .
thank god for <UNK> and yelp to vent .
do n't know what everyone else is talking about .
used this service three times now .
leaving this month to poor service .
recommended for students and <UNK> .
"gentlemen , start you engines ."
"yes , read it and weep !"
asked for the next bigger .
"ordered the hat directly from <UNK> , no issues ."
"strike 0 , you ' re out ."
rivals a pizza you would get in new york .
this is a place for couples and friends .
the portions are very good size .
food comes out cold and / or way late .
the staff seems disjointed and poorly managed .
this place has a really solid happy hour too .
the place looked nice and the staff was friendly .
hardly any sausage flavor .
hash browns were under cooked .
a little pricy but the gyros are good .
go to taco bell across the street .
half the price for the same diarrhea .
with the sauces that accompanied it .
great tacos and tortas .
i was recommended to dodge electric by my sister .
glad to have a place like this in tempe .
service department is a joke .
that ' s the biz .
overall it was a good experience .
this is a sports bar & grill .
i ' ll explain what i mean by best .
really nice ambiance and service .
very nice and elegant .
this is a definite winner .
what <UNK> here ? ? ? <UNK> .
was this a bad thing ?
planet hollywood ' s food selection is fucking terrible !
for $ 0 you can get an awesome sandwich .
the food is simple but fucking amazing .
this spot is literally a diamond in the rough .
all i have to say is oh <UNK> got .
the sweetness <UNK> the freshness of the prawn .
i was unable to apply the coupon .
month later i get a bill from them .
long wait time looked like they over booked .
just an average burger and so-so shake .
just had a great lunch here .
that would have pushed this place to 0 stars .
the website states that they are open .
this was on diners drive ins and dives .
i had the pork burrito that guy had .
the temperature of it was slightly warm at best .
the service was very good .
overall the food was very good .
everything at <UNK> is good .
this place is a joke .
this is a great local find .
"horrible , horrible wait times ."
there are about 00-00 stacked up in line .
will never rent here ever again .
stopped in for lunch last week .
i cant recommend it enough .
stores within the casino are very expensive .
well worth the trip 0/ 0/ 00 update .
wifi was intermittent at best .
buffet was so surprisingly bad it was laughable .
lasagna was cafeteria grade ... 0 .
spent a lot of time guessing what direction .
gaming area is small and unappealing .
"long walk to the valet , bad design 0 ."
"great pool , location , restaurant ."
"room was very nice , staff is courteous ."
the atmosphere is like a high school cafeteria .
the steak was amazing .
fair price and excellent service .
the food is great .
the overall experience here was unsatisfactory .
i ' ll remove the appetizers from your bill .
this is when things got really out of control .
very dirty seriously needs updated .

just as they should be .
best american style chinese food in madison .
"love the rice , ribs and egg rolls ."
pricing is comparable for the quality of the food .
great south american food .
fixed my bike for free to adjust my tires .
meatball sub was amazing .
the gambling tables were overcrowded with <UNK> .
it is pretty cheap so that is a positive .
"awesome , best <UNK> in town ."
"great service , great coffee ."
very nice park with paved and <UNK> trails .
hard to believe las vegas has wetlands .
my 0 and 0 year old enjoyed it .
good place for breakfast or lunch .
they serve beer as well .
lots of open space and green grass .
one of the better buffets in vegas .
price is very good .
sign up for there rewards card and save money .
wait staff was attentive .
chocolate <UNK> dessert was ok .
coffee was very good .
wife had the same issue .
had a porter house steak that was pretty tough .
strange out of the way bbq joint .
"large portions , good bbq and sides ."
outdoor pick nick tables available but most carryout .
"place was full of mexicans , another good sign ."
nice mexican draft beer selection .
services was very good .
"fish <UNK> fried , not much flavor ."
"<UNK> flavor , slimy feel ."
this was a bad idea .
this place was hella hood .
this place is pretty tight .
my only real complaint is the sports book .
the pool here is money .
worst wendy ' s i have ever had .
this place is the best .
"at least compared to the rio , and ceasars ."
really love the place .
this place has the best italian hoagie ever .
the bun was exceptional .
"well , that ' s true ."
the fries are fine .
steak in vegas is just ridiculous now .
that ' s pretty damn reasonable .
i got mine medium-rare and asked for medium char .
' ' do n't get charred .
"thick , good asparagus were used for the side ."
the sides are nothing home to write about .
do n't get <UNK> by the lobster mashed potatoes .
the other sides are fine .
"rich and vibrant , solid fruit and nice acidity ."
delmonico ' s continues that tradition .
the service is excellent .
the riesling was recommended by the asst . sommelier .
the waiter initially recommended an australian white blend .
because everything went right .
i am once again a fan of emeril .
i can not disagree .
thats why i gave them a 0 star rating .
i may be canceling my membership .
kudos to management and the staff .
hope it continues to stay clean and fresh .
the <UNK> is not great .
looks poor in some areas .
install was fairly easy .
easily the worst paradise bakery in the west valley .
the service is atrocious .
follow your instincts always .
but i did n't and thats my own fault .
really ! ? ! that adjusting them ?
theres nothing else i can do .
follow your gut instincts .
another argument starts until security shows up .
it was a very deep pink in the center .
every item that i tried was amazing .
closest i get to ny take out .
"the food , quite inexpensive , is very good ."
excellent food and service .
a very classy scottsdale restaurant .
all these five star reviews are right .
this gelato is as good as any in italy .
this place was very good .
"great food , excellent wines and appetizers , too ."
prices are very good .
the food here is fantastic .
"everything works flawlessly , too ."
as good as any italian restaurant anywhere .
this place is always good and always consistent .
food was not in kfc standards .
ended up ordering more food elsewhere .
lady in drive thru unpleasant .
will not eat here ever again .
<UNK> sarah who <UNK> the restaurants .
hopefully it gets back to the corporate office .
i see why this place is a joke !
i agree with the other review .
good ratio of rice and fresh ingredients .
<UNK> n't to learn about firearms and proper use ?
"awesome atmosphere , good tacos , and great beer ."
got way too crowded in mins .
one of the best promoters in vegas .
looks like it is permanent .
the bread is awesome .
inside is very clean and the atmosphere is casual .
in terms of the salsa .
<UNK> between the two was surprisingly grand .
what more can i ask for ?
you can taste the high quality of their meat .
nice fillets and lightly breaded it was very good .
great place for a first date !
"i must tell you , the food is fantastic ."
the staff is also very friendly and professional .
the restaurant itself is kept clean and sanitary .
food was very good great size steak !
breakfast food was average .
eggs were overcooked and not enough hollandaise .
i tried the corn beef hash .
"not bad , not great ."
00min to get drinks and 00min for food .
you can do better than this .
as hotels go this one is fine .
the rooms are comfortable and the amenities are decent .
but the real draw has been the staff .
always friendly and helpful .
the crispy duck bao is .
. without much character .
the pork belly bao is very fatty .
nothing special in the <UNK> .
spend your money elsewhere .
"clearly , the best indian food in las vegas ."
<UNK> 0 stars but beware of future decline .
<UNK> about sums it up .
the ambiance of this place is second to none .
this is a cafeteria .
the staff spoke good english and was great .
this place is something else .
i love the roast turkey ranch and bacon wrap .
dee ' s doughnuts are more better imo .
it was nicely clean and well maintained .
"the beef tasted very old , stale and hard ."
"another day , another family chinese dinner ."
good but nothing noteworthy .
"the hong <UNK> noodles were great , though ."
the aesthetics of the cafe were pretty well done .
it felt ` ` premium .
i thought the price did n't justify the food .
this beat the lunch selections ten times over .
"they were both good , nothing extraordinary ."
perhaps his shift is not the busiest .
i ' ve eaten here a few times before .
it ' s a mcdonald ' s .
"yes , we eat that much rice ."
i would eat at this place again .
the food typically came out hot and fresh .
i ' m going to miss this place .
my review on that place coming soon .
this place definitely delivers that much .
"for $ 0.00 , the food is pretty good ."
they have a pretty good assortment of food choices .
none of that do n't - care attitude .
"if you need to , you can wait inside ."
the car wash itself is great .
i drove in for a car wash at alamo .
i answered every question and the claim went through .
"now , my insurance premium will probably go up ."
i ' d come back in the future .
i walked in and was greeted by friendly waitresses .
i could n't stop myself from digging right in .
the noodles were good as well .
the red sauce was also good .
i would have only saved 00 cents .
this place is a typical popeyes .
it took them about 00 minutes to arrive .
the chicken fried steak was good .
not bad for an eat-in meal and another to-go .
the prices are also similar .
i ordered a carne asada burrito .
the burrito itself was just as big .
i ' m a red sauce guy .
i ' m a fan .
i was greeted and served by this friendly guy .
this is where the problems started .
' ' what total bs .
"shady business practice , i tell you ."
i came to this place after having yogurt .
there was quite sizable line .
"the fries themselves are good , but nothing special ."
"overall , a good place to catch a snack ."
food and service is excellent ! ! ! robert <UNK>
has the management looked at the clientele recently ?
so much for ` ` reservations ' ' .
entrees often come out near room temperature .
spotty service with long waits for refills .
"sides were great , main course was great ."
"man , this place is good ."
you will not be disappointed .
went here with my family for dinner .
have to say it was great .
"fresh oysters , shrimp , crab & lobster ."
cooked to a perfect medium rare .
peppercorn sauce on the side was excellent .
you will not be disappointed .
for the main we had medium rare mesa burger .
it probably deserves 0â 0/0 stars .
there are a couple of negative points .
the lighting is very low .
all in all this place is pretty good .
anyway ... this is a zoo .
little birds in <UNK> .
<UNK> and proper indeed .
these guys show respect !
"i got to say , they work hard ."
the food is thoughtful and creative .
overall not a good experience on any front .
the food is overpriced .
the quality of the food is not adequate .
the toast was over toasted and burnt .
there are much better choices in the area .
pro ' s : large rooms .
i have stayed here once before .
that ' s really not accurate .
strong smoke smell like most casinos .
the towel rack is barely hanging on the wall .
not very many channels on the tv .
strong smoke smell like most casinos .
the towel rack is barely hanging on the wall .
the performance the cast puts on is top notch .
"the music is great , as is the story ."
one of the better concessions and clean movie theaters .
its kept clean and the staff always greats yo .
very friendly and very keen to a customers needs .
"the reason being , the owners are different ."
. evening crew is better than the morning crew .
"the guys here are careful , knowledgable and fast ."
. really good pizza and friendly staff .
the owner wrote me a message about my review .
. great food but music can get loud .
the jacket is in moderate condition .
finally gave up and kept walking .
need to have a start ground for our youth .
its definitely not cafe rio
the meal was also very good .
love the fresh green sauce as well .
we love this place and will keep coming back .
what an incredible dining experience .
i ordered the chicago dog .
i do my best to put it back together .
my wife ordered the sliders .
they were noticeable dry .
the chicken had no moisture or flavor .
i ordered the combination pho .
but <UNK> kitchen ' s pho was still excellent .
at $ 0 these are an absolute steal .
now i like my italian beef very wet .
i must say that it was very good .
"the meat was excellent , as was the bun ."
the au jus was fantastic as well .
and they dipped it perfectly .
i get mine with both hot and sweet peppers .
the giardiniera lacked something .
slicing it up smaller helps when eating the sandwich .
the only other issue i had was the price .
now to the pulled pork .
my favorite combo : 0 .
"huge oyster selection , great food ."
really good wings at this place .
the fried pickles were great too .
the staff gets 0 stars .
the steak was n't the greatest .
: - lrb - the steak was pretty tough .
the lobster tail was a little over cooked .
that was one tasty burger .
great ambiance for dinner .
"so , why not 0 star ?"
i wanted to like this place .
- rrb - ... crystal did a great job .
"overall , the food had been good here ."
food is good ; service needs to improve .
"plus , communication is sometimes difficult ."
will give it another shot .
hope it is better .
it ' s about teaching kung fu .
"authentic people , unpretentious and genuine and accessible ."
truly a hidden jewel in las vegas .
check it out and see for yourself .
honest as a mechanic can be .
"does good work , and always goes beyond expectations ."
pricing is always fair and work is guaranteed .
you wo n't regret going to this guy .
very delicious good food !
some of the best mole in town .
why is this place still open ?
"staff are unfriendly at best , and rude generally ."
it ' s a dive .
"though , nice layout and seating despite being small ."
it ' s under new management and owners .
needs work on system for taking orders .
not the worst park as it is <UNK> .
even the coffee is good .
it comes down to the service .
went to check it out .
no staff to be found .
good food and service .
new bird owners - stay away !
"but , lines generally move fairly well ."
the is consistently good and so is the coffee .
just a great little find .
what happens in vegas stays on yelp .
"by the way , two words : animal style !"
very much worth it .
awesome awesome donuts all around !
i rate this location 0nd to the bottom .
tempe was the worse of the embassy .
rooms small and no elevators .
i do not recommend this or tempe location .
other 0 embassy ' s in phoenix is better .
this place is a must try .
give them a try and come hungry .
overall an excellent experience .
it is a keeper !
typically the drive thru is backed up .
of course nan ' s is in this category .
salad was crisp service was excellent beer was cold .
hush puppies were great excellent herb garlic butter .
really nice for the price i recommend .
great cheese steaks also nuff said !
"to rip me off , that ' s why ."
the atmosphere is underrated .
this is an important detail after being stuffed .
"our appetizer , the hamachi , was decent ."
the drinks : expensive but tasty .
great spot for quality sandwiches .
"excellent service , friendly staff and quality sandwiches ."
i ' ll be back .
get your act together cafe rio .
so i need to update my previous review .
this location has gotten a lot better .
well here ' s my take .
no none of us got any action that night .
"everything , in fact , is very reasonably priced ."
please stop by and check it out .
0nd time here and still loving the place .
but it beats the <UNK> the last time .
the atmosphere is great for singles or parties .
can you say vegas withdrawals ?
"if you are a player , forget this place ."
they nickel and dime you to death .
"so , i <UNK> it out ."
"please , do n't stay here ."
do yourself a favor and avoid these <UNK> .
and a <UNK> feeling by our table of four .
the mocha was good and food was decent .
the best place for pizza and wings .
great service as well .
but the steak and chicken is great .
then followed by the food .
stop over on willy street and look no further .
they have great breakfast lunch and dinner options .
and finally the coffee and atmosphere .
wow is all i can say .
i frequent this establishment quite often .
first night we went into moon at the palms .
"again , no hassle ."
they are pretty limited .
i ' m not complaining .
i would highly recommend them to anyone .
email and phone ready for all questions .
i ordered the south mountain burrito .
not the case here .
you got ta come here .
the place is always clean and tidy .
what a great restaurant experience .
sangria and <UNK> to wash everything down .
the smoked foie gras terrine was spectacular !
* - rrb - cab ride from their hotel .
would gladly return there in a heartbeat .
service here is very very slow .
rob is as legit as they come .
"great attention to detail , quality , and professionalism ."
wo n't use anyone else .
the manager asked what happened to the case .
go to a real verizon store .
glad this place closed !
worst experience i have ever had in my life .
rick was accommodating to our schedule and needs .
. i have been using them for many years .
. i ordered the seafood <UNK> .
and then there ' s the desert .
the shitake mushrooms were very dry this time .
and it was out of this world .
mix is my favorite spot in vegas .
mix lounge is a great place to hangout .
and the waitresses are more attentive than other places .
the sausage links / patties were disgusting as well .
the service was pretty good however .
i had my best college football experience here .
just the same as the hob in your city .
the food is what you expect .
"very corporate , very precisely portioned ."
now i think i ' ve lost that privilege .
but who ' s sleeping ?
the dealers and the bosses are friendly .
this was not the case in the past .
want a table upstairs on the terrace ?
did i have a lobster tail with it ?
mandalay place is a solid mall too .
"lengua , carnitas , and chorizo tacos were great ."
the owners are friendly and humble and great cooks .
it was fantastic and tender beyond belief .
do yourself a huge favor and stop in .
0x0 animal style protein style hold the mustard .
"after two visits , i have my order down ."
"milkshake is good , but not great ."
got a corporate rate .
"all in all , great value for the buck ."
nice shops and restaurants .
"for the price , the food was unreal ."
great date or group spot for dinner .
everyone agreed ... best stop on the trip .
this restaurant is likely my favorite anywhere .
sushi is high quality .
must try surf and turf roll .
miso glazed chilean sea bass out of this world .
noodle and rice dishes are great .
not a bad selection to be had .
have nothing bad to say .
one of my favorite mexican food restaurants around .
awesome atmosphere and great music playing .
this place is suck !
these guys wo n't last long .
tried again ; no answer .
had the kobe burger .
tables are tiered off on levels .
<UNK> & <UNK> to drai ' s .
i would check it out if you have n't .
very good show with a very unique stage .
is it the best in town ?
a big area with many <UNK> that feels private .
this dish was excellent .
suggest going and checking this place out .
the rooms are hugh at this all suite hotel .
hopefully now it will survive casino <UNK> .
the service at mon ami is incredibly great .
"great food , great service , great price ."
what more could you ask for ?
"oh yeah that ' s right , the setting ."
what more could you ask for ?
great quality food at an amazing price .
great value in my opinion .
have a temporary license issued by the mvd .
this place is a gem .
i ca n't speak towards the cocktails .
this may be my first negative review .
"fries were excellent - on point , really ."
the food was top notch .
the carne asada <UNK> exploded with flavor .
- rrb - what ' s next ?
the short ribs are seasoned to perfection .
"great facility , everything is state of the art ."
"lastly , no woods ."
unbelievable value for lunch .
fresh ingredients and genuine japanese chefs !
i like this place because the ingredients are different .
great job mr . keller .
we are frequent dinners .
the worst was named correctly ' the mistake ' .
false prices on website .
at least corp . made an effort .
"great staff , quick service and a clean facility ."
finally a place worth while near buckeye !
- lrb - only cleaner - rrb - .
"ok , not great ."
"wait staff is friendly , music is awesome ."
feels more commercial and less caring now .
"good , best around anyway ."
real reasonable prices and the staff is great .
not like a hooters .
want to start it off on the wrong foot ?
this place is just a notch below that .
beer selection is lacking and food was n't appetizing .
service was top notch and the atmosphere was excellent .
food was outstanding and service was great .
a little ghetto fab of a mall .
food was pretty average and coffee was as well .
for the price it is not with it .
what a great place .
walked in and a very home-style feel to it .
"wow , great place ."
"electronics section , garden stuff and garden furniture ."
"awesome experience , nice people ."
low price and high quality work .
leaves the work area cleaner than the owner .
matt goes above and beyond in cleaning dryer vents .
there ' s nothing like it .
please do n't order the beef tongue .
it smells like rancid meat .
one front bumper and one for the running boards .
"solid work , very friendly and meticulous ."
probably 0.0 out of 0 .
did n't feel like getting back into a rental .
now with <UNK> wheel swirls on the hood .
"btw , car 0 also came back dusty ."
another item of concern is the shakes .
the food server was very good and extremely professional .
the atmosphere was very good as well .
"alas , apparently this practice no longer exists ."
must be because of the alcohol .
definitely recommend their beer if your in the area .
ribs are excellent as is the chicken picatta !
great peppery taste though !
breakfast is their best offering here .
"come on , potatoes are n't that much ."
and you ca n't always say that .
- lrb - this is where the fun begins .
start to dig in and every thing was cold !
"sausage , ham , bacon all cold ."
"how could this be bad , right ?"
i asked my wife how her food was .
instinct says drop by orleans while in vegas .
seafood mix chowder - very unique and tasty mix .
the pace can be a little bit faster .
not exactly cheap and not expensive per se .
i ordered a chow fun .
service : friendly staff .
they seem to know half the customers walking in .
environment : this <UNK> is empty .
pretty pricey for what it is .
service : great server and friendly staff overall .
environment : this building is very grand .
i would suggest chicken thigh meat .
hummus - smooth texture .
not much service necessary at a place like this .
"small portion , but very well executed ."
sauce is light yet savory .
large pieces of shitake .
this is a 0 story fitness center .
plenty of parking outside .
i had no expectations walking into this place .
the quality was really good for a buffet .
"yes , i said bbq pork bun ."
try it and you be the judge .
environment : it actually looks pretty nice in here .
americanized menu is much cheaper .
service : decent service .
looks much nicer inside than surrounding area .
food : i ordered scallops and a beer .
environment : great first date spot .
good food with loud vibes .
price : $ 00 - $ 00 per head .
service : attentive staff .
makes a good date location .
price : average price for the type of food .
food : hand pulled noodles !
service : very plain robotic service .
nothing stood out of the ordinary .
price : fairly well priced .
two dishes ended up being less than $ 00 .
this place is very very old .
the food taste very good .
as good as it gets .
i got the carne asada plate .
you have to try it .
my drink was also an additional 0.00 .
but the portion size are just average .
first off the service is top knot ch .
the food is fantastic .
overall i say give it a chance .
these are good people with good food .
i am a regular maybe you will be too .
wings are tasty and many different flavors .
our beers cold you cant go wrong with kirin !
go figure spicy to a phoenix resident !
fries were soggy and over salted .
mayo condiment very salty .
burger was ok kind of cold .
"grain feed , organic i get it ."
first of all this place is over priced .
i had the garlic chicken which was nothing special .
overall i would say avoid this one .
the food is good .
its kind of like they struggle to keep up .
but other then that i would avoid .
what can i say about mi <UNK> mi <UNK> .
our appetizer was a south american potato salad .
the steak was very tender and flavorful .
for authentic south american food go here .
if you want to try something new go here .
the bbq is pretty good .
stick with chicken and you wont be disappointed .
hidden gem of chinese food in the valley .
this place is very good .
its best described as a start up sports bar .
the prices are pretty good for a new place .
we got the hot wings which were very good .
food good but overpriced .
it is what it is .
the food is good .
as good as pei wei gets .
get your pei wei on .
i <UNK> extremely high hopes for this steak house .
for kobe beef it sure tasted about average .
the baked mac and cheese was great .
this side was full of flavor no complaints .
this is where my whole meal got ruined .
for starters i got my steak medium rare .
overall for the value i would avoid this place .
<UNK> are great footlong panini ' s <UNK> .
fresh lettuce and dressings .
the owners are really friendly also .
butter creme frosting is the best in town .
the hummus was good also .
avoid at all cost .
they let it sit there until it gets eaten .
this place was packed .
we also ordered some fried alligator as an appetizer .
the presentation was also nice not messy or greasy .
for an expensive dinner this place is worth it .
i had the red chili plate .
food was nothing special .
what a fun place in scottsdale .
on the plus side the food was very good .
now onto the most important part the bbq .
the portion size was good .
0 strips maybe 0 or 0 inches long .
but not this place .
so i would recommend these over regular fries .
overall two thumbs down .
i would eat here again in a heart beat .
the plate comes with three .
it almost feels like eating in someones house .
try something new and go here .
the brisket here is awesome !
the ribs are very good !
not as big as <UNK> bbq but still good .
you will not be disappointed .
this place is not for calorie watchers .
the sauces are awesome too .
the whisky ' s were very smooth .
they have a few different types of eating areas .
- lrb - hard to describe - rrb - .
we both shared some duck fat fries .
now to the burger .
the burger was juicy and the topping succulent .
this burger will blow you away .
this la <UNK> is ok .
the chip area is a mess .
bs you make that stuff in the morning .
i know how it works back in the kitchen .
vietnamese food in glendale ?
holy crap this place was fantastic .
and yes you can get vietnamese beer here .
which was just awesome .
the broth is fantastic .
talk about mexican comfort food .
i ca n't even tell how good this was .
this place is good .
come here for lunch and give it a chance .
oh and they do have beer .
cheap prices and unique items ?
what are you talking about ?
they have 00 cent specials everyday on good products .
they always have the best meats .
why break the bank .
craving a burger from the grill ?
the food is awesome .
but thats a good thing .
the condiment bar is pretty cool .
the fried fair is good .
the chicken sandwich is also good .
will be back for another burger .
get the double size .
the wine <UNK> are good i recommend the italian !
the lines look long but they go fast .
the free full service car wash is a plus .
the food was excellent .
the torta was excellent mix of southwest and american .
now the reason for the 0 star .
it was simply chance that brought me here .
my wife ' s salad was amazing .
that is n't the case .
nothing special nothing great .
first off the service is lousy .
this place is not that big .
the corn beef was good .
my fiance got 0 eggs 0 pancakes and sausage .
the food was ok nothing fancy .
the sign above list in order of toppings .

the food is pretty good .
the food was awesome .
the grill taste is indescribable .
overall very good i was impressed .
which i have n't done in a long time .
the service was outstanding and friendly .
the food was good and tasty .

we mentioned our complaints to the waiter and manager .
two thumbs way down .
our hot pot was freaking awesome .
the pineapple thing was very much an american creation .
she suggested this as it was very popular .
after getting it i can see why .
first off the sushi portions are terrible .

mark truly cares about you as an individual .
horrible and $ 0 down the drain .
"the concept , design and table wares are fantastic ."
the pizza was no where to be found .

this franchise will not survive in this neighborhood .

maybe they ' re distracted by <UNK> or math .

some menu items seem over prepared for tex-mex food .
excellent price to quality ratio .
one size = medium / large .
they load on the fresh / quality toppings .

children under 00 years are not allowed .
what is there left to say about la banquise .
its a pretty iconic place in mtl .

the flavour selection is large and delicious .
the names is a great description in itself .
bar services is good and quick .
beer and cider choices are decent .
if your thinking of heading here do n't .
this place has closed .
the food seemed to keep on coming and <UNK> .

simple brew pub in montreal .
price is good for what you get .
the coffee service was less than desirable as well .

well at least in the summer .
i ' m not sure what that was about .
especially nice when you need to cure that hangover .
probably the best inexpensive diner in the area .
the waiting staff are friendly and quick .
i want the good stuff .
i have mixed feeling about <UNK> .
this place is simple and down to earth .
the service level is way off .
hope they fix this .
this is real chicago style pizza .
"also , nice job on the remodel ."
much improved layout of the service department .
"beware , it ' s cheap for a reason ."
let ' s start with check-in .
they pull this : clerk : you wanted non-smoking ?
"me : fine , smoking then ."
"think less nice hotel , and more fair motel ."
dated is a word one reviewer used .
"i prefer the term , garage sale ."
the furniture kinda matches .
"also , cans , not bottles ."
then you ' ll love browsing at the rio !
tip : use chrome to connect initially here .
every other <UNK> <UNK> on the load up page .
the restaurants are sub-par at best .
"well , they keep it old school here ."
"in short , not worth the money ."
good hawaiian barbeque with some interesting selections .
i tried the mixed bbq and the chicken katsu .
about as lackluster as bbq gets .
bradley ogden is a fantastic restaurant .
the food so far has been outstanding .
the garlic chick alfredo was a big hit .
the pub burgers are really great .
finding bouchon can be a challenge .
i have had much better at much lesser restaurants .
"they picked my car up , which was cool ."
and these were very visible areas .
really not happy with the place .
and the service was practically non-existent .
and do not attempt take out .
and they genuinely do n't concern themselves about this .
the manager is about as apathetic as can be .
"i admit , i can be a pizza snob ."
"very , very , very bad ."
the sausage on the other hand ... insane !
but the real treat is the pork belly bao .
the m had a fantastic rate of $ 00 .
the steaks were among the best in the city .
"not much to be said here , they suck ."
"if you use them , you know they suck ."
it really made for a great meal .
but then the steak came .
the whole meal was sort of so-so .
the staff seemed on edge .
i think this is an excellent place for chinese .
but the bbq pork is top notch .
both came with better than average hash browns .
both were very good .
decent place to grab some wings or a burger .
i had my first foot massage in hong kong .
so i guess we just considered it a tip .
the decor is very cool and casual .
the sausage also tasted cheap .

i enjoy this place .
it ' s run by some nice people .

the parfaits are very good too .
service is prompt and attentive .
"amazing chicken , however , not much flavor ."
way better than <UNK> b ' s .

this review is solely based on those three items .
"for what it is , it ' s great ."
where this place really shines is in their salads .
i guess the food was pretty good .
i got the ribs and loved it .
"the sauce was slightly hot , sweet and vinegary ."
the pho broth was standard and good .
they do include <UNK> and basil .
<UNK> yeah dig it .

"my opinion , not worth the price ."
i asked our waitress for her recommendations .

' ' i answered exactly as i mentioned above .
"again , i assured her the steak was good ."
"grilled chicken , lightly cooked peppers , etc . ."
they do do chips very well here .
bouchon was the right choice .
this place is as good as it gets .

very good mexican cuisine .
guacomole was also very good .
carne asada was excellent .
the place has a good vibe .
"the food , phenomenal ."
this is a plus for scottsdale .
not a friendly place .
the lodge is the place to go in scottsdale .
seats are very tight .
what an incredible experience .
- the pillows were substandard .
old country buffet at twice the price .
"however , that was n't the case ."
the pizza made domino ' s look gourmet .
burrito with chorizo had far too much chorizo .
not conducive to a good time .
ate here a couple sunday nights ago .
several areas of improvement are needed .
first off it was freezing cold in the place .
secondly the pepperoni pizza was unremarkable .
the cashier was very friendly .
two big thumbs down on this pizza joint .
very poor management frequently changing hands .
"high employee turn over , not the friendliest ."
"helicopters always fly over head , sirens 00/0 ."
maintenance men smoke in the closed in hallways smelly .
high resident turn over .
noise carries all over complex from floor to floor .
management not responsive to problems .
ordered the philly cheese steak .
the cheese ended up <UNK> to the paper wrap .
the bread was average .
fun decor and a real laid back atmosphere .
if you want to try different guns !
my <UNK> had a burger .
"just horrible and way , way , way overpriced ."
do n't buy any food in the park .
"oh yeah , $ 00 by the way ."
they also deliver within a reasonable distance .
"fresh food , clean premises , great tastes !"
"excellent food , reasonable prices , good service ."
the best car purchase experience bar none !
i told her my food is now cold .
one star but they should have none .
they do one order at a time .
the brisket sandwich is very good .
the three different sauces are tasty .
i did not try the grits .
this was good food .
for this type of place there is not problem .
by the way they have three types .
too expensive for lunch .
"tender and full of flavor , ."
i went last night for ribs .
they surely need a make over .
"wonderful good flavor , and plenty of food ."
i will be going back .
they also have the normal hamburgers ribs and links .
i think he did an excellent job .
they have a <UNK> coupon and good pricing .
i ordered a 00 oz <UNK> rare .
meals took about another 00 minutes .
my wife & i come to <UNK> frequently .
the food and coffee are very good and plentiful .
their food is heavy calorie wise .
other restaurants that did not did not survive .
no wonder these guys are the worlds largest .
used one in europe recently with my kitchener membership .
"wow , the best chile relleno i ever had !"
well it was not worth the wait .
my wife ' s scallops were over salted too .
you wo n't regret it .
the service is inconsistent .
great atmosphere and great food .
i would highly recommend <UNK> .
for the price the food is excellent .
the service is second to none .
i would highly recommend the <UNK> restaurant .
guys ! ! ! do n't waste your time .
avoid this place at all costs .
this place was full of dudes .
me and my wife visit vegas alot !
drinks are almost 0 dollars .
pros : food came quick .
the burger was not that bad .
so 00 bucks down the drain basically .
the service is quick and friendly .
the taste is ok !
had an awesome pie at the end .
ed will take care of you .
the layout seems better then marquee .
members their rack the weight they use .
"normally i dislike cooked fish , <UNK> chinese steamed ."
they left cleaning solution in the room .
room was better then avg .
the beds were great .
the gym was nicely equipped for us gym junkies .
had a buddy who ' s a vegas <UNK> .
"got a bit late , and hungry ."
but that ' s about it .
lisa really brings the kiosk to life though .
i had seared tuna as an appetizer .
the tuna was fantastic .
my goodness that is a great tasting soup .
the fillet had the consistency of sushi grade tuna .
that is high praise coming from her .
i actually love the beer .
i am not a big fan of miso anyway .
"great job , chase !"
"that could just be a coincidence , i suppose ."
still this is no way to treat their customers .
it shows that the management does not care .
this is a 0 star place .
but the accident apparently changed everything .
"problem is , my name ' s not <UNK> ."
highly suggest garlic chicken and house special beef .
i go here for lunch 0-0 times a month .
- rrb - fast food with a nice staff .
veal sausage meatballs are awesome !
go to peoria hyundai they are very nice there .
management has no clue what they are doing .
guys got in after 00 minutes .
i kept going back for cheese and savory <UNK> !
the coach house meets all the requirements .
what else does one need .
love spicy food and this place delivers .
the relleno de carne adovada being my favorite choice .
decent place to get your car washed .
pricing was decent and also very straight forward .
food is spicy and good .
the atmosphere is also pleasant and nice .
i had a decent burger with fries .
food was middle of the road .
it ' s authentic cookin ' and extremely tasty .
fish and 0 sides .
sides were collard greens and navy beans .
but keep that box on your bucket list <UNK> .
but the flavor was rather bland and uninspiring .
"0 star bar , 0 star restaurant ."
the crab tacos were also great .
"good atmosphere , and a decent beer selection ."
"like most breakfast buffets , this one is overpriced ."
another nice touch was the silverware .
the food was spectacular as on my first visit .
i found getting out of the arena was good .
parking was descent in the back .
she was very prompt despite the large crowd .
the selection was good and most tasted really good .
get a pen and write it on the calendar .
the coke i think was straight from the can .
this was straight <UNK> dinning and a nice atmosphere .
the good is also great .
ipa are all good .
the bar area is small .
it was excellent and i definitely recommend it .
"nice bourbon smell , but not over powering ."
both beers totaled $ 00 .
i stopped in for lunch during the work week .
i win that battle 0 times out of 00 .
and the doughnut things on the way out ?
"good service , good food , and good beers ."
"for me , it is always average ."
"nothing bad , but nothing spectacular ."
i arrived tonight to a 00 minute wait .
the service was very good .
sure - the choices are limited in qc .
will i enjoy it ?
bravo to the bosses for picking this place .
the beans were fairly standard beans .
a couple of bartenders there to keep it moving .
good selection of beer in the cooler .
"always good service , quick , and descent priced ."
convenient location in queen creek .
soon after i arrived it started getting busier .
the menu indicated no newspaper - which is fine .
the special was 00 cents of a draught .
just a size comparison - the taste was fine .
i agree with <UNK> - surprisingly good .
"all in all , a good trip ."
"0 buffets with 0 soft drinks , $ 00.00 ."
either way they were good .
so i dressed accordingly .
it was n't crowded yet .
getting up at 0 would really suck .
"take that , rachael ray ."
seating is limited inside - just two tables .
"either way , it was excellent ."
the bartenders were plentiful and always busy .
"<UNK> into the area below , i was impressed ."
not bad for the $ 0 price tag .
there were also beers on tap to try .
it was an espresso roasted dark ale .
excellent craft beer selection with 00 taps .
good establishment to try something new .
but i realize i am in the minority .
he found it to be tasteful and spicy .
"the food quality was okay , but nothing special ."
is there anything better than oregano ' s ?
good happy hour prices on drinks and sliders .
give it up to the waffle house cooks .
"it gave the restaurant a nice , homey feel ."
the dish was among the best i have had .
i took one home for future <UNK> .
i ordered the wings and a <UNK> beer .
a very good mix and all have been friendly .
next thing to arrive was the trout .
good food and the service was n't bad either .
thankfully real ice cream has arrived in queen creek .
the prior reviews were on the money .
the waffle and the chicken were very filling .
lolo ' s is off the <UNK> fo <UNK> !
a brand new brewery opened in town recently .
maybe best to eat there .
i went with the sirloin and ordered it medium .
now the waitress was n't to be found .
once again it turned out to be true .
one thing i appreciated was his concern for cost .
the music was soothing and the ladies were excellent .
knowledgeable staff helpful with answers to questions .
is the pizza good ?
by group i would say more than 0 .
"first , a positive note ."
it is more or less a volcano taco salad .
what are they doing back there with the tacos ?
that many people in just a few minutes ?
that would speed up the line .
i left a nice tip for his efforts .
"good job , <UNK> ."
i ca n't recall much about this place .
i was also surprised with the cowboy beans .
the pork was good .
but all in all it was a nice place .
the fries are excellent also with a nice seasoning .
that might draw a crowd .
"$ 0.00 per slice , but well worth it ."
the food is overpriced and <UNK> .
pre-packaged is also a good choice .
those are all descent choices .
i would recommend finding a smaller local establishment .
the final building is the small museum .
i went yesterday and it was a ghost town .
after a while it was only us remaining .
it was surprisingly close .
our server was prompt and stopped by frequently .
i have to say the bread was excellent .
not bad for $ 00.00 .
guess who ' s got lunch ?
i enjoy the keg .
the desserts were excellent .
the menu has changed and was fairly big .
another waiter passing by said ` ` bad !
i also stayed for the beer stein competition .
i had three boots of the oktoberfest blend .
but i <UNK> and ordered from the dollar menu .
i was daring and gave it a shot .
yesterday i attempted to complete the exchange .
"thanks for nothing , spirit ."
i found it to be tender and juicy .
the lady rang it up and said $ 0.00 .
should n't the combo be a standard item ?
i want it at lunch .
the restaurant has a nice appearance .
everyone else there was an employee .
i went with the recommended whale ale .
the place was cool and the beer was good .
anyone want to tag along ?
eventually three more tables showed up .
it features what is called the north american 00 .
the interior was spacious and great seating .
the bread was excellent !
"first , parking is challenging ."
another issue is ticketing .
traffic issues are not limited to the street .
the cheese cake was $ 0.00 for the slice .
the company has a good reputation .
a fairly underwhelming selection of football products .
i go here at least once a week .
". which really , why is it limited time ?"
it is mixed with shell pasta and very tasty .
"damn , i feel like a fat pig ."
the jalapenos were not noticeable .
they have good food and great beer .
the rest is about your average steakhouse .
the staff is always friendly and knowledgable .
"00 minutes , 00 minutes , 00 minutes ."
i said how about a second set of silverware .
we also never received the second set of silverware .
for an irish bar this is your black friday .
the soda selection was another interesting feature .
my first experience here will not be my last .
typically i stop in for a <UNK> protein shake .
give it a shot .
otherwise it is expensive .
i went yesterday and had a few beers .
typical bar food - nothing special .
the staff was fast and friendly .
i stopped by this place for the first time .
both meals were very good as well .
i picked up a bottle of <UNK> as well .
"a nice little place now , but growing ."
the fries are good - cajun flavor and spicy .
say a few words and dive back in .
the fries are too much too .
another indicator is the level of <UNK> .
"yes , the alternative would require both utensils ."
the flavor was excellent .
and the brownie ... but i refrained .
the price was $ 00 .
the draft beer section is limited .
you wo n't be disappointed !
"no food , but nice beers and cheap drinks ."
when i checked out the bartender said $ 0.00 .
and they had dance dance revolution !
"mighty , mighty mercury , indeed !"
the french fries were very good .
now i can cross that task off my list .
the staff was very friendly .
i started with both .
the fries were typical fries .
the meal was excellent .
$ 00.00 for the shark skewers .
"i revisited red , white & brew on friday ."
friday was no exception .
the food continued to be good .
first thing you notice is the smell .
the guy said you mean drink it ?
good luck surviving the recession .
google turned up similarly named restaurants in other places .
the waitress that i had was also very new .
the fish filet was another highlight of the meal .
the meal included fries and two pieces of fish .
looking down at the second piece - holy cow !
we did receive two sleeves of baguettes .
quick seating and good service .
the pizza itself was about $ 00 .
the price could rise quickly depending on the toppings .
"comfortable atmosphere , good service and good pizza ."
the hashbrown and eggs were average fare .
i had to scrape it off to the side .
cadillac ranch is more bar than restaurant .
"thanks , cadillac ranch , but no thanks ."
that price is only good at the bar .
total price $ 00 .
the pineapple aqua fresca is excellent as well .
the restaurant had several employees working as well .
the ranch dressing continued the time warp .
the chicken was moist and had a great flavor .
each of these requests had to be repeated twice .
the issues with slow and incorrect service remained .
the burgers now come with the endless fries .
i found the fries to be very good .
i ordered a sonoran hot dog for $ 0.00 .
the other location has fluorescent lighting in the coolers .
it is new and the clientele will be different .
i likely will go to both locations .
i ordered the french ass burger .
"on the downside , it is cash only ."
"speaking of large , the menu was expansive ."
the soup came out almost immediately .
... before i could give the specifics .
i stopped by last thursday after a lengthy absence .
"the food was good , but fairly average ."
some memories are best kept as that .
plenty of parking and good seating inside .
i would probably give it another try .
this restaurant would fit in either location .
"i went with the three tacos , carne asada ."
the lack of <UNK> is not limited to jack .
just order a number .
that ' s why its there .
as large as it is it is surprisingly quiet .
at least the mountains provided a good view .
to be honest the salad is a bit scary .
"it was very good , but also very large ."
i ate about half of it and was finished .
the price was good for that dish at 00.00 .
not really feeling the clientele .
really the best part of the meal .
the service was excellent .
i visited san tan looking for information .
the <UNK> was very good - sweet and fruity .
each <UNK> was $ 0.00 and well worth it .
good fries and a satisfying beer .
both commented on how good it was .
at least i got to see the football game .
the atmosphere a little dead .
the service was excellent .
"they are smaller portions , but good for lunch ."
i like going to the gammage .
the air conditioning was on and felt good .
the atmosphere was naturally very loud .
how about kilt lifter ?
"the more you drink , the cheaper it is ?"
an order of 00 wings was $ 0.00 .
"maybe warm , but closer to room temperature ."
the evening turned out to be a good time .
i walked in and was promptly seated .
instead it was a plate of pulled various meet .
the sweet potato fries appeared to be frozen .
the server had limited personality .
the rest remained on the table .
this was no exception .
i bought the warranty at the time .
plus they had some sweet salsa music playing inside .
the finish was the same location .
this year was the b - 00 ' s .
the highlight for me is the carrot raisin bread .
the service was very good .
few seating options might be the drawback .
i went with the applewood smoked pecan salmon .
the pizza itself was just okay for me .
i asked if i would be sent a bill .
let me set that up for you .
all drinks are served in a mason jar .
driving to the airport is easy .
the terminals are not user friendly .
they brought out something and sat on the table .
next up was the prime rib french dip sandwich .
"but otherwise , excellent ."
"not just in arizona , but around the country ."
the staff was somewhat dressed .
the water for my beverage was a good choice .
get the free vip card and save 00 % .
always crowded at lunch .
some pros and cons .
"third time and its a trend , right ?"
i had lunch here with a coworker .
i ordered the reuben pasty and it was good .
"otherwise , it was a pleasant accidental finding ."
it was a good and interesting blend .
big props to the staff .
i took the bud .
the service was good and the food arrived quickly .
i would certainly go here every opportunity i had .
$ 0 for a large beer sounded good .
"again , the prior reviews led the way ."
the early days were a little rough at times .
the theater and the show were excellent .
supporting local performing arts is very important .
the arizona theater company is definitely a local treasure .
a very large selection of treats to choose from .
a slice or two always hit the spot .
awesome atmosphere and a unique place to go .
it was dark inside and mostly dead .
that did n't really increase the crowd .
that was just an elevator .
"for lunch , the answer was brio ."
good value with the combo .
it is for research after all .
good deal if you have trouble deciding .
definite happy finish with the dessert .
the displeasure of the <UNK> occurred upon check out .
"after the final <UNK> , her attitude changed ."
she tossed the pen beside it .
"once again , right on the money ."
"after my initial visit , i can not disagree ."
for chinese restaurants it is the general tso .
definitely give this place a shot .
it definitely is queen creek ' s best chinese .
the store is large and laid out well .
plenty of costume options for every size and style .
stop in now and avoid the rush .
probably 00 minutes later mine arrived .
"i said no , those are both mine ."
nice feel to the place .
i went with the bourbon french toast .
the food this year was weak .
"admittedly , i had not ."
there were four guys in close proximity to me .
what about the good things ?
good thing 0 : it ' s large .
the people were the most interesting part .
maybe it was an urban legend ?
it was incredible and had an excellent flavor .
- lrb - and cheap - rrb - .
the <UNK> chicken is what my friend usually orders .
most of these read guinness .
wednesday evenings are another good night .
it was also much quieter than other places .
the food arrived very quickly .
a pale beer with great flavor and nice finish .
thanks george for the recommendation !
this was my second trip to costa vida .
the meats are good and the veggies fresh .
the atmosphere in the concert hall was amazing .
the red and green sauce is amazing .
the burrito is large and filling .
the tacos are excellent .
multiple parking places up front and on each side .
so what ' s with the wait ?
my 0 minutes turned into closer to 00 .
queen creek i said .
"well , really from ohio ."
is n't an airplane a form of time travel ?
you can make the same journey in 0 hours .
nice addition to the <UNK> campus .
cheese available in american or pepper jack .
the pint is usually around $ 0 .
these may be the best wings in <UNK> valley .
pick up the free chips at the counter .
a lot of traffic in this area .
so why then is the bar usually empty ?
instead it was dudes in <UNK> .
i also finished off two waters .
very nice guy too .
behind the brewery is very limited .
it was $ 0 for the beer .
there was a band called whiskey drunk that performed .
one of the downsides was limited seating .
this place is hoping on the weekends for sure .
i started with a stout and it was excellent .
today was the big day for the installation .
i will say the process was cool and different .
a second piece was better .
the wine presented a nice sampling .
the atmosphere of the restaurant was excellent .
unfortunately i did not get to experience these things .
"also , no credit cards at lunch ."
sandwich quality is inconsistent from visit to visit .
quality seems to depend upon who is working .
the service was excellent .
most food was quite good .
you have been warned .
my wife and i love it .
this must be a joke .
thanks donna you ' re awsome
great staff and great food .
the famous schwartz ' s definitely does n't disappoint .
there must have been literally near 000 different kinds .
overall still a good experience .
so it ' s new years day .

everything fresh nothing frozen .
"your pancakes are cold , etc . ."
charged me for it anyways .
it ' s everytime i come here .

"after all , i work hard for my money ."
take it from my stomach .

0st car was a 00 ' cadillac <UNK> .
0nd car was a 00 ' <UNK> .
0rd car 00 ' mustang <UNK> .
"pretty packed on the weekends , great music ."

they ' d rather stand around and talk .
first $ 00 then $ 00 ?
this is the best bbq joint ever .
"nonetheless , these burgers are amazing ."
i had a cheesesteak and 0 wings .
the cheesesteak was n't too good .
it was cold in some spots .

nice hotel and casino bad customer service .
the drinks were ok at best .
portions are large also .
really good food for the money .
best money i have ever spent on a show .
should have searched yelp before eating here .
agree with ` <UNK> .
"price is one thing , but quality should match ."
lobster <UNK> was best of the worst .
salt <UNK> out most of fish flavor in dishes .

i guess the experience seemed corporate to me .
huge selection of guns !
huge selection of guns !
specialty drinks all very good .
had a hard time actually getting a beer .
really long time between courses .
was at the red rock casino location .
overall a good stay so far .
as a los angeles resident .
this place is terrible .
"long story short : hire this man , asap ."
it was in need of a complete facelift .
i was looking for coolant for my truck .
this is the worst branch ever .
even in late night the place is full .
they have to make this place bigger .
let me just say this ... the hype ?
chris bianco brings pizza to a new level .
i ' m just sayin ' .
"nicely decorated , with friendly staff ."
there was a welcome absence of <UNK> .
i ' ll be back for sure .
fresh tentacles and tube rounds in a light coating .
entree - crab cake platter .
the best you can get .

this spacious room was the bar .

our next trip here will be very soon .

he arrived and brought a serious attitude with him .
very unassuming and quiet looking outside at the front .
the dining room is surprisingly big .
we opted for the <UNK> special .
that was money well spent .
fries in different sizes plus sweet potato fries .
we like it and keep going back .
best time = late afternoon .
"serenity , then <UNK> - pow food gets you ."
it gets a bill a + .
"not for dogs , for us ."

amazing costumes on the ladies though .
i ordered a hawaiian chicken burger .
lots of medieval water <UNK> and statues .
ceilings painted blue that resembles the sky .
there are four <UNK> areas .
this is just another typical all-american style mall .
go here at night .

his name is robert .
the best food around .
even when good food was cheap on the strip .
the vip servers just seem more nice and attentive .
the service was great .
they did the job exactly as they described .
"no problems , no hassles and price as quoted ."

i refer any friends or family to first choice .
fairly overly priced for the place .
<UNK> with a monopoly on energy .
a solid three stars from me .
close to major <UNK> .
- lrb - did i mention that already ?
"construction quality is imho , very poor ."
cell reception : poor inside the complex itself .
this place is always good .
"$ 00 first visit , $ 00 thereafter ."
i was completely floored by this guys behavior .
"during the day , it ' s packed ."
the heat alone <UNK> your ass up .
00-00 minutes go by .
"attempt # 0 , failed ."
you get a separate line from the regular line .
same rules apply though .
the food is good but not great .
this really bumps up your expectations .
our hostess - lrb - melissa ?
bottle pricing breakdown : <UNK> one $ 000 .
not much going on back here .
non-smoking should not be request .
it should be standard .
that coming from a club ?
i ' ll be back .

filet mignon - just ok .
so all that for about $ 00 including tip ?
stop with the fake asian inspired menus .
the food itself or the service and food presentation ?
"a few more words , expensive food court food ."
"ok , the place is very nice ."
the service is excellent .
it ' s supposed to be dry and rubbery ?

$ 00 for 0 people .
rice dishes are n't bad .
- oxtail fried rice is also good .
- fish sauce wings were ok .
the <UNK> of the dish was spectacular .
the lamb itself was cooked perfectly .
i ate at the one inside venetian .
portions are pretty big .
every burger was probably the best burger ever .
shaded <UNK> did an amazing job on my truck .
a tuna sandwich ? ? ? really ?
kind of a hipster vibe now .
the food is still great .
i went in mid august 0000 .
"but <UNK> , i ' m a busy guy ."
but besides that everything was great .
the taste of meat is inconsistent .
at $ 00 / plate it seems fair .
do you think he ever called back ?
one reviewer is from california !
avoid this company at all costs !
the good thing about this is the location .
there is something special about the pancakes here .
obviously the best arena in pittsburgh .
this place kicks a $ $ !

my meal cost $ 0.00 before tax .
"especially , worth a trip when its coupon time ."

very professional and removed the spots and pets stains .
nice - top notch server there .
$ 0 for a flat pepsi ?
"the servers are all super cool , especially annie ."
what a sad little buffet .
nobody is expecting perfection .
<UNK> by the offerings of the big box stores .

my wife and i love the simplicity and appearance .
"joe , thank you !"
jeff b . walked in and immediately seated outside .
stuffed poblano and a burrito in 00 minutes .
highly recommend this place .
courteous and intuitive staff .
. the atmosphere is unlike any other starbucks .
not sure what you want or need ?
<UNK> - oh baby bring it on .
outrageous would be a good word .
celine is all of that and effortless on stage .
cheers your newest fan .
0 - rrb - presentation was deplorable .
other dishes in the past have also fallen short .
sorry kung fu plaza .
the only one close is israel @user the barrymore .
we skipped dessert so ca n't comment .
<UNK> dome tickets with a steak prior .
super succulent and delicious .
"great flavor , really really juicy and plump ."

this falafel is the real deal .
"very laid back , cheap and inviting ."

probably one of the best out there .
but try it as a meal .
let me explain the 0 stars .

i seem to keep going there .
that and a cup of joe .

i have been visiting this location for years .
"great mexican food , at an awesome price ."
the bagel sandwich i got was relatively lackluster .
good place to kill time .
there is also a blue burrito grill past security .
those are great for airport food .
we all know waiting at airports can suck .
i still feel that this is a great airport .
i guess that is a fair criticism .
one of the strangest places i have been to .
i traveled through gila bend a few years later .
the space age had burned to the ground .
they did rebuild the space age .
which <UNK> well for travelers between phoenix and socal .

the sushi was really damn good for a buffet .
so was the rest of the food .
the atmosphere feels authentic and inviting .

i had the three meat omelet .
service was pretty good too .
i would recommended this location .
this was not the case at pima dental .
service was very good all around .
i will admit the food is slightly pricier here .
it seemed somewhat busy .
the buffet line consists of the main breakfast staples .
about a dozen items .
nothing flashy or extravagant .
although i know that offer has just recently ended .
went here for a co-workers grad party .
frequently the casino even more .
- rooms are larger than the average hotel room .
- parking is ample .
priority parking for local diamond / seven star members .
the room prices are in mid range .
decor is kinda like somewhere between casual and upscale .
juice was dripping outta my burger .
overall still a decent meal .
i decided on the spicy miso burger .
"little spicy , the subtle savory flavor of miso ."
these guys are two nuts .
"prices seemed reasonable , not cheap but ok ."
i settled on black bean noodles .
side dishes were slightly different this time .
it almost doubles the seating capacity .
service can take longer at times .
the actual hotel and casino itself is pretty nice .
unfortunately the two times i used valet .
the selection is quite large .
one item offered once was ginger stir-fried crab legs .
overall those visits were ok .
specifically regarding the poker room .
dumb move on my part .
the spot is pretty plain in decor .
a couple tables and chairs .
a big white seal logo - lrb - ?
not even a cash register .
theres a machine that <UNK> ice .
i ' d normally think windshield tint unnecessary .
keeping cool and tint looks great .
tried this place twice last week .
"the decor and ambiance was ok , nothing spectacular ."
we asked some questions <UNK> to menu .
i ordered beef with black mushrooms .
the fried rice was decent .
have n't been here in quite some years .
the website does post all of the deals .
overall nothing spectacular but nothing horrible either .
i do n't usually review supermarkets .
no complaints of the store itself .
it ' s like an interactive electronic museum .
surprisingly decent food for a bar .
diamond check-in was quick .
i had a room in the newly renovated tower .
north tower i believe ?
"staff are friendly , courteous ."
selection of games & dining spots are decent .
"ok , no big deal ."
aside from that the burger & fries were good .
been here a handful of times .
overall service and food was right on .
went here with a group of friends in november .
the club itself is pretty huge .
the look was pretty cool throughout .
the house dj list is impressive too .
also the stairs are killer .
like all clubs on the strip .
"nothing fancy , no frills ."
place was reasonably clean .
the spot looked nice enough .
it was almost as wide as it was long .
the burrito alone probably would have sufficed .
went with friend and his wife for dinner .
ordered the miso ramen .
this interesting concept is a first for i .
would recommend to anyone needing appliance installations done .
even then the service was pretty spotty .
definitely earns a 0 star rating in my book !
"food is decent , fairly large selection ."
so still pricey but not exorbitant .
i had the <UNK> .
just a different expectation i suppose .
the meatloaf seemed a little bland .
the service was very good .
i give this place a solid 0.0 stars .
could n't quite give it the nudge to 0 .
those might be worth trying another time .
peppered with a little tongue in between .
another good reason to come to oyshi .
but our visit tonight is definitely worth mentioning .
below with the egg noodles .
drinks refilled before the current one is empty .
found in red rock hotel & casino in summerlin .
reasonable price for a decent buffet .
it carries a pretty large selection .
"one year expiration , oh wells lol ."
the place is fairly small .
i had the seared salmon salad .
the dressing was a bit salty .
service was very good .
a decent place to get your sushi fill .
i was sitting on 0.0 stars for this place .
- rrb - bowls to drink from .
this place gets a solid 0.0 stars .
it ' s been always a great breakfast spot .
always crispy and hot .
friendly and attentive staff .
"chicken , nice , tender & juicy inside ."
yes i know what some of you are thinking .
the place itself isnt too big .
menu is pretty simple and straightforward .
nothing mind blowing but not horrible either .
service was friendly overall .
since that first time was good .
it ' s not a large shop .
for the most part its a fairly decent buffet .
but it was deceptive .
the place turned out to be bigger .
checked upon often and drinks refilled .
inflation must be hitting this place pretty hard .
the food quality was pretty good .
still an ok time overall .
hard to beat the price at $ 0.00 .
the sausage and <UNK> on white sauce looked intriguing .
"nice and thin , crust was nice and chewy ."
"late review , trying to play catch up !"
the size of the burger was decent .
the burger patties themselves did seem a bit bland .
i was n't exactly blown away .
came here a couple weeks ago .
"nana <UNK> , hamachi sashimi ."
all you can eat soup & salad bar .
but still try out this place at least once .
"toasted crusty bread with evoo tho , very good ."
dessert was the walnut pie with <UNK> ice cream .
service for the most part was good .
the <UNK> with sausage .
pizza was good as i remember it .
$ 00 for a large .
this tgif is located inside the orleans casino .
$ 0 appetizers <UNK> for seafood and samplers .
though it turns out that was n't the case .
"when considering overall atmosphere , service and action ."
a few song numbers .
"the place seemed nice and open , clean ."
the selection is decent .
i did notice for lunch the price is cheaper .
will have to maybe try lunch one day .
"the bread basket is crazy , for starters ."
i had the 00oz filet mignon on the bone .
cooked and seasoned perfectly .
for our party of five .
suffice to say we all left full and satisfied .
place looked clean enough and prices reasonable .
been here about 00 times now .
service except for one time was very good .
food for the most part is well above average .
low light and upscale looking .
the original restaurant is well-known and famous in nyc .
located on the grounds of caesar ' s palace .
their signature frozen hot chocolate is crazy good .
located in front of the <UNK> hotel & casino .
it is known to be a romantic spot .
"good food , drinks and service ."

spiciness for each dish can be customized from 0-00 .
all the dishes tasted good .
prompt with taking orders and getting our food .

the restaurant is more than usually noisy .
the ambiance is also quite pleasant .
our primary server was helpful in making menu suggestions .
first and foremost frozen beer ! ! ! wow !
hole in the wall underneath ichiza and in chinatown .
best prime tongue i have ever had .
it was good but not heirloom tomatoes really ?
windmill location doesnt do that which is quite funny .
but not a big deal in my eyes .
always a good choice when looking for a burger .
mexican coke = always a winner .
food did not disappoint at all .
red shiny diner seats and booths on the side .
seemed like they had 00 different sodas .
pork belly and duck boa were both great .
cocktail list was small and simple but great options .

tv inside on espn always makes it better .
anyhow arrived early and table was ready .

the food was very good .
the next day the keys again did n't work .

brent the owner is truly top notch !
this location really gives bagel places a bad name .
i mean it this time .
price is about right for food quality .
everything is just good or lower average .
piazza environment is the best reason to eat here .
bread is always prepackaged burnt and cold .
the beds do seem like <UNK> rather than queen .

elegant on rectangular white ceramic dishes .
seven spice duck confit .
sauce was reminiscent of watered down beef condensed sauce .

finally they changed service in between our visit .
an introduction would have been nice .
not really sure what the difference is .
i purchased an iced <UNK> coffee .
no one else was in the restroom .
but the food was not spot on .

"american wagyu rib cap , medium rare ."
cocktail waitresses are decked out like parisian <UNK> .

we elected to wait until one was available .
service throughout the meal was satisfactory .
"ahhhh , the hard rock ."
the cocktail waitresses are among the best in vegas .

its cooked dishes were flavorful and seasoned with restraint .
"pho , ramen , or udon ?"
grilled and roasted meats ?
i had the smoked whiskey and coke .
i love scotch and enjoy rob <UNK> .
perhaps that ' s why the vanguard was empty .
the beef carpaccio was a traditional preparation and presentation .
the cheddar cheese sauce was far from velveeta .
"cuba libre , anyone ?"
0.0 stars ... rounding up to 0 .
check-in was quick and painless .

def good eats there !
it ' s pretty incredible .
they will overwhelm you with quantity not necessarily quality .
give it a shot and see .
it ' s damn good !
the servers are very friendly and ambiance is interesting .
overall a good little spot .
the french toast is great for breakfast .
they also messed up on the ingredients .

"mushy rice , frozen fish ."
why sushi for a french themed buffet ?
"as previous reviewers noted , service was slow ."
this place is the best .
i personally had basic spaghetti with marinara sauce .
all of that before two simple plates of spaghetti ?
this place is awesome .
that ' s what did me in for good .

this place is a winner .

do n't order the tagliatelle unless you like anise .
great venison burger and wonderful atmosphere !
nice irish pub in scotland .
you should absolutely go here to get your haircut .
it was downhill from there .
the sushi was dry and in some cases inedible .
"avoid this one , many better places around ."
instead of apologizing the manager started to become <UNK> .
have eaten there many times .
plenty for the money .
"good beer , good cigars , and good people ."
best tacos north of the border .
simple place with the focus on food .
"simply put , this place is the worst ."
honest people who do honest work .
"awesome , friendly people and really great tamales !"
"desert was enjoyable , best part of the meal ."
"great service , drinks , and huge portions ."
my burger came out .
one of the smallest burgers i have ever eaten .
i would suggest guido ' s !
' ' than a tasteful melody .
' ' perhaps i should have learned .
where was the management ?
"on the positive side , the bartender was descent ."
they had very nice quality food and good selection .
the buns were ok .
"today , flavors are more distinct and better balanced ."
cold night in phoenix .
what idiot thought up this policy ?
it ' s not a fire or safety risk .
obviously this is a more inexpensive operation to run .
then you should probably stay home .
there ' s not a mistake on the menu .
weekends are probably <UNK> .
i ' ll be back soon .
"the food is very good , flavorful and interesting ."
cocktails match the theme nicely and are well constructed .
and parking should continue to be a breeze .
cocktails were nice as well .
try the spring rolls .
- rrb - so it needed some extra attention .
"on top of that , the prices are fair ."
server was friendly and food came out pretty quick .
i had ribs and steak medallions .
a lot of gristle and fat .
wife had fried chicken .
called these guys to service my dishwasher .
installation quality was top shelf !
my most recent experience is a classic example .
so hopefully the third time will be the charm .
same scenario as before .
great pizza but service was well below average .
i ' ve only eaten there once .
i ' m an <UNK> and a big fisherman .
fun place to hang before sun devil football games .
good service and comfortable surroundings .
it reminds me a lot of quizno ' s .
the food was prepared quickly and it tasted great .
the personal service here is unmatched .
today was my first visit to little spoon .
perfect salty and sweet combination .
strawberry / chocolate crepe was amazing .
enjoyed a birthday lunch here with my girlfriend .
my 00oz ny strip was good but not great .
best i can describe it is chinese with curry .
i will be coming back .
paid $ 00 on chicken <UNK> .
think about it for a second .
although predictable it ' s really tasty .
i loved your dj .
they do it right and the hype is true .
what more can i say ?
get a window seat .
it was terrific food .
the club is not impressive .
the food is very good .
horrible from the very moment i walked in .
this place is a joke .
nice location and atmosphere .
this is a really great place for a coffee .
a great selection of music is always on .
"nevertheless , its an undeniably cool venue ."
"value , value , value ."
bonus points for not having any gambling .
"the rest of the menu looked great , too ."
"but today , the service was actually very good ."
but the stars of the show are the shakes .
my steak was lukewarm at best and under seasoned .
my wife steak was overcooked .
two issues : 0 .
sides are family style .
the sides where a good companion to the steaks .
big ass eggroll was on top !
"do not , for any <UNK> use this airline !"
cool place to be .
the nachos can be split among 0-0 people easy .
the tartare did not disappoint !
had a perfect flavor and smooth texture to it .
great flavor and great presentation .
perfect mixture and had a very strong rye taste .
nothing completely outstanding though .
just three varieties of meat with bread .
the pizza was outstanding .
the bread pudding was perfect .
"it was light , not heavy at all ."
but definitely stop by and grab a few pierogies .
"overall , this place delivered nicely for me ."
awesome place to watch the game .
"the food is typical bar food , but overpriced ."
get the most expensive tasting menu and brace yourself .
among the best and most knowledgeable staffs anywhere .
it is a destination restaurant in a destination hotel .
"solid , good but nothing special ."
service was excellent and the staff very friendly .
amazing views of the strip ca n't be beat .
the food is solid if not spectacular .
dry sums it up .
"price is right , food is consistently solid ."
the salsa is good .
tried the lamb curry and chicken vindaloo .
basically it has a scottsdale feel in east mesa .
a good place to celebrate .
"corn was incredible , the slaw was ."
got ta try the mole poblano !
paintings for sale from local artists spruce it up .
shut up and keep taking my money .
collard greens are out of bounds .
what a great job they did on my car .
this place is not great during dinner time .
good value for money and a very moving finish .
i would n't expect this from the bellagio .
its faster to do drive through during these hours .
- go after midnight if eating there .
great ambience and great friendly service .
the seating layout is reasonably good .
"all in all , worth seeing ."
ichiban buffet is your basic americanized chinese style buffet .
did not live up to expectations at all .
pretty bad experience imo .
came in for a simple dot physical .
god this place sucks .
you will leave with your side busted out .
skip the pink taco and try this place .
<UNK> when it comes to signing up .
not even then the problem taking care of .
do n't plan on getting your deposit back .
property manager get your head out of your butt .
"the bellhops were an exception , they were great ."
it was a an average experience .
we had both springs done and the bearings replaced .
dean did a great job for us .
door works as good as new .
the worlds # 0 buffet ?
- very deserving title .
the crab legs and shrimp are also delicious .
the whole meal was enjoyable .
absolutely the best ice cream around .
i ' m very hesitant about writing this review .
what ' s the problem ?
this with an active and hungry 0 year old .
the bacon was especially tasty .
our favorite mexican food place here in phoenix .
service is usually excellent .
about 0/0 of the tables were filled .
look through the menu .
they must have been on the ddd show .
i just want someone to bring me some coffee .
so i left without any fanfare .
a very nice environment .
i had ` ` the big breakfast .
no hints of corporate coffee here .
i added in a side of bacon .
i had the bangers and mash .
the wife had the italian .
everything was great served promptly and with a smile .
the food is tasty .
this place is a converted old taco bell .
it ' s a great place for tasty food .
what to eat there ?
they substitute the traditional hamburger with a brat burger .
the omelets are great as well .
normally i get the standard 0 egg breakfast .
make sure to the the tater tots .
these guys really are a bait and switch dealership .
that seems like a great deal .
"first , they wo n't honor the internet price ."
here ' s my advice .
everyone was friendly and we seated promptly .
back to the food .
i had the applewood smoked bacon .
this is a bacon place and you serve this ?
their curry is the bomb !
this spot is legit .
feels like thanksgiving any day of the year .
do not stay st this hotel .
downtown las vegas is really starting to come around .
took a quick little walk though this place .
such a cool use for old ship containers .
big playground in the middle for the kids .
` ` what would you guys like to eat ?
"careful , it catches up to you ."
my wife has sworn off red meat .
at home at least .
still very good though .
i left a voicemail message .
the <UNK> dent removal service is excellent .
self serve coffee was nice as well .
the burger i ordered was really rich and tasty .
how many in your party ?
it ' s literally that easy .
this place looks good but waaaaay overpriced .
food was excellent and tasty .
it was nice looking field with high outfield fences .
. four peaks or san tan ?
my choice would have to be san tan .
i went there today expecting the same old stuff .
what i got was some truely excellent tasting food .
ate here many times but this probably our last .
disappointed for halloween night buffet .
food was not as good as in the past .
sushi not many choice .
chinese roasted pork not crispy skin .
most customers are non vietnamese .
$ 0 per bowl .
"go try it out , guys !"
reaching the leasing office is nothing short of impossible .
the service here is top notch !
the chicken was very juicy and tender .
the crew is great .
the service has been excellent every time .
overall an excellent place .
each pizza was superb .
"great service from moe , the general manager ."
"however , the food was lack luster at best ."
best pizza this side of the hudson river .
i cant afford most of the stuff !
got to watch the us open while shaving !
appetizers i will say were top notch .
waitress rarely stopped and never after meal was delivered .
really bad mexican food .
coming from san diego this food was really bad .
"good price , and very clean ."
the food was nothing better than basic bar food .
i do n't like mexicans making my asian food .
one of the worst experiences of my life .
delicious and highly recommended .
it gets a little muddy after it rains .
i gave up after that .
my wife ordered the <UNK> risotto .
i know what i want and the best dishes .
"go here or order takeout for dinner , please ."
"everything is fresh , consistent and authentic ."
"sadly it is microwaved , not steamed ."
"fast , friendly atmosphere with great bbq ."
bad service sums up the experience .
so no surprise here that is what i ordered .
first the gravy was starchy and lacked flavor .
great toasted sandwiches for about $ 0 .
the selection was incredible !
the actual curry is excellent and authentic .
good appetizer spread during happy hour .
nice patio to have a smoke / drink .
maybe 00 minutes good .
incredibly consistent and very good chinese food !
"in any case , the food here is authentic ."
"ahh , i guess chinese will always be chinese ."
the <UNK> of the production is quite impressive .
this is my new goto spot .
some of the best shows in vegas 0 .
it ' s the bellagio !
this place is really awesome .
very friendly and family oriented place .
the team was courteous and responsive .
highly recommend buying from these guys .
the tri tip was tender and succulent .
too bad the venue is run by amateurs .
the singers and their bands were outstanding .
the lead vocal <UNK> were feeding back .
"perched on the wall , with few people about ."
good luck and enjoy .
"awesome food , good people ."
"great food , handsome waiters and good cocktails ."
both arrived promptly and well made .
even the menus reflect old church programs .
i ultimately go to an eatery to eat .
and that is pretty much exactly what happened .
"ok , atmosphere over , on to the food ."
` ` nacho typical mexican joint !
"fajitas , burritos and tacos ... oh my ."
delicioso - lrb - <UNK> - rrb - .
that ' s a bit outlandish .
but then reyna tends to gouge wherever he can .
the burger was not fresh .
same goes for the fish and chips .
the stew really is very good .
"there was no <UNK> , but plenty of fuel ."
the atmosphere is ... well ... deli counter .
but that ' s what i had to do .
with the emphasis on good .
<UNK> ' s famous fish sandwich .
wholey ' s famous fish sandwich .
roland ' s famous fish sandwich .
"seriously people , you ' re not fooling anyone ."
it was n't a freakin ' hamburger bun !
"i could hear him clearly , every word ."
what ' d she say ?
the direction also lacked peaks and <UNK> .
many of the women suffered from this <UNK> .
it is not a requirement at every performance .
"well , the same applies to primanti brothers ."
do n't buy the hype .
second can be the wait period .
". and frankly , who cares ?"
and without the giant eagle price gouge .
"no doubt either past date , or discontinued ."
two cans ... slightly crushed .
oh ... and the nuisance bar .
"nothing special , but not bad ."
once the burgers came into play - impressive again .
"but , for a bar burger ?"
these are a step above the norm .
one <UNK> six could only hope .
"plump , juicy , and creative sauces ."
theatre factory in <UNK> did it two years ago .
and their productions should be on that exceptional level .
not a big deal .
i ca n't thank 0 guys enough .
the service is still top tier .
"another time , and another place ."
"the reubens were decent , but not ny awesome ."
those were some big thick burgers .
a steak went past for the table behind us .
<UNK> : 0nd visit for the fish sandwich .
this was another <UNK> visit .
and ... ta da !
$ 00 for lunch ?
mad mex is <UNK> tex mex .
soba is <UNK> asian .
want to blow that kind of money ?
a jalapeno to me is not hot .
give them a try .
this is what this space should be used for .
they just wet your appetite and make you hungrier .
that would just about balance things out right .
this really is a fine space .
' that ' s why they created <UNK> .
"chew , rinse and repeat ."
it ' s a buffet .
hokkaido does everything else right .
the same flavorless sausage gravy for dried out biscuits .
sausage greasy enough to lube your 0000 <UNK> .
same ol ' canned fruit .
you may have given the visuals a stunning <UNK> .
the burger was ok .
so that ' s become my spice island staple .
this place deserves diners .
"clean and modern , without being pretentious ."
he also had a very nice singing voice himself .
"the more , the <UNK> ."
just plain ol ' decent bar food .
"some other asian place , closed ."
"park brugge , second mortgage for food anyone ?"
from local faves to far off <UNK> .
something that showed their ` <UNK> ' .
i had honestly passed them by for six months .
what a strange and foreign concept .
sure <UNK> ... tartar sauce ?
the big <UNK> on the was nice .
"all in all , it was a <UNK> visit ."
"well , kind of like a diner cave ."
worth a return trip .
the prices are very reasonable as well .
the little diner that could - and did !
"they have their own creations , and the basics ."
<UNK> was a little bland .
but i suppose my bottom line ... support local .
it was a decent cup of morning <UNK> .
"a little high for breakfast , but manageable ."
even <UNK> is best on any shared plate .
"no huff , no attitude ... true helpfulness ."
i will be back to buy meat .
the <UNK> was excellent for a basic <UNK> .
it ' s being cut right then and there .
"for $ 0.00 , throw in a soft drink ."
"two meat , and two veggie ."
it is what it is .
but it is the cola in peru .
this is n't a mexican restaurant .
not the usual dried out pork .
the atmosphere is a bit strange .
no art to break it up .
just giant walls of brown wood .
and the meal was the most pleasant surprise .
that <UNK> combo was $ 00 .
it ' s a barbecue place .
prices range from $ 0 to $ 0 .
worthy of the price .
coke products ... always a winner in my book .
the grilled marinated chicken was pretty much just that .
chicken with brown stripes on it .
the service was excellent .
prices at <UNK> ' s are average .
this means ... meat .
"first , let ' s cover the selection ."
"from your average steaks , chickens , and pigs ."
"you want it , they ' ve got it ."
you do n't need ten pounds of wings ?
here ' s the trick .
"the earlier in the week , the better ."
"i eat them medium rare , leaning toward rare ."
i tried foster ' s meats in lawrenceville .
las <UNK> in <UNK> .
anderson ' s in the strip .
that ' s what i ' m talking about .
"my personal advice , go early any day ."
a superb stock up shop .
just make sure you use it up quickly .
"go ahead , google it ."
talk about price gouging .
excellent chicken and fair pricing .
"clearly , a win-win situation ."
and the overall atmosphere is just that .
"the food options are plentiful , and quite delicious ."
' mentality of local drivers ?
"frankly , glad we did ."
is it supposed to be a sauce for duck ?
worthy of a big ol ' hug .
we could easily become regulars .
it deserves at least one more .
"then take one half of a medium onion , ."
no big challenge here .
the bacon was downright weird .
it just is n't logical .
"the service was fine , pleasant and helpful ."
"however , the flavor and texture were very good ."
a decent little appetizer .
the food ... bottom line ... was very good .
the rice and vermicelli was adequate .
"it is by far , nothing fancy ."
and he was a big football player type .
the appetizers are good .
this was the good version .
"clearly , a win-win situation ."
and that is exactly what luigi ' s is .
"first , we checked them out on the web ."
"ok , looks a little pretentious ."
but the food ` sounds ' good .
and a waitress with her nose in the air .
"first , the meatloaf ."
"decent meatloaf , but ... meatloaf ."
it was just plain ol ' hamburger bun sized .
"not cider vinegar , but actual apple juice ."
my first time in was pretty successful .
they were out of every fish but tilapia .
then there was a verbal <UNK> between two tables .
the chef has now taken over the business .
"at this rate , it may not ."
the menu is all german .

the smoked meat was extremely tender .
. or should i say ... bon <UNK> .
this place is the epitome of a diner .
terrible equipment and quality .
do n't use cox communications for tv or internet .
well over thirty minutes .
it looked like they might have been understaffed .
needed at least two more servers .

the portion size is four tiny oysters .
i generally enjoyed this place .
i had the <UNK> .
three of them actually .

it ' s a bit on the high side .

<UNK> with a heart and not a .
a county fair inside .

i had one at the outback once .
this is a very tasty little local pizza shop .
the atmosphere is perfect for a ny pizza joint .
food : my mongolian beef was very good .

this bar is terrible in all ways possible .
bar : overcrowded and overpriced .
the layout is not good .
sadly all there is now is golden tee .
now my only issue is the cost of music .
well they did for my <UNK> .
that its my fault .
what ? ! ! now they are the victim .
suddenly they were stored in a climate controlled warehouse .
i would n't believed any great google review .
they can buy those .
run and hit any other tire dealer .
i will sue and call the tv stations .
run for your life .
tires should be fresh within reason .
this franchise owner does n't care about you safety .
"i am out $ 0,000 . 00 ."
total before tip was $ 000 .
i always order a <UNK> steak sandwich .
overall a very disappointing experience .
went on a weeknight for a business diner .
the service was outstanding .
had a small load to move on short notice .
what else should they have done ?
prices are reasonable for a seafood place .
this place is a true gem .
the service is top-notch .
why ca n't 0 be a choice ?
no real frills to speak of .
nice outdoor patio and nice dining area .
"great good , good prices , nice atmosphere ."
food here is excellent .
they also seem to run hot in sections together .
well for a subway it ' s about average .
nothing very impressive or terribly bad .
"yep , in my opinion this place is a-ok ."
no <UNK> nugget stuff .
rooms could definitely use some updating .
both were about what i expected .
the ambiance of the restaurant and decor was nice .
not a bad local gym .
nothing but good things to say about these guys .
so for those reasons i keep coming back .
the prices really ca n't be beat by anyone .
they have worked hard and earned every dime .
this site is built to handle millions of users .
it ' s pretty much a par location .
my favorite is the burrito bowl .
meet all my expectations so far .
but the staff here is kinda slacking .
the cash register is also a bottle neck .
"so food is good , service not so good ."
great price for a great meal .
not to bad for an older theater .
julian serrano ' s latest may be his best .
"unpretentious , modern feel ."
red wine risotto was outstanding .
"wonderful view of the fountains , excellent cocktails ."
"just , all around great times ."
in vegas ! ! perfect tint everytime !
mike and jay pros !
all three broths were very good !
first time trying this place .
five bucks for small bottled water .
this place <UNK> off of poor tourists .
cheaper and better to eat at starbucks .
ps do you see a trend ?
the appetizer literally exploded with flavour in your mouth .
the duck was lost .
maybe do n't order this .
i had a bit of trouble finishing everything .
be prepared for a lineup out the door .
the roast beef is actually really tender and soft .
seriously gigantic in terms of breakfast portions .
go there ... end of story .
the italian pastas and pizza were okay .
the crab legs come in king and snow varieties .
perfect for a good <UNK> experience .
after trying everything i came to one conclusion .
the only good sausage was the pork one .
the <UNK> was n't really made very well either .
i believe they just boiled it and strained it .
she was very nice and gave fantastic service .
they have a lot of nice tvs .
all had a good time .
defiantly well worth the visit .
ordered a couple of breakfast burritos .
the hot sauce was decent and pricing on par .
you wan na have your political opinion ?
that explains why the joint was empty .
they ' re opening a panda express next door !
the ingredients are all fresh as is the dough .
definitely not even close to famous dave ' s .
very cost effective if you order take-out .
i am a prime beef steakhouse lover !
"flemings , mortons , <UNK> , ruth chris ehhh ."
generally a good experience .
dont eat at this place .
they were very good .
the price for what you get is ridiculous .
the location is the highlight of this place .
everything you need is very close by .
the restuarant up top is really good also !
on the to the food .
i ordered the nebraska <UNK> skirt steak hunan style .
the interior could use some updating .
tempura ice cream sounded good .
"in other words , fried ice cream ."
did the sumo bowl look good ?
how long would i need ?
that ' s one <UNK> bowl .
huge thumbs up here .
"not this time , but who knows ."
total came to around $ 00.00 with tax .
fresh vegetables are key to a burger .
"with more animal sauce , of course ."
the panda ca n't handle excess dairy .
"i do hear the shakes are good , though ."
this location inside planet hollywood looks great .
fork and knife would have to do .
great snap from the polish dog .
nacho cheese felt like it came from a container .
my issue is simply the price .
pink ' s was good for the experience .
about 00-00 <UNK> are roasted each night .
adam richman ' s is one of them .
two big dill pickle slices in the burger .
i ' m guessing they used a brioche bun .
very soft and inviting .
fork and knife might be required .
i for one needed a larger mouth .
burgers come with one side item of your choice .
i just sat at the bar for this one .
i saw others at the bar ordering reubens .
also the staff was excellent and very friendly .
"service : competent , reserved ."
the bulgogi was tremendous as is the seafood pancake .
prices raised by 00 % .
tasteful and fun italian themed interior .
a recommendation without a singular reservation .
ambiance : as basic as it gets .
two flat screens play <UNK> <UNK> music videos .
the dosas are to be highly recommended .
the portions are tremendous .
one of montreal ' s hidden treasures .
hear is where it gets worse .
how many people even fit in that club .
james was very helpful and friendly .
"the mattress , and power base are fantastic ."
you will be glad you did .
the area is kept clean and well maintained .
"fantastic crepes , friendly place ."
classic <UNK> that will be out of business soon .
this place is so damn good .
the interior design of the place is genius .
how does that make sense ?
i ' ll give the young guy an exception .
thanks for asking and insulting my intelligence .
churn continues to impress .
i love the old school vibes this place oozes .
"if you have n't been , i recommend ."
i was swearing off cafe rio .
all these locals were stoked about new mexican food .
"whatever , cafe rio !"
worst establishment i have ever been to .
first off the service was very poor .
slowest service on earth .
really solid thai food .
i will not eat here again .
i also got a coke .
coke goes well with some foods .
"empanadas , for example , and most chinese food ."
it was almost impossible .
it was like this at <UNK> <UNK> .
i had $ 0 in my pocket .
there ' s really nothing here .
the hostel : my room was good .
but that ' s their fault .
this place is popular .
but give it a try .
i know they have burgers on the menu .
cornbread was off the hook .
one of the nicest rooms i have stayed in .
good food and fantastic service .
i am not even canadian and i love poutine .
my wife and i order some dogs and poutine .
this is where is starts to go down hill .

00 hour bagel spot spitting out thousands a day .
the place is basically a factory .
you see the bagels rolling out as you order .
one of the worst places in vegas !
the ambiance and service were spectacular .
"amazing cheese selection , phenomenal beers , great service !"
even then it was not the bagel i ordered .
manager really needs help .
our food was very good .
the portions were generous .
the wait is unbelievable long and not worth it .
i went here with my wife and family .
if i could give it zero stars i would .
grade : a + .

did n't pull the floor mats and <UNK> underneath .
our child has done well in the 0s class .
wo n't go this place ever .
i had better at cheap buffets .
"lastly , if you can save room for deserts ."
you will know what i mean .

the soup was spectacular despite it being extra spicy .

that was the highlight of the experience .
the ground beef and carne asada were ok .
chips and salsa were slightly above average .
the young lady behind the counter was very courteous .
both beers fell far short in my opinion .
both beers tasted really watered down .
no real distinct flavor and no hop character .
ipas like these are a dime a dozen .
the stout had no body .
solid beer selection as well .
i give this place a high three .
fresh and on draft is a different story .
tony is one of the best bartenders in pittsburgh .
great and numerous selection of beers .
it must be me .
single cut vs whole pie .
one negative was that i only got three bones .
the greens were delicious ... top notch .
the baked beans were also solid .

i stopped by here before the steeler playoff game .
the interior has a good look .
i got the <UNK> for desert .
did it live up to the hype ?
the beer list was disappointing .
it seems that it is getting exponentially worse .
i got the steak frites .
it just seemed ordinary to me .
if you like bourbon this is a must try .
the <UNK> is unique in a good way .
it ' s the atmosphere that gets you .
i probably like this place more than others .
the steak will surprise you .
it is better than most .
oh and by the way my steak was outstanding .
was it the best pizza in the city ?
the ambiance is great compared to other chinese restaurants .
"it was a solid meal , but definitely overpriced ."

i got one rib taco and two brisket tacos .
good variety of beer as well .

very solid beer selection .
<UNK> is my favorite brewery in pittsburgh .
i then got the bone in strip steak .
the owner is the nicest guy in the world .
three stars worth of heat was good for us .
this place has really fallen from grace .
simple ayce eatery located inside the fremont hotel .
food is a basic buffet with an okay selection .
. great for the price but nothing too fancy .
tables were plentiful and very clean .
hawaiian style plate lunches around 0 to 0 bucks .
i had the 0 choice meal with chow mein .
there are better deals and food within walking distance .
. find a meal worth your time .
he was honest friendly and professional .
kaizen charges triple for what they call sushi .
had the $ 00 burger .
"if you want to be upscale , be upscale ."
mixing and matching the two is just <UNK> .
not nearly flavorful enough .
i then ordered penne with hot sausage fra diavolo .
the food was excellent .
my wife had the porky ' s nightmare .
when i asked ` ` what is late ?
"each dish was well balanced , distinct and rich ."
great place if you have a really huge appetite .
wait service was very good .
our pool server was very good as well .
i made the reservation via yelp / open table .
vegas never ceases to amaze with stupid human behavior .
watch the bellagio water show on the patio too .
perfect for cooling off in the vegas heat .
to my amazement i was wrong .
there was a special of haddock parmesan .
this places <UNK> your hunger .
whats not to like ?
i really should give this place a zero .
"never go here , it ' s bad ."
ah the marquee how i do enjoy this venue !
it takes 0 seconds .
what makes or breaks this place is the sound .
the inside is nothing special .
what can i say about <UNK> ?
so with that being said here i go .
i have never had a bad time here .
"the burgers were nothing special , heh ."
my first impression of <UNK> ' s was superb .
a very <UNK> and intimate setting .
this was incredibly good .
feel free to disagree with me on that .
just go here and get the italian sub .
overall this is a nice facility .
you begin with an immaculate salad bar .
that is always a positive .
the bar in itself is really cool .
for the price it cant be beat .
all stuff chicago sports .
this place blows so much .
all i could say was ` ` wow !
a pretty expansive menu for this type of place .
a lot of sides are offered as well .
overall i had a good experience .
what else can i say ?
fnb did a showcase of a cheese sampler .
fnb has a open kitchen .
the complete opposite is done here .
totally cool i felt .
the charm of this place was also appealing .
"the house pulled mozzarella , and the lamb <UNK> ."
i could not complain about any of those things .
i ordered the lamb koobideh .
nothing about this place reflects a bakery .
would i wait in line for 00 minutes again ?
more on that later .
the actual building itself was pretty cool .
what kills this place is the crowd .
honestly i do n't know why people praise somethings .
and roasted peppers with goat cheese .
that place will knock your socks off .
that has nothing to do with baseball .
maybe for lunch instead of dinner though .
then the pizza ... oh man was it good .
a 00 inch thin crust pizza .
the dough was great .
the sauce was definitely solid .
the cheese placement was spot on .
all around a damn good pizza .
the <UNK> of crust was completely <UNK> .
such an awkward experience at this place .
i will totally overlook this place in the future .
the same deal was with the rice .
but i will say this .
such a better experience than sitting at the tables .
cheers to you josh .
a very limited menu offering but solid food .
blowing us away with outstanding food .
so i trusted his opinion .
a great way to begin the meal .
so next time i will just get the sandwich .
"the typical shitty , scottsdale night club ."
somehow having numerous rooms is impressive to people .
but each room is full of douchebags .
the pizza and the cheese calzone .
definitely a solid pizza and an awesome calzone .
this was a typical fair .
it ' s full of douche bags .
iron chef jose <UNK> restaurant in scottsdale ?
damn good salsa and solid chips .
now it ' s time for the main courses .
0 courses $ 00 bucks for cuisine like this ?
the pizza was excellent .
the oven roasted vegetables were excellent .
i ' d go other places .
this place is terrible .
what i do n't get is the dj .
that is n't so at <UNK> .
that can not be overlooked by <UNK> .
only the best of the best work in boston .
you can see how clean the kitchen is .
the chicken wings are actually pretty good .
the calamari is a breaded frozen product .
the hamachi lived up to its reputation !
the sushi was standard issue .
also they have two lists of special appetizers .
overall quality was pretty damn good .
not a bad deal at all imo .
it came in a huge piping hot bowl .
this is a solid meal at a good value .
"succulent meat in a light steamed bun , hmmmm ."
"wow , just wow ."
"same concept , but with much higher quality ingredients ."
i will put it this way .
"ok , i ' m just like everyone ."
so far this place is looking pretty good .
the dolmas were pretty good as well .
the value of this place is solid .
i had the bison burger .
very slow service with mediocre food .
people will pay no matter what .
it ' s a sports bar with bar food .
great quality toppings on quality bread .
it is the <UNK> sandwich .
i had lunch here last week .
the $ 0.00 lunch special .
do n't be thrown off by the building itself .
i had the classic gyro .
sky harbor is 0 minutes away 0 .
downtown phoenix is 00 minutes away 0 .
old town scottsdale is 00 minutes away .
arcadia is 0 minutes away .
biltmore is 00 minutes away .
washer and dryer in each unit .
there is not ample parking for tenants / guests .
the staff can be very pretentious 0 .
a lot of riff raff ' s live here .
attractive food and an all around great time .
hey another typical scottsdale night spot .
full of douche bags and hot chicks .
i could have ate about eight of these things .
then came the pho .
they pack this place in .
this place is ok .
overall i was pretty impressed .
a nice and modern hotel .
terrific food and great atmosphere .
i do n't normally stray far from pepperoni pizza .
garlic fries are the bomb !

this is the best ice cream on earth .
i tried the buckeye .
"a worthy classic , says the aficionado ."

bring some mrs . dash .
the front of house staff was relaxed .
the water was pretty good though .
maybe i just ate the box ?
"the pastries and donuts look really good , too ."

its a great pizza .
the drive pulled out going the wrong way .

very classy decor and well dressed patrons .

ive had multiple dishes and all are very tasty .
this place is legit .
first off - - great chicken fried steak .
made on premises which is a rare thing indeed .
most places use the frozen ready to cook version .
- rrb - ... but very close .
the gravy was also excellent .
waiter was a good guy and attentive enough .
which brings me to a strange moment .
` ` the prices listed were wrong ' ' .
laziness on the part of the managers and staff ?
intentional hiding of the higher priced <UNK> product ?
00 + minutes on hold .
its a 00 minute drive .
gave lock make and code # .
refused to give refund .
next day comes and son calls .
this unethical charge was never approved or authorized .
' ' no one would ever ask that .
i was blown away .
i have to fill this out ?
and of course its always someone elses fault .
great great pizza at a fair price !
love their version of baked ziti .
wonderful pleasant hostesses and terrific service staff .

the rooms were old and outdated .
it is a pretty good <UNK> restaurant .
the rooms are big and clean .

0 spiced duck sliders : two small bao .
the service : no problems .
food arrived in an appropriate amount of time .
ramen : several varieties .
most are familiar to <UNK> .
the red ramen is just angry spicy .

probably a match made in heaven for some people .
i have no problems with it .
usually ~ 00-00 cents cheaper per gallon versus retail .
lucky burger : this is their standard burger .
the <UNK> is what makes all the difference .
tamago burger : this is an interesting burger .
this is definitely one of their heavier burgers .
buta burger : this burger is for the <UNK> .

"no complaints , good fresh quality ."
probably the best one i ' ve ever had .
"him : so , what brings you to phoenix ?"

so i assumed i had three good tires .

good place to come after work .

they wo n't stop .
happy with the selection of wines and craft beers .

this place almost has it right .
the chicken kabob flavor is decent .
the pita was cold as well .

this place is awesome !
"great & courteous personnel , awesome chiropractor !"
i ' m from l . a . .

then the cabbage and pork came out .
i can watch tv at home .
"beer great , oktoberfest ."

not bad not great .
waitress <UNK> out the wrong meal for my partner .
the dish served was $ 00 .
seems to be a real problem with this server .
i had the flauta special .

all four times i sat at the bar .
i drank the ipa .
i was excited about having another brewpub nearby .
once again the beer and food were good .

service : below average .
food : diner food .
that pretty much sums it up .

ai n't nobody coming back a second time .

pretty cool view from the top .
beer in a boot excellent .
"food was above average , but a little pricey ."
was passing through and stopped here for the night .

"could be better , could be worse ."
the facility is very clean and rather high end .

for lunch i have 0 go-to ' s .

all the staff and management are great .
thanks to all you guys for making life easy .
there was a large roach on the floor .
they have decent pizza and wings .
randomly found fuku burger walking down the strip .
hands down the best burger i have ever had .
it ' s off the chain .
just off the strip in chinatown .
the top of his list was other mama <UNK> .
the incompetence and lack of professionalism was astounding !
becoming a tradition when passing through vegas .
probably just as well given how much we ate .
they seem very nice .
"pancakes , ok but not up to the hype ."
unhappy employees do n't make good care providers .
definitely worth a repeat visit .
` ` as good as it gets ?
fantastic pizza and friendly service .
did i mention they were also expensive ?
"this time , i decided to do some research ."
beware that jets fly nearly non-stop almost overhead .
fairly inexpensive for a fine french restaurant .
pretentious staff and clientele .
the patio is decent sized but narrow .
this place is an absolute gem .
- rrb - with a few tables outside .
the best part is the food .

- - states to present within 00 days .
but it ' s a counter service joint .
they sell goat meat in their frozen meats .
a cornish game hen costs about $ 0.00 .
and it ' s remarkably good sourdough .
more power to winco !
"turned around , went back to the store ."
' ' i had forgotten that part .
"service sucked though , unfortunately ."
philly cheese steak was also very delicious .
the coffee is standard caribou fare .
maybe a board game or two ?
they were cold and awful .
the menu is centered around kebabs and indian food .
i had the lamb makhani which was fantastic .
i tasted two kebabs .
oh yea watch out for beggars everywhere
the service is even more hit-or-miss than the food .
i ' ve since returned to satisfactory experiences .
there are two <UNK> mounted for your enjoyment .
this is the place to be .
"in general , i really like boulders on broadway ."
it gets surprisingly packed and the staff becomes overwhelmed .
these guys know what they ' re doing !
these are must-see rides .
"it ' s not all roses , mind you ."
that ' s four generations now .
she ' s a keeper !
the food is typically very good .
how does an irish bar eliminate guinness .
"who cares , it ' s just five dollars ?"
"get rid of coupons , and raise prices ?"
this employee has quit now .
this place is a local gem .
this just replaced any pizzeria in <UNK> .
might be the best mexican food i ever had .

"but no worries , your seat is reserved ."
we truly feel <UNK> by this place .
will not come near or rent from here again .
call to confirm the price on your reservation .

only warning is the place is extra loud .
the <UNK> was good with a few flaws imo .
business lunch with clients on a tight schedule .
slow service ... decent food .
0nd time we experienced slow service at lunch .
the willow house has lots of <UNK> potential .

locally owned and well run .
good job ! ! ! simply the best burger .
"the shakes are tops also ! ! fries , eh"
this place is great .

- sweet potato fries are a winner .
- checked in on yelp for a free drink .
. a nice place to stop for lunch .

when the food came it was cold .

her special sauce makes her grilled food really tasty .
i grew up in charlotte .
dont buy anything here .
this place will rip you off .
it so is n't that bad .
the prices were fair and the coffee was awesome .
chinese food should be bomb .
not here need i say much .
the tacos are absolutely worth it .
the chips were in house made chips for sure .
the sahara location is my go to .
it has all the parts just not the flavor .
but that did n't score me anything lol .
they do everything perfect .
i thought they were a better establishment then that .
like $ 00 a burger high .
awesome little joint down town .
cool food deserves a cool packaging !
they offer indoor and outdoor dining .
anyhow back to the food .
except for the <UNK> .
but for what it was it was very good .
so there ' s no shortage of seating .
here at buldogis you wo n't go hungry .
what are you waiting for ?
- and then there is their cucumber chiller drink .
ice cream itself was ok but nothing exciting .
i might check out the other location to compare .
not gourmet food but good food for a buffet .

the food and drinks are always good as expected .
all this and bread and butter as well .
yes one stinking onion ring weird i know .
this place is just like that .
i burgers itself was a little cold .
awesome little ice-cream sandwich place in downtown summerlin .
whenever you think four seasons you think quality right ?
the resturant itself is very cool nice and huge .
extremely high ceilings and great atmosphere .
holy moly am i one happy customer .
the best park it the honey mustard bbq sauce .
well i was wrong .
so if you want to try it try it .
are you a health buff ?
consistent and just as cool .
pretty good and pretty spicy .
it might just have been an off night .
will probably come back here again .
perhaps the general should consider learning from his <UNK> .
from this point on he has an attitude .
we are leaving edc and traffic is ridiculous .
i speak spanish an it was a personal call .
these guys did a great job painting my bike .
their home made bbq sauce is outstanding !
great food and service .

d ' s is named perfectly .
their mint chocolate chip is very good as well .
their vegetarian appetizer platter is fantastic .
the grilled meats were served on top of rice .
"overall though , this is a great restaurant ."

the view of the city is fantastic .
the sight lines of the field are great .
they have a huge list of beers on tap !

my wife and i dined here for lunch .
i can normally handle some spice .
this had several whole <UNK> peppers on it .
this completely overpowered the sandwich and my taste buds .
my wife had a mahi sandwich and loved it .
it easily could be a meal for two .
the burgers are huge and flavorful .
i had the barbecue bacon burger which was fantastic .
"drinks are pricey here , beware ."
it is full of charm and history .
all were very tasty .
"very upscale , very tasty ."
food in the restaurant is poor .
way better than your average urgent care .
i found a cock roach in my food .
completely innovative materials and textures abound .
first let me say the bagels were very good .
good green chile pork .
and amazingly poor service .
easily the best sushi in town .
great attention to detail and excellent service .
great vibe with too many great choices .
i had the <UNK> and would highly recommend it .
very rich and savory grain dish with poached egg .
great baked goods as well .
excellent quality and value .
good but not great ramen .
just had a great meal here .
every dish was excellent .
a very interesting menu the is executed flawlessly .
a brand new iphone in 00 minutes !
"in fact , nothing happened ."
i was told a manager would call me back .
service was dismal both trips .
many thanks to alicia for the recommendation .
what ' s a fortune cookie without a fortune ?
"just a damn cookie , that ' s what ."
that ' s f ' d up .
thinking about going to uno ' s ?
"some really , really slow service ."
pile everything in a blender .
press ` puree ' .
"this is n't south mountain , people ."
this is n't a damn nature hike .
this is camelback f ` in mountain .
"both trails rock , but i prefer echo ."
definitely worth checking out .
because it is fun .
"enough to fill you up , fo ' <UNK> !"
"yeah , that ' s a <UNK> thing ."
tons of cool guests .
who can argue with that ?
"good , but not great ."
they even sell record players .
nobody said anything if it was n't .
"very tasty , and a nice change of pace ."
"service was fine - quite attentive , actually ."
"oh yeah , we ' ll be back ."
take all you want .
but it was 0 o'clock .
and there was a suns game .
another 00 minutes around the block .
"fucking shit , man ."
why is there no 0th street ?
what the fuck happened to 0th street ?
who built this fucking city ?
find them and fucking burn them .
are you paying attention ?
sorry for all the <UNK> .
that ' s street cred in my book .
so i ordered the seafood pizza .
what does that mean ?
- rrb - was actually dripping off the plate .
so i went back to la bocca .
because this time was better .
up from two stars to three .
weird thing was we were the only ones there .
that ca n't be good .
and we apparently <UNK> ordered 0 of them .
"me , i dig it ."
"no , apparently not , according to my date ."
teach them well and let them lead the way .
leave me alone - i ' m working .
"ok , just yelping ."
i ' m at work .
i ' ve got a meeting in ten minutes .
"no , i ca n't reschedule ."
i dig this place .
"ask for more , they ' ll bring it ."
margarita ordering tip : go for broke .
the base margarita blows .
"` ` wait , ' ' he said ."
one of the mechanics came in .
"he called the guy , the guy came over ."
customer : did you rotate the tires ?
do you want them rotated ?
customer : they ' re pulling my car out .
clerk : do you still want the tires rotated ?
' ' clerk : ` ` how much ?
my new favorite mexican place in tempe .
i usually go with one <UNK> and one pescado .
the doctors are extremely knowledgable .
"best used media store in town , hands down ."
how cool is that ?
drop it off on the counter on your left .
service was friendly and efficient both trips .
"it was cheap , and cheap is good ."
thank you southwest lady !
"bad food , worse service ."
but start with it i did .
i ' ve been coming here for years .
"this place is gone , man ."
apparently incorporated into <UNK> chrysler jeep out in mesa .
that ' s just the way it is there .
i think it helps knowing that going in .
but i <UNK> on the pimento cheese sandwich .
and she ' ll eat anything .
and they ' re probably right .
should ' ve just come here first .
so we were looking for something different in tempe .
one star reviews are rare for me .
` ` i ca n't talk right now .
i ' ll call you back .
mmmm ... cardboard parmesan .
"bad service , bad food ."
". well , <UNK> ' s ."
not part of my typical <UNK> .
did i use it correctly ?
"yeah , i know ."
it ' s burger king .
it ' s a chain .
i just got this effin arrowhead looking thing .
other sunday specials include eggs benedict and eggs albuquerque .
0 stars for what it is - cheap pizza .
and cheap pizza is good pizza .
super cool little open air patio .
"that ' s the real question , right ?"
they ' ve got customer friendly policies .
spent the afternoon here with my little bro .
the spice factor seems a little inconsistent .
"yeah , i suck ."
but i suppose i should mention the bowling alley .
crappy video game selection .
"crappy food , bad service and a dirty restaurant ."
that ' s the real question .
and the answer is hells yeah .
"you snooze , you lose , pal ."
even bad pizza is good pizza .
it ' s cheap chinese .
thanks for the extra miles .
but that ' s another review .
"you sized me up quick though , did <UNK> ?"
how i miss the good old days .
"decent food , but bad service ."
it was my fault .
tasty but smaller portions .
"polenta with a five mushroom ragu , unbelievable ."
"their signature spaghetti , out of this world ."
the appointment was at 00:00 .
not even in the second waiting area yet .
i am now searching for a new doctor .
wo n't be better from any other one .
avoid this place for sure .
how disgusting but par for the area .
the rv park personnel seem very nice and helpful .
made reservations and arrived 0 minutes early .
that alone earned the 0 stars .
"keep up the good work , guys !"
i definitely prefer to support the locally based economy .
the food is awesome .
another great spot in the hood .
great salad there today for my 0st trip .
the sushi here was great .
the big treat was the cigar bar upstairs .
"fresh , clean , great tasting food ."
medium for the chef was more like medium rare .
i know i did n't hit the break .
solid 0 maybe a bit higher .
$ 000 cash only for a five mile tow .
so many good beers .
quick service at a fair price .
it came out with one patty .
we both thought it was fantastic and highly recommend .
this is a review i tried not to write .
flash <UNK> to november 00st 0000 .
the name should be changed from seamus to <UNK> .

ok 0 + 0 is like 00 that equation .
and be able to answer very simple questions .
this is why you establishment sucks .
this place is terrible .
this is what downtown has been missing .
this place is just plain good .
and then to wash it down with two <UNK> .
no clue what people are talking about .
this place is awesome .
my only critique was noise in the restaurant .
that is the general manager justin .
this man <UNK> tequila to say the least .
his knowledge of the product is out standing .
this is all thanks to the gm justin .
its incredible what he does for this place .
taco guild has a customer for life in me .
you will not be disappointed .
next time i ' ll hit up five guys .
this place just rocks .
all thanks to <UNK> with the on point recommendations .
you simply must go and go again .
looking around the dining room you see junk everywhere .
the place is just dirty .
i have experienced bugs at your location twice .
"great night , good crowd , good times ."
two girls who looked like i was bothering them .
i will not be going back to this establishment .

the positives for planet hollywood .
the room was large and well appointed .
"gives me <UNK> , absolutely incredible ."
highly recommend professional all the way .
thin new york style .
moist and tender with a great crispy batter .
the cheddar mashed potatoes were awesome .
she did n't really care no discount or anything .
aside from that the biscuits and gravy were decent .

you only get 0 first impression .
i had one of their specials of the evening .
spicy duck - 0 / 0 iv .
fernando was a great guide .
i now get all donuts here .

high school cafeteria on steroids .
this place is garbage .
wrong - this place should come with a warning .
food to be taken at your own risk .
bean burro enchilada <UNK> .
chicken tacos with jalapeno cream cheese - wow .
"the people , the service are outstanding ."

i ' ll spend my money on line .
you wo n't be disappointed .
simply the best tacos i ' ve ever had .
ca n't say enough good things about this place .
"average <UNK> food , on the bland side ."
so what exactly am i talking about ?
flimsy plastic silverware that was just about unusable .
the pad thai is amazing .
came here for a business lunch .
most always 0 star .
i ' ve been here dozens of times .
the food was good and the service was average .

the ambiance is best for college / late twenties .
they also have a reading selection .
great place for a quick grab or relax .
"always comes out good , little variation ."
i highly recommend <UNK> .
turns out i should have held out for elsewhere .
"every special requests tended to , sizeable portions ."
all the reviews here are true .
one star for a food you never even tried ?
even rainbow is head and shoulders above this place .
this is not how business should ever be done .
my other reviews of other establishments are very positive .
fried pickles were awesome .
will this gym ultimately be a five star experience ?
all i can say is wow .
"next , the foie gras poutine ."
the most iconic dish of montreal .
"delicious also , they brew their own beer"
their chips are also great .
then i called todd back to make an appointment .
it is a fine line between <UNK> and resistance .
they have seemed to master this quite well .
thankfully the meal was pretty cheap .
purchased the unlimited pass .
"a good experience , overall ."
"would i dine there , again ?"
waited over 00 minutes from ordering to receive entree .
server apologized a number of times .
always a good time .
same with the pasta dishes .
this is one thing phoenix has done right .
the heard museum is truly awesome .
the place also feels rather cold .
i am not usually a fan of botanical gardens .
this place never grows old .
this family-run restaurant is very simple but friendly .
those seem particularly well stocked .
i ' ve had mixed results with the staff .
some have been very nice and helpful .
gold bar was a great find .
"i mean , this humus had complex flavor notes !"
"that aside , kudos all around ."
but the pho is great .

both brothers are really professional and courteous .
happy hour is pretty solid !

"try the hummus with eggplant , dynamite ."
we had the chicken kabobs which were pretty good .

i thought the pizza was a little subpar .
major upgrade from <UNK> ' s .
this review needs few words .

breakfast you can not go wrong with any omelette .
"understandable , they told me in advance ."
the pizza is not that great .
no hovering service but great attentiveness .
"have the drunk bread with prosciutto , phenomenal ."
their sushi is better than most in the valley .

their asian kale salad and kale wrap are delicious .
friendly and helpful staff .
install the os on it .
what do you mean ?
good crowd even during the week .
the suite and rooms where great .
nice beds and good decor .
now today we <UNK> the order was never placed .
the service from his office is terrible .
so the place is pretty cool .
not sure if you will receive the same treatment .
"great cocktails , amazing <UNK> italian eats ."
. even then it ' s hit and miss .
<UNK> at hertz is the best .
the whole thing looks like a scam .
"excellent , excellent place ."
his staff however was not .
they want another office visit and more money .
delicious and amazing quantity for the prove you pay .
the streaks all i can say is wow .
this place was horrid .
however the free wi fi never worked .
i went into labor at 0am march 0nd .
zero stars ! ! this place is a waste .
the urgent care was a waste of time .
steaks and frites are awesome .
"vegas , orlando , and atlanta ."
what a great environment .
could n't get a refill on my soda .
not bad pizza but not the best .
this is a 0.0 star review .
"great poutine , good duck , great halibut ."
both were very tasty .
service can vary but was very good this time .
was full at 0:00 pm on a thursday .
"limited selection and condescending , immature salesperson ."
"the menu seemed korean , rather than <UNK> ."
service was prompt and friendly .
a 0 - star might have been too much .
food was good but service was terrible .
now the good part .
the burgers here are pretty good .
the price is decent for what you get .
blueberry hill is a good place for breakfast .
ordered a philly cheese steak with a meal .
"lemonade was not lemonade , just water ."

i wish i lived near a place like this .
i wandered around checking the place out .
it ' s a <UNK> .
its deep within the <UNK> of mandalay bay .
i had the sliders they were very good .
really nice lunch special that will leave you full !
easy parking and great prices .
also a very large desert menu .
kudos to sean and his staff .
i ordered the breakfast ` ` special ' ' .
"one cup of java , and one large oj ."
portion size for price was great .
the creativity and execution of each dish was fantastic .
great interior with an upscale but still casual vibe .
"as well , the lobster ravioli was pretty decadent ."
level 0 on the heat scale .
this place is terrible .
the food is average .
room sizes are decent and have good modern furniture .
like any <UNK> wants to buy a busted tv .
this store is nothing more than a con operation .
"thieves , thieves , thieves all ."
"i ordered a beer , and waited ."
jose was excellent and most professional .
i enjoyed everything that i ate from the buffet .
i had fried fish basket and it was great .
however after that this dealership is a huge failure .
which was more than fair .
seriously folks avoid this place like the plague .
"if you like mexican food , eat here ."
one of the worst dining experience i can recall .
had to come out of a microwave .
i ' ve known thomas for 00 years .
service was really good and always offered refills .
"great place , great service ."
<UNK> <UNK> made the process as painless as possible .
i would certainly recommend this dealership .
day two was great .
$ 00 for all day access .
prices for everything were excessive .
more like low quality cafeteria .
went there for a sunday brunch .
"fyi , flatbreads are only $ 0 sunday afternoons ."
the food came rather quickly .
had to ask for syrup as well as silverware .
specialty is <UNK> style meats .
"try the sauces , they compliment the meats ."
that was a mistake .
have to hand it to the two waiters .
menu was limited but interesting .
had the pork chop .
i was really proud of my problem solving skills .
prices where reasonable and product is outstanding .
good selection of vape products and <UNK> .
did n't vacuum between the seats .
way beyond the norm .
"timely , excellent execution and helpful advice ."
i feel secured when i cash in my pocket .
wow worst customer service ever .
the mango lassi and paratha were both top notch .
my wife and i love this little place .
delivery is available within a 0 mi .
wont return in the near future .
so i know they might have forgot my order .
good food ; mexican ambiance .
one of the best dive bars in phoenix .
fun people who visit this place .
best breakfast for the buck .
<UNK> breakfast and beer .
mobile 0 is the best oil .
food portion is very good and very reasonable price .
have a beer or two or few .
they hit it out of the park everytime .
long time pho eater .
one of the the best vietnamese joints ever .
highly recommend this place .
overall i love the place and keep going back .
the carne asada burrito is awesome !
excellent milkshakes and quirky location .
the black forest cake is very good and moist .
0 star recommendation with no reservations .
as for the food ?
first impressions of the resort were overall very positive !
the room presented reasonably well .
not cheap but not expensive either .
the casino is small .
the location is good .
the oysters were essentially raw and coated in spices .
a short time later the entrees were delivered .
a feather and branches .
the chips and salsa are good .
the lunch menu is consistently good .
and the dinner menu is enormous .
- the salt and pepper beef is very good .
time to make a china chili run !
i understand a rush .
"a bagel , orange juice , and a banana ."
all very good service points .
the crew they sent was great .
i got a chicago dog at this place .
breakfast buffet in the morning was perfect .
i ordered a burger with onion rings .
it was the perfect onion rings .
got one more 00oz beer and i was satisfy .
wow ... what a place .
a nice little selection of local beers as well .
no complaints about the food or drink from me .
service was spotty despite not being too busy .
another one of those famous for being famous places .
stay away from this place in lv .
great value for the money .
go to hell denny ' s .
best fucking park in baseball .
more than just tanning services ie .
00 - rrb - no hidden costs .
00 - rrb - going out of town ?
let them sink slow .
if you go i hope you come out <UNK> .
"you pick the meat , they make the sandwich ."
"severed fast and friendly , but be careful ."
"that was awesome , and the food was amazing ."
"but that ' s fine , i understand ."
the sauce is still awesome .
could that improve the quality ?
and thats what brings me back .
too many other great options in vegas .
location is close to everything .
so that ' s really a con .
ask for a room by the elevator .
best of luck to the new owners .
have a great beer selection .
and a new club .
everything has a new mexican spin on american classics .
the burger was mediocre at best .
tv ' s with sports everywhere .
i had the same experience in glendale .
buffalo wild wings is terrible .
the rice and beans are very authentic .
i usually get one of the mouth watering omelets .
the interior is fairly big .
pretty good for a buffet place .
"admittedly , i tend to avoid buffet places ."
"way off the strip , at the m casino ."
"deserts are awesome , especially gelato and creme brulee ."
always a safe bet for breakfast & brunch .
i would recommend the suicide flavoured wings .
now to the food .
all around great dining experience .
a + for food quality and service .
the breakfast buffet is a pretty good deal too .
which happens usually around august of every year .
"eat drink , and gamble ."
i also had the roast pork sandwich .
"service good , food variety good , quality bad !"
"i <UNK> the manager on duty , !"
"horrible company , bill was over 0x the estimate ."
"great food , clean , fast and amazing prices ."
very friendly family owned place .
our water had a live cricket in it .
definitely avoid this place .
they charge extra for salsa .
do not be fooled by the 0.0 stars .
they offer free desert for a good yelp review .
the food was 0.0 stars at best .
they meat was not cut appropriately .
the seasoning was meh as well .
ordered online at 00:00 pm .
my wife was charged $ 000.00 for 0 nights .
it took 00 minutes just to check-in .
"a few months ago , a technician came by ."
i believe the technician is from russia or <UNK> .
both had a sandwich and some chilli .
the food was acceptable .
as with other posts service was a little slow .
the place needs a good cleaning .
moved close by recently .
seems over priced for what we had .
there are significantly better places .
i trust them and so does my wife .
they told me i needed to order new parts .
my bike has never ridden as smooth as now .
it ' s not the cleanest place either .
this is a great local shop .
it has a great local feel .
"friendly staff , clean , and great tasting food ."
the owner ruined it though .
"that said , these are my issues ."
"wow , that response was inspiring ."
really confused here ... ?
it feels like you are in rocky point .
if been eating there since the mid ' 00s .
my only option for internet is wireless .
this place is really cool .
the food is awesome .
order this exactly and you will not be disappointed .
new castle and surf music .
then its a big line .
great atmosphere and service .
i ' ve been there a couple times .
serving only ontario microbrew beer is a big plus .
the staff was pretty good overall .
went at supper time during the week .
cool new place in fitchburg .
go for beers but eat somewhere else .
now i ' m good .
how can this place be anything less then 0 .
one if three different sizes .
"that ' s all you need , trust me ."
in from nyc and stopped by with my wife .
would go back again in a heartbeat .
vietnamese owner who lived in lao for sometime .
<UNK> gai and <UNK> <UNK> gai were top notch .
easily stop if in madison .
best bet : turkish coffee and the <UNK> skillet .
everything we had was great .
"the headliner , chris porter , was particularly good ."
there is n't much else to say .
big with lots of fish and and excellent dressing .
and the beef skewer was fantastic .
friendly and helpful staff .
and the golden door spa is world class .
not enjoyable to say the least .
the people there are great .
heard much about michael mina .
i must say the <UNK> was fantastic .
appetizer octopus and smelt fries were tasty and <UNK> .
do not trust this days in .
they take your money .
i asked for non smoking .
went back and changed and got another smokers room .
they stole my money .
the room is not worth 00 bucks .
it ' s not worth 00 bucks .
do n't waste your time or money .
if they do n't let you see .
why would they say 00 mins lose refund .
do n't trust this pace .
i can bet this place does .
go to better places .
food is very good and service is excellent .
full of ambiance and charm .
you wo n't be disappointed .
the food is cheap and very healthy .
the congee is just $ 0 and filing .
i have been there a number if times .
the place is enormous .
this hotel is what it is .
chief among them ... its affordable .
does it have good shows to go see ?
pleasantly surprised to say the least .
of course the food is tastey .
we had 0pm reservations and thank god we did .
by 0:00 pm the place was just about full .
this guy is not that type of service tech .
pricing was reasonable and expected .
surely i would use him again and again .
the waiter surely knew the menu inside and out .
typical chain restaurant environment .
literally was on the table five minutes after ordering .
should have gone to buca .
gary runs the place like a ny style joint .
diana manages the place and she is fantastic !
not the cheapest place in the world .
but with way nice people to greet you .
the red <UNK> sauce was fantastic .
this is your place .
but a lot of the illusions are older ones .
but that block is long in 000 degree heat .
and one block behind the strip is noticeably <UNK> .
they <UNK> through our fingers rapidly .
this is of the best bargains in las vegas .
"all pretty good , completely satisfying ."
a great night all around .
"so take it from me , this place sucks ."
"me - - white , wife - - red ."
"the wine was n't that good , btw ."
"admittedly , the wife really liked her eggplant parmesan ."
but i almost immediately started feeling sick .
there must be better opportunities .
the tortillas were great .
the service was prompt and courteous .
"check , check and check ."
very good sandwiches made here .
have not tried the other sandwiches .
interesting spot for a sandwich shop .
it ' s kind of hidden away .
the subway is nestled near other establishments .
no way you can mess this appetizer up .
they must have over cooked the noodles .
the place was not busy at all .
"finally , waitress sat us down ."
it is american style thai restaurant .
what thai restaurant has sushi thrown into the menu .
drop me a line .
another couple minutes before anyone took my order .
"great steak , potatoes and homemade blue cheese dressing ."
i had them do the deep clean service .
the result was perfect .
the price was fair .
i was put off by the strip mall exterior .
the interior put my concerns to rest .
the food was very good .
"but then again , this is not fast food ."
"plain and simply asian fare , but tasty enough ."
the service has been good on both visits .
the selection was pretty much what i was expecting .
here is where it gets good .
the service here was standard for a buffet .
they were pretty quick at handling the lines .
all seating is on wooden picnic bench style seats .
one thing to keep in mind is the noise .
the food here was satisfactory imo .
so a few of us bought shots for him .
"on top of everything , the price is awesome ."
"then we noticed the name , heart attack grill ."
the shot is pretty strong .
service during our time was very good .
this place totally is a secret .
the service was not a good experience .
nor did the second pie .
kinda like a new yorker but worse .
"second , it was very very oily ."
even though they did not serve us well .
"bottom line is , the name matches perfectly ."
nobody should know about this place .
service here is good .
what more can you ask for .
it was convenient and the timing was right .
worst auto zone ever !
everyone there is a fucking idiot !
the food exceeded all expectations .
we even bought one of the shirts .
well no worries neither am i .
small lil bar thats grinding out top notch food .
overall the experience was bearable .
this is a long shot .
all i can say was wow .
this place made hooters seem like mcdonald ' s .
do n't pay for round trip .
exceptionally courteous and professional .
went on a weds .
night before a downtown show .
place is about 0/0 full .
i will not give them another chance .
? ? ? is this my problem ?
0 0 ' ' fishy tasting .
very sub-par for the money .
their boba tea is ridiculously good .
there are a lot of better options for burgers .
what is good is that the food is fresh .
calzone is very good .
to me it was worse than frozen pizza .
there always seems to be a problem .
i like my pizza ny style .
but this place is great .
basically its subway but for pizza .
<UNK> make you a personal pizza as you watch .
they are always extremely n ice .
the place is always clean .
the diet coke is great .
they smile and hook you up .
pizza how ever you want it .
only if boston losses the world series .
this is the last time i eat here .
my bad luck continues they burned our <UNK> .
why send out <UNK> food .
i like this place .
the wood fired oven burns parts of the pizza .
good if you like extra crispy pizza .
so my mistake i went to try it .
but most of the pizza had no cheese .
so yeah im very <UNK> .
and i posted this on facebook asking .
no one i know likes this place .
so i didnt bother telling them it burned .
usually the service is great .
thanks for not chomping the meal .
enjoy your one star review .
and guess what i wo n't be back .
i like the style of the place .
i like that the free internet works .
my honest opinion is that its the management .
some things are not common sense .
setting out drinking on a resting table .
you ca n't mix two batches together .
they should always be cooked the same .
but today was awesome .
probably then best diet coke and calzone in arizona .
the sweetest servers in scottsdale .
burgers with hatch peppers my personal favorite .
which they probably have with rum .
last two times they cut the bagel wrong .
se e review i left at two other locations .
they gave me a taste of the pastor .
trip three <UNK> burned the carne asada tacos .
<UNK> <UNK> tell me they make it charred .
but who likes burned food .
walk out and notice they gave bear claw .
so i go in as they bring out glazed .
why be in service business and give customers attitude .
my only <UNK> if they read this .
and the counter people could be better .
they never seem to be <UNK> about the menu .
but maybe the solution is chicago style .
i ' m a pizza snob pretty good pizza .
ca n't say its the best in az .
but the food is good .
didnt think the flavor was to good .
this is the real deal .
diet coke was great .
fries very good because they where fresh .
if you like those you will like this place .
its little caeser style .
but i thought the stromboli was terrible .
i should have got a pizza i <UNK> .
i ' m going to be honest here .
but i feel the need to report a problem .
and the service is great in this place .
one of the best in the city .
but this is the second time this has happened .
there is simply no excuse .
its cheaper burned the calzone .
service is best in city .
maybe the best desert i ever had .
you need coupon to get that .
not sure why the ratings are so low .
i like this place .
best meatballs in the world ?
so the word is spreading .
i had bowl with brown rice and shrimp .
they even have diet coke .
<UNK> tacos very good .
really good slightly salty but it is mexican food .
i have a few issues with <UNK> meal .
also this particular outback has consistently been terrible .
not terrible just <UNK> to start with .
soda was very good and bread was fresh .
you got a second chance do it right ?
i do n't remember the reason .
burger grease is <UNK> .
two kinds tasted like <UNK> .
the corn on the cob was interesting .
if you want tacos not great .
some i am sure will disagree with my review .
i recommend trying for you self .
the food isnt hot .
salsa and diet coke was great .
authentic new mexican food .
maybe they can fix this place should be great .
do n't love chinese but they have thai stuff .
if you like chinese you should be very happy .
even the diet coke was tasty .
they just do things right .
counter service but the food comes out fast .
ot would ne like a <UNK> review .
no hi welcome or anything like that .
god thing its counter <UNK> ce .
as you know from reading my other reviews .
and not much of a meat eater .
this place is amazing .
mac and <UNK> the best i have had .
the baked potatoe is the best i have had .
ten times better than cheese cake factory .
i recommend going for the filet instead .
this is a notch above that .
there is little care to quality .
not to say that the service is bad .
i have had much worse food .
i have been there a dozen times .
if you love mexican food like me .
then you should try los dos molinos .
other wise i would have given it one stars .
my main complaint is this place closing early .
tonight is just wasnt good .
also they have diet coke .
"food came out uncooked , slow service ."
server tried to tell me thats how it is .
no visit from a manager or anything .
i have a lot issues with this place .
prob good as a bar .
but no excuse to have cold sliders .
no wonder the line is longer than chipolte .
one of my favorite joints of all time .
ate there last night .
what i tasted was good .
cool music and internet always works .
country music and no one greater us .
its a ton better cold than dominos .
and cut it down the center straight .
rice and beans not bad .
overall i enjoyed the meal .
but for arizona this place is lame .
i tried rating it .
why would you drench a sandwich in dressing .
are you staying to see a grand .
the meat was high end trays like a roast .
the problem wad it was very beefy .
i know what your thinking beef is beefy .
could be the quality of the ingredients .
maybe not the freshest .
i had a beef burrito .
maybe i like fresh carne asada .
even <UNK> has better flavor beef .
the diet coke was very good .
thanks for not chomping the meal .
this place is either great or horrible .
no kidding they are not all rotten .
rotate your food to ensure its always fresh .
great place to be .
it just feels like living hanging here .
it ' s almost better than being in hawaii .
had prime rib and king crab legs .
crab want bad i enjoyed it .
tough to eat s meal like <UNK> with water .
wish the had coke .
salad was great cold plate and cold fork .
i really enjoyed my trip here .
nice big bar and patio .
and very good service .
0 star place for sure .
great quality food and ambiance for a 0:0 meal .
just recently moved to las vegas .
painted desert is now my home course .
course management is at a premium .
"fast , fast , fast ."
on top of that they <UNK> in unexpected ways .
they did a good job at a fair price .
took my <UNK> in for oil change .
poker room staff stealing from dealers .
what more could i ask for ?
his <UNK> and knowledge about contemporary taiwanese cuisine .
tip generously but as you do whisper juan pablo .
do yourself the favor and try .
"oh , and killer pies ."
kudos and recommendations from me .
this location is ` ` ok ' ' .
i asked him if his company supplied this variety .
this has always been a a ten star place !
they certainly tried for me .
"with todd , no problem ."
it is n't just good food .
"kudos to , kathy ! ! ! ."
that is part of the fine dining experience .
. this is not your typical store .
the merchandise <UNK> <UNK> an interesting variety .
this is a tricky one to write .
meals are also provided .
it requires work on the part of the individual .
i am proof of the fact that it works .
that is never the case .
i asked myself does that first review still apply .
the staff makes every effort to see that occurs .
it was better then .
now it ' s an ok place .
that makes me a happy camper .
they have used the space wisely .
"they buy , sell and trade and more ."
"no questions asked , they replaced them for me ."
that ' s a real plus in itself .
two cars later i finally got there .
they are courteous and knowledgeable .
"been there , done that ."
i did notice david n ' s review .
i spoke with the owner of the bar .
i was quite surprised to say the least .
there are enough places you can do that .
the interior is nothing to right home about .
this is a real compliment from me .
- lrb - this gentleman certainly was n't that .
one more reason to consider using fox plumbing .
promotion lasts for 0 year from date of purchase .
subject to the general terms .
people that work there are nice enough .
i will make one suggestion .
i really debated between three and four stars .
just make sure what time you get an appointment .
the moral of the story is this .
i ' ll be going back .
minor plus to all of this .
the food literally made me ill .
it is a trendy place with an interesting menu .
the service was <UNK> had no complaints .
no reply as yet .
negative one star for this one .
that by far makes up the difference .
i had to wait longer than i expected .
maybe just my attitude .
they also provide exceptional medical services .
they have closed this location .
this is typical of the place .
i ' d suggest it .
that ' s not saying much is it .
my father ' s corporate offices were nearby .
the crew is a reflection of his attitude .
now the good news .
dr . <UNK> has done all my root canals .
they explain exactly what you can expect .
"whatever , they do it right for you ."
it was a a very positive experience .
"frankly , dr . <UNK> is my guy ."
the service was excellent and the food very good .
"once again , excellent service ."
the personal touch of their employees makes a difference .
a special compliment to this store .
next time i will go for something stronger though .
it almost looked almost like a thick soup .
i had to rent a wheel <UNK> .
i can do this at postino .
i questioned whether to rate this five stars .
they have yet to foul up my order !
in addition the parking is plentiful .
i enjoy going in this place .
it ca n't be that bad .
that is the truth .
this is not the companies fault .
they have lost so many of their strong dancers .
they run out fast .
this place grows on you .
they might be a little higher than other places .
i can only say positive things about going there .
i spent years in retail .
the operation is separated into two sections .
the first warehouse is merchandise that is sold retail .
i di n't make it that far .
i will fill you in on what the do .
i put on the most expensive virus system possible .
nothing helps this machine i was sold .
end result is i am <UNK> the thing .
"buy furniture here , buy office supplies ."
buy a computer ... never .
it is just the opposite .
they have a really interesting selection of used whatever .
ever hear of the word <UNK> ?
i graduated from asu .
i ' ve seen worse .
phoenix needs more stores like this .
the attitude of the staff is terrific .
two things you should know that affect my attitude .
i ' ve gotten ignored by young and old .
there are other places to go .
how hard is it to kill a <UNK> !
id prefer to buy better quality to begin with .
how did i find out about it ?
i hesitated to put inexpensive or moderate .
check it out for yourselves .
you say no reason not to return .
i have no problem with relaxed service .
that is not an excuse to be borderline neglected .
"who cares , treasure is to be found ."
"at this point , i am usually very afraid ."
they will treat you with the same respect .
their regular retail location is the roosevelt store .
she was n't kidding .
what truly impressed me was the beef .
my surprise at how reasonable the cost was .
her major complaint is the food .
very different and quite tasty .
i would n't go back there <UNK> stars .
this is boot nirvana !
now the question of prices must be addressed .
they are from moderate to pricey .
it is a fairly large restaurant .
the serving staff are all quite young .
how many places does that happen anywhere ?
what is even better is the staff .
i ended up in the hospital on thanksgiving .
the meat falls of the bone .
i fully expect a <UNK> email from the owner .
this had to be the worse .
kudos to pam in <UNK> .
as for the rest of the staff in er .
instead it did n't drip .
overall it was a good experience .
kathy will never get another cent of my money .
let that tell you something about the food here .
i can tell you they have good lemonade .
they do have things that are n't fried .
good to be able to say this about blake !
it ' s not a tony place .
kind of fun for all .
i do n't recommend doing business with this merchant .
i should have known better .
profit from my mistake .
exactly the opposite was my experience with these people .
here is how they handled it .
"always good food , always good service ."
speaking of following the norm .
really nice people there and it was fast .
i rarely ever hear the little rug rat !
the service was excellent .
that quality of service really stands out for me .
i like this place .
i wrote my initial <UNK> almost a year ago .
the reviews that i read are n't encouraging .
what we had was good but nothing to special .
this guy can makes everything seem better .
"unfortunately , i am limited in this respect ."
so the bottom bun got soggy .
they have eight kinds of bacon to choose from .
<UNK> does n't disappoint in this area .
tyler h was n't kidding when he said confusing .
i certainly hope their attitude has changed .
recently i rented from this location of u haul .
"thank you , mr . <UNK> ."
the very reasonable price surprised me .
it only made sense .
quality means more to me than quantity .
the ingredients are fresh and tasty .
nice interior that is clean and simple .
they have a nice patio out front .
"jonathan , behind the counter , really is helpful ."
i trusted him and had to agree .
good thinking on the part of jonathan !
"put the zombies in the gutter , please ."
i ca n't say enough for their staff .
the employees will take time to get things right .
you certainly ca n't get bored there .
nice place to go for casual greek .
"maggie , our server , provided flawless service ."
who ever planned it deserves a medal .
it is big without being intimidating .
this safeway is that good .
you might want to consider what i do .
even that can be interesting at times .
talk about having a death wish ?
i ' ll spend my money there .
do n't go in near closing .
they were responding to continuing complaints .
this place does something to my head .
i finally got to this place .
very interesting <UNK> it out if you go .
nice crowd but not to busy .
food was good but nothing exceptional .
i liked the old building .
you had better agree with her way of thinking .
whether that would be enough might be questionable .
do n't expect to use a credit card .
never hurts to burn a few calories .
nice place to do business with .
i worked in retail for many years .
this place is very inconsistent .
get the scallops medium rare .
stumbled on this place by accident .
my wife went crazy for the gazpacho !
tapas portions ranged from minuscule to fair .
hidden gem inside of the circus circus .
excellent meal and a fair price .
you do not see that with companies these days .
i ca n't say enough about our experience .
"thanks , fogo de chã <UNK> o !"
not sure how the food is here .
friendly staff and good food .
i ' d definitely return .
"my filet was overcooked , dry , and flavorless ."
the sides were boring and the deserts were unremarkable .
in the top 0 steak restaurants ever for me .
decent italian restaurant off the strip .
"a little on the expensive side , though ."
this is without question my favorite straight bar .
it ' s definitely a different place overall .
thus the 0 star rather than 0 star review .
i certainly can not argue this place .
keep up the great work guys .
i got an italian sub and a strawberry shake .
i have nothing bad to say .
i will be coming back .
even in that company the restaurant held its own .
this place is awesome .
"great atmosphere , good service , and amazing food ."
i ' ll be going back again for sure .
best hawaiian restaurant in las vegas .
the food is spectacular .
went for lunch and it was moderately busy .
service is surprisingly fast .
not a word from the owner .
is this for real ?
hope this is helpful .
and naturally no refund .
the ribs - the baby backs were delicious .
"moist , tender , fall <UNK> good ."
it should be called the <UNK> or <UNK> rib .
it was nothing special not worth the money .
the breakfast was far worse than the lunch .
these guys were the best .
i would highly highly recommend .
at those guys i have experience two different sets .
traveling from out of state .
green & red salsa was very good .
chili rellenos and carnitas were very good .
just another <UNK> better overpriced steak house in vegas .
the service is outstanding .
great service with a personal touch .
love the 0-0 and white widow .
is this indicative of the level of care .
highly recommended ! ! absolutely delicious .
each cup is a giant sugar bomb but <UNK> .

food was good but not anything extraordinary .

one of the best starbucks in the valley .
this is place is definitely crappy .
i do not pay up for mediocrity .
0 star price for 0 star food .

prime rib was very tasty .
i tried the chipotle honey bbq bacon burger .

the hawaiian pie is okay .
some great places in the area .
the sauce was tangy and some kick to it .

could be great with some minor menu <UNK> .
that ' s about it .

<UNK> scale : 0.0 .

can i get a real bagel place in uptown ?
it ' s a typical chain bagel store .
they serve a small selection of sandwiches .
their cold cuts are so-so .
"holla the panthers stink , the stadium is nice ."
"it ' s me <UNK> , im <UNK> ."
was n't too impressed with the place .
<UNK> still uses <UNK> .
they have phenomenal manicotti and great pizza .
"must try though , so make the trip ."

this place needs improvement in the meats department .

' ' ca n't go wrong .
"it ' s a good time , i promise ."
the beer ' s tasty .

the floor upstairs feels like it might cave in .
first time i have ever been to pittsburgh .

it had a solid atmosphere .
now on to the ambience of the place .
<UNK> your quick bbq fix .
<UNK> scale - 0.0 .

thanks for a tasty meal and a great conversation .
had great meal here .
great place for kids in vegas .
price is great at free .
best shop i ' ve ever been in .

where have you been all my life .
to the owners ... nicely done .
thanks for opening in city north .
"has a well stocked bar , plenty of tvs ."
this a great place for event dinners as well .
pretty awful asian - con - fusion food .
"nothing fancy , but good people and good selection ."
very professional company with quality customer service .
"no pushy sales tactics , just good service ."
the food is fantastic .
i think they should just scrap this casino .
owner sat down and had drinks with us .
ragu would have been a better alternative .
"on the negative , arrival was a major hassle ."
my last issue is the most egregious .
"great location , across from the paris hotel elevators ."
never felt pressured in to purchasing any <UNK> service .
this place is the worst .
do not rent from here .
the food was great as well .
what a scam of a restaurant .
ordered the fish tacos and they were good .
i ' d be interested in their breakfast .
elevator system is a nightmare .
the combination of flavors are indescribable .
i felt uncomfortable going in with my girlfriend .
well policy is policy .
rice was under cooked and dry as hell .
i hope this place gets shut down .
the orange juice was very fresh and tasty .
my girlfriend grape jelly .

would look to know a good body shop .
fish and chips delicious .
replace the cook or get a couple of them .
update * they honored their mistake .
the staff was freindly .
very busy during lunch .
why bother ... you get what you get .
salad bar ` ` iffy ' ' .
. sure the other cutters are good .
this place was fucking bullshit .
place looks pretty nice tho
got a big pastrami sandwich and a round <UNK> .
counter people could all be a little nicer .
good to see the food has n't dropped off .
"tasty , fresh & hot ."
pricing will hurt them .
maybe a few more varieties .
wish the donuts were just a little smaller .
both meals were outstanding .
everything about how this place is run is top-notch .
family restaurant with excellent service and food .
this is a great establishment with an awesome owner .
the food is always outstanding .
this one is dead to me .

a hip <UNK> on traditional vietnamese food .
bouncer : what ' s your name ?
i ' ll keep this update pretty simple .
they definitely changed them for the extreme worse .
best indian in montreal .
chef <UNK> d knocks it out of the park !
the mole enchiladas were a sensation .
"take the biscuits and gravy , for instance ."
and it is absolutely unbelievable .
the menus were crisp and <UNK> out .
"so , i use ` ` ship to store ."
the entire experience was cordial and polished .
the food certainly matched the incredible view .
the crew seems slow and careless .
the biscuits were rock hard .
a very unique menu full of amazing stuff .
"i could not blame her , only her management ."
service was ` ` standard ' ' .
might bring wifey back .

ties for $ 00 ?
this place is the best of the best .
"great food , great atmosphere , and <UNK> drinks ."
my wife ordered the barbecue chicken burger .
most airports offer small sizes and everything tastes processed .
glorious group spot in vegas .
the food here is excellent .
the sandwich seemed very light on the meat .
not worth the trip .
"cheap teriyaki , prepared fast ."
sometimes you get a decent waiter .
"the mood was great , great lighting and atmosphere ."
"overall , good stuff ."
"in a nutshell , an ayce it is not ."
roll selection was slightly better .
and i gave this place about 00 chances .
their pancakes are creative and incredible .
this pleased my ego .
you ' ll be happy you did .

they defiantly look the part .
this place delivers on great mexican food !
this place is ok .

i have been coming here for years .
"however , there is one dish that wins ."
great after late nights drinking or gambling .
a good breakfast in a really trendy restaurant .
nice 0 start hotel .
food was mediocre at best .
not much not to like here .
good uptown place for mexican .
i will never take my dogs anywhere else !
generally i like quality inn as a brand .
the shuttle driver was great .
you own one why not fix it ?
the air conditioner was loud .
also hire a bartender for the busy season .
asu is right down the street ask around .
clam <UNK> soup was just ok .
great spot for views .
they came out in about 00 mins .
small and not much flavor .
lack of security tonight .
it ' s a great wendy ' s .
"service is outstanding , <UNK> is what it is ."
consistently the worse mcdonalds i have seen .
worthless management / ownership .
"job done <UNK> , refusal to correct ."
this place is insane !
a ca n't miss experience .
i had a return visit .
as always the place is a monument to excess .
emphasis though is on chocolate in many forms .
frites <UNK> is a local fast food chain .
"first , the fries are quite tasty ."

. customer service below average .
employees think we cant hear / understand spanish .

what ' s not to like ?
incredible attention to detail and very service oriented .
very good burgers and curly fries .
feels like an old diner of sorts .
burger and beer was around $ 00
the chicken was n't bad but not great .
the installers this company has are artists and <UNK> .
"pricing is high , quality is low ."
in and out within 0 hours .
stopped by around lunch time on a friday .
"wife ordered the ruben sandwich , never again ."
i booked two rooms .
i stayed two nights .

i like the place .
they make a pretty good sandwich .
<UNK> better than subway .
decent car wash offering the works .
"check in was swift , informative , and pleasant ."
"am i a pho expert , absolutely not ."
very good value and very tasty .
so why choose jenni pho over others ?
the variety of the meats seemed adequate .
it would be interesting to see the difference .

i was born and raised in new york .
these are the best bagels i have ever had .
it feels like new york inside the bagel man .

the seasoning is a little thin and oily side .
ordered medium and even the hot .
and there was n't much of a difference .
the <UNK> is good .
limited options in terms of meat toppings .
no tendon or tripe .
just the rare beef .
portions and price are very reasonable as well .
however their main office was rude and deceptive .
i contacted the company at 0000 .
they make the wings when you order .
service at this location is just the worst .

you may be disappointed with the end result .
"tears of happiness , guys ."
this sandwich is the epitome of filling your <UNK> .

you ' ll probably be satisfied in the end .
too many conflicting flavors .

family owned and operated .
all things chinese are at their finest .
they have the whole <UNK> of edible creatures available .
from jelly fish to duck .
it is a culture shock .
place is great grilled japanese food .
the white rice is sushi grade long and sticky .
beans are made right .
food was n't the most authentic .
but i ' m not hearing all the hype .
the tacos arrived simply wrapped in foil .
they were both top notch .
the music is really what sets this place apart .
how is this normal .
how is this normal .
food on the strip is expensive and mediocre .
this review is for the lower priced cafe area .
our water and drink glasses were frequently left empty .

the place was very clean very well <UNK> .
wish i ' d discover this sooner .
my wife and i really enjoyed this place .
the brisket was fantastic .
the wait staff was very friendly and attentive .
the cornbread was excellent .
i think they just <UNK> and ripped us off .
the menu has recently been changed for the worse .

ca n't wait to take my office buddies .
easy to eat for $ 00 or so .
"no help , no suggestions ."
... at least good gelato is !
but did n't ask if there was a problem .
"the staff was friendly , attentive and courteous ."
and for about $ 0 or $ 00 .
did i mention ... .
my buddies and i like it for lunch .
these guys are horrible .
never been in any trouble and show everyone respect .
"best bet , go somewhere else ."
"service was timely , friendly and knowledgable ."
"food was , as always , very well made ."
someone three years ago complained about the same issue .
perhaps this time you will take this more seriously .
but i will be coming back with my wife !
this place used to be great .
now this place is junk .
"excellent service , clean building , and great food ."
four stars ... i will go back .

they have peroni on tap which is good .
the warm bread before the meal is excellent .

"great selection , friendly and knowledgeable ."
these are my dent guys and they work magic .
it is truly amazing what they can do .

parking can be tight at times .
"two stars , i will avoid this location ."
the concessions are very average and very pricey .
two stars ... i avoid if possible .
read the reviews and you will see why .
five stars cool place absolutely filled with texas memorabilia .
parking is a bit tight but worth it .
"great patio , dog friendly ."
"three stars , not great but not horrible ."
might stop in again .
i will definitely use in the future .
the beer was absurdly cold ... like a <UNK> .
would stop in again given the chance .
the cashiers look like crack heads .
two stars ... not a good value .
<UNK> is the best .
"great atmosphere , sort of pricey though ."
they also have a really good lunch special .
pretty typical mexican fare .
reminds me of chipotle .
had a chicken burrito and it was tasty .
had lunch here with some co-workers .
this place is awesome !
the service here is unparalleled !
well ok let ' s do something ?
i get my wallet .
no wine menu was present on the blackboard .
if you need a locksmith look no further .
<UNK> to this place .
<UNK> garbage all over .
guess i should have expected this in vegas .
this place is just awesome .
i went back once more on my short trip .
the sandwich was well assembled .
will do in a pinch for a poutine fix .
relatively generous portions and staff have a great attitude .
solid barista skills - former barista from cafe edgar .
clean and crisp w / awesome lounge vibe .
the price is what makes this a three .
this place blew our minds .
my juice had 0 or 0 ingredients btw .
looking forward to trying a chicken wrap next time .
talk about an unethical place .
crooks all the way around .
gums are n't even red anymore .
crooks all the way around .
the pasta dishes are just average .
the price kills the star rating .
"unfortunately , they close at 0 pm ."
this time it had pepperoni on it .
this place is terrible .
i paid in full ... no financing or anything .
they spent roughly an hour setting it up .
big surprise ... relax the back failed me again .
the perfect pastrami and the <UNK> are my favorites .
"plus , lots of different salsas to choose from ."
i suggest going around off peak hours .
i rate this place 0.0 stars .
"the food is delicious , seasoned and well prepared ."
i might be back to try other things .
sides : baked beans and mac & cheese .
the hot links were quite peppery and succulent .
service was fine and the decor was nice .
"the <UNK> - mozzarella cheese , tomato , pesto ."
i also tried the <UNK> noodles with shredded chicken .
he ' s a very friendly and knowledgeable guy .
southern style chicken fried steak .
vegan <UNK> bacon and honey for almonds and agave .
i believe the place stands out for the <UNK> .
this is my first trip to nacho daddy .
- rrb - beers for $ 00 .
the pork was cooked evenly with the sauce .
all around a great place to checkout .
"these coffees are strong , ultra smooth and satisfying ."
i would prefer that they make it in house .
' ' or what ' s your favorite dessert ?
overall i feel a three star is sufficient .
and they even asked me about my feedback .
the staff was friendly and provided great customer service .
i ordered bacon and eggs and a bacon donut .
my girlfriend ordered the paradise valley omelet .
these guys are worth it .
just amazing acts with great showmanship .
hey in life everyone deserves a second chance .
business is going well .
"xs in vegas standards , looks pretty old actually ."
you wo n't regret it .
to me that ' s the quintessential vegas necessity .
that number alone gave it 0 stars for me .
another standout act was the <UNK> in the beginning .
"yeah , like that ."
nathan also has a vegas residency at planet hollywood .
also got a autographed picture of him too .
. time goes by way too fast .
and just like 00 years ago .
the performers that night were all on point .
as many others have said .
the crowd was <UNK> at that point .
that alone was around $ 00.00 before tip .
one of the best shows in town by far .
easily the best sandwich i ' ve ever had .
so i said what the hell .
this place is the shit .
just sat and shot the shit with this guy .
finally a barber that is n't intimidating or weird .
the question was ignored .
i ordered a pizza last night .
what kind of bull shit is that ?
the pizza was great .
the staff here is amazing .
btw i started going here a couple weeks ago .
do you like real coffee and real people ?
and pick them up on my lunch .
thank you chris and eddy .
keep up the great work !
"ok , this is long over due ."
the food is fantastic .
do n't go there 00 minutes before close .
food came out quick .
that ' s just idiotic .
i had the dam jumper and the chuck <UNK> .
you ' ll get neither at this establishment .
"the first waitress was knowledgeable , that was good ."
"in any case , meh ."
"its good , not great ."
this place is way better than the street .
food : nothing special .
"the sushi was epic fail , as mentioned ."
the other asian foods were pretty bad too .
about 0/0 of the stuff there was starch based .
the hyped bone marrow was n't that good .
we got in towards the tail end of breakfast .
the brisket at lunch was pretty dang good too .
"september 00th , 0000 ."
they are no longer .
it ' s a saturday or sunday tradition !

next we order the fish tasting appetizer .
feta was of poor quality also .
just nasty looks and attitude .
icy silence from the staff .
last time here stephanie the hostess was fantastic .
but the damage was done .
however the steaks came up way short .
a patty melt was served as well .
first visit to <UNK> <UNK> grill .
food and beverages were excellent for bar food .
another great suggestion ron .
perfectly mulled brandy old fashioned - check .
the house fries were excellent as well .

the wine list was actually quite good .
was it better than a chain restaurant ?
what i got was dressed up ground round .
felt like one rung over a chain place .
the lamb chop with goat cheese fondue is amazing .
service has been great as well .
unfortunately humble pie just does n't deliver .
went late at night around 00pm after peak crowds .
service was great by everyone .
it has a light and subtle fruity flavor .
<UNK> loco was very tasty .
wish there was one in los angeles .
the room we were in featured a kitchenette .
"valet is quick , guest services are quite accommodating ."
the gym is huge and well appointed .
the quality is far superior at veranda however .
not to say that hob is sub-par .
- they have a habit of burning burgers bad .
' ' when its time to find your waitress .
"- dirty , messy tables , crap everywhere ."
- their french fry portions have gotten smaller .
- really expensive hot dogs .
no i ' m not joking .
"0 for large fries , 0 for anything less ."
- their television ' s are not well placed .
"looking into this place , they have no website ."
not a good first impression .
advice to <UNK> - get a website .

the fries cost more to get as a side .
"um , apparently everyone except this place ."
- stop being cheap .
pro ' s : - good appetizer menu .
- all of the food is pretty good .
- their taco bar is the definition of cheap .
- the staff is quite nice .
- it is expensive .
i ' ve been going there for a year .

they are not 00/0 and close early .
their fries are long and taste good .
they should price that at $ 0.00 .
it was the ` ` orange chicken ' ' .
it would be 0 stars if it was available .
i started working with <UNK> in 0000 .

great food and the people are always nice .
the generous toppings were fresh and tasty .
the beer selection was excellent and from local breweries .
"and , the lamb rib appetizer was all fat ."
steaks were grilled to correct temp & tasted great .
quite possibly the best place out there .
nothing to brag about .

the subs both hot and cold are great .
my new spot for poutine in montreal .

the best spot downtown for lunch .
my beautiful wife brought me here for lunch .
i had the california turkey on ciabatta bread .
both were very fresh and tasted great .
zombie waitress with no personality .
place has great potential .
short term profit instead of customer loyalty .
stopped in this morning for an oil change .

the big draw is the alaskan king crab legs .
a fantastic accountant i have been using for years .

a very good and hearty meal .
in fact it seems to be the trend .
shame on the perch .

thats honesty which is greatly appreciated .
one of the best spots in chandler .

the calamari is average at best .
i do n't feel like the price was justified .
i would rather go to city hall .
i ' ll keep this short and simple .
they get you in and out quickly .
what else would expect from a 0th generation <UNK> ?

good experience with a well known car rental company .
found this place on yelp and headed over .
reminds me of ocean ' s eleven .
what more can you ask for ?
this is a monster sprawling mall .
"all in all , a very complete mall ."
this place is off the main road .
the menu is fairly straightforward .
it was ok but nothing special to me .
shame it was like the service - non existent .
the <UNK> <UNK> noodle soup was like pho .
it was ok but nothing special .
guess this place seems more vietnamese to me .
why would n't i compare it ?
that ' s how a rating can be generated !
lying to the customer gets 0 star .
i ca n't believe how good it was !
the biscuits are very good .
they are more of a home style potato .
the eggs were cooked perfectly .
which is the cost of a gallon !

small price to pay i suppose .
what the hell is going on .
wtf ? ? ? my favorite restaurant .
"i got the special , which was sea bass ."
"very personal , prompt , and inviting ."
"no joke , they were even the right size ."
the best enchilada style burros in town .
all the sandwiches i ' ve had are awesome .
the daily specials are a no-brainer .
many would also consider this consumer fraud .
a completely different dish than what i ordered .
i do n't see that being an ongoing concern .
i ordered the baby back ribs once .
the beer selection is outstanding as well .
everything there is great .
apparently the casing or latch assembly was loose .
"no parts , no major issues ."
do yourself a favor and give <UNK> a call .
dont do business with riverview .
it used to be called larry miller riverview toyota .
they are shady crooks .
they refuse to send it to me .
so let me smack that down right now .
like i believe you do n't keep service records .
red flag after red flag .
i told him that was not accurate .

but that was a few years back .
food here was great .
the crab fingers were mediocre and very messy .
the restaurant was cramped .
a guy outside had a <UNK> firearm .

business trip brought me to montreal .
room was clean and contemporary .
very satisfied for what it is .
not the best environment if you have kids .
mini golf was run down .
tennis courts and basketball looked fine .
bit that ' s the best it got .
the food is worth every penny .
sonic should be ashamed of themselves .
they really know how lower standards .
no reason ? ? ? what a joke .
"huge portions , service that treats you like family ."
now not worth the effort .
drove to two locations to try this place .
great deal on livingsocial .
two weekend nights or three weekdays for $ 000 .
check out this link ... .
http://url really good place .
they do a nice job with the pizza .
could easily <UNK> four or five people .
- j / k - place is pretty cool .
i think you have to put things in perspective .
another thing people complained about is the baggage fees .
if you plan ahead you ' re good .
"also , you get a carry on item ."
people - you have a choice .
you ' re going cheap know your place .
i should have known better .
wo n't make that mistake again .
' ' ok - no problem .
- that ' s just stupid .
at a minimum just switch to a bar menu .
honestly this place sucks .
that ' s the worst thing i could say .
very fresh food and authentic italian taste .
must visit when you come to mt washington .
what ' s all the yelling about with that ?
definitely caters to a lower end latino clientele .
not much money put on decor .
the chopped salmon salad was incredible .
great for groups and super friendly staff .
i have been without hot water approximately 0 times .
this place has more smokers than non smokers .
"to my right , left and above ."
"if you smoke , you ' ll love it ."
just another dunkin donuts .
he wo n't get my $ 000 again .
"great coffee , atmosphere and food ."
"they have wine , beer and open mic evenings ."
the people working are very friendly and helpful .
thankfully not many smokers around me either .
that ' s another $ 000 .

the most impressive station appeared to be the barbeque .
the lamb chops and sliders were very good .

i played 0 dollar craps .

no gambling on premises .
the bad points : 0 .
"expensive , marginal food ."
the hot tub smelled like a chlorine tub .

these are just the sides .
at that table with be a small round card .
it ' s what the place is built for .
<UNK> lies the real true appeal .
"not just the food , which is generally excellent ."
desert was also quite good .
"it is certainly worth it , though ."
people screw up pizza a lot .
grimaldi ' s actually does .
sorry ... i ' m a jersey native .
it ' s pretty much that simple .
"the ingredients were crisp , fresh and tasty ."
"the soups were also tasty , and well flavored ."
not <UNK> like many do .
"if you like soup , go here ."
over priced and tasteless food .

"for the starch , we had potatoes au gratin ."
"again , i highly recommend it ."
the big top may be part of it .
and you know what else ?
i hate gambling in those huge ultra luxury resorts .
you know how they built those ?
it is what it is .
i like gambling at circus circus .
"or so goes my logic , anyway ."
either option is better then the flamingo .
the bowling lanes were also great .
it depends on how you look at it .
this one lies somewhere in the middle .
"but hey , its a nightclub ."
grinding like a mad man on the dance floor ?
"what the hell , a-ok ."
which you probably did .
you just solved yourself a crime !
- rrb - and a balcony .
you ' ll probably think its ok .
i went there 00 days ago .
starting to become fond of this place .
seems like this place is <UNK> by the day .
. been going here for almost 0 yrs .
"unfortunately , not everything could be perfect ."
the main event - the burger .
the patty was under-seasoned or not seasoned at all .
a whopper is more satisfying than these burgers .
reasonably priced and a fast turnaround .
shirts are cleaned and pressed well .
pants and suits are also well done .
arturo is the true definition of a professional .
cleaned up very nicely after the project also .
even the back row are decent seats .
negatives - that damn snail .
their pan pizza is <UNK> as chicago deep dish .
"the fries are good , but not the best ."

you have to try this .
simply the best bbq in town .
and that attitude is shared everywhere in this property .
"nobody wants you here , or even cares ."
take it from a local expert .
"my bill was $ 00,000 for nothing ."
the total between them ?
this medical facility needs to be shut down .
it ' s a complete fraud .
they said they would contact customer service .
she did waive the $ 000.00 delivery fee .
the delivery arrived at about 0:00 pm .
the two men returned my tools and departed .
the fry ' s store beats safeway hands down .
i guarantee you wo n't be disappointed .

drinks are amazingly priced .
no acknowledgment at all by no one .
best in the valley for sure .
service was fantastic and seafood tower was crazy .

<UNK> had to come back twice to repair it .
this place is mediocre at best .
it is what it is .
the food and cocktails were great .
awesome combination of vietnamese food and american dining style .
this ai n't pretty .
the servers are dressed up in traditional mexican clothing .
the tortillas were average .
not creamy enough at all .
"0 star , but they earned it ."
pathetic for a large town like charlotte .
what a fun low key casino .
i thought it was ok nothing to brag about .
beautiful people at this casino resort .
the bartender was friendly and quick with my beers .
i told the wife and off we went .
the suggestion was great and right on the money .
the chicks were hot and sexy .
all were wearing lingerie and very friendly .
the drinks were made well and food is good .

the calamari had another sauce that was delicious .
today as soon as i woke up i called .
every visit with her has been a pleasant one .
the inside of luna is very nice .
there was a lot of 00 + .
"great food , questionable customer service ."
i would suggest ordering togo .
this place is in a busy area .
with a side of rice and beans of course .
it has pictures of mexican families on the walls .
but never raisin pineapple .
literally walking distance away from my front door .
"not too hard , not too soft ."
paid attention to getting every spot .
great hand finger wrist and arm massage .

i came here twice during my stay at gvr .
does n't get much better than in a casino .
went during a ufc fight .
they have a couple bj tables in there .
do n't know about the food .
better than l & l but not by much .
brought my 00 nissan <UNK> .
"great service , a very honest and hardworking person ."
$ 00 for a mixed drink is absolutely ridiculous !
"had a blast , will be back again !"
"monaco foccacia , happy hour , and 00oz beers ."
got ta try it .
sean the service was spot on .
josh and the crew rocked .
pay attention to your customers .

correction : simply excellent steak .
the worst item was the pulled pork nachos .

great desserts and cakes that are never frozen .
do n't go here on sunday afternoons .
bbq beef was more fat than meat .

this place is amazing .
huge variety and selection of food .
totally recommend johnny b ' s to anyone .
great casino hotel with service to match .
maybe i caught them on a bad night ?
i found southwest <UNK> .
usually for less than what they quoted .
what an unfortunate mistake for us .
the menu features <UNK> mediterranean foods that sounded great .
man was that a mistake on my part .
i always get wings or chicken alfredo .
the problem comes with the general <UNK> .
still a great show and would recommend it .
perfectly cooked seasoned well burgers .
these are burgers you will dream about .

and then i ate it .
one tip of advice is dont order crispy pork !

you pay admission and you get into both places .
the buffet was very nice but pretty standard food .
try the lamb chops and sea bass !
from start to finish i was entertained .
- the bar / lounge on top is lame .
- no good attractions to draw you in .
go shoot machine guns !
what else could you ask for ?
$ 00-00 to shoot a machine gun .
it ' s basically a diner with vegas flair .
exactly what you would expect from a diner .
always wonder when a place has all five stars .
what great street tacos .
most of my friend feel the same way .
used to be an awesome shop for scale <UNK> .
great breading to the chicken .
but great looking decor only goes so far .
newer ford <UNK> call for <UNK> - 00 .
all excellent and well flavored .
good fast healthy food .
also their fresh homemade salsa can not be beat .
get here early or you will wait to eat .
one of my favorite mexican restaurants in arizona .
i always get their adovada ribs .
go with the onion rings .
this place was awesome .
"very poor service , if you ask me ."
"employees here are great , location is great ."
these guys are great .
broth was tasty plenty of garnishes .
. have been back twice had the # 00 .
. recommend it to a couple of friends .
it is simply the best buffet in town .
"however , the service is very low grade ."
maybe a new cook or something .
we are big on second chances .
<UNK> arrived at 0:00 pm .
service was pretty good .
i call this location .
management being the worst .
i / 0 rack of ribs with two sides .
bad meal # 0 .
bad meal # 0 .
good meal # 0 .
after the wings i did not order anything else .
bad meal # 0 .
she took if order and was very nice .
this is where we discuss the poor management .
it is no wonder the place was empty .
this is totally unacceptable .
started off with a <UNK> .
"moving company arrived and wanted 0,000 more than quoted ."
just really bad at what they do .
thanks for the final slap in the face elite .
visiting for a week on business .
their wings are ` ` alright ' ' .
dunno what was up with that .
best menudo in town .
i drive to work down broadway road every morning .
she ' s open at 0am sharp .
his quote was <UNK> competitive .
"i mean , wtf ?"
you will not leave hungry .
steve ' s a good guy .
his truck is practically a rolling hardware store .
"you know , i want to support my lbs ."
second - they are outrageously stingy .
they could n't possibly cost much .
the rest of them are inexperienced and dismissive .
the same woman i mentioned above was working again .
the <UNK> incident above is one .
"anyway , there are some good things worth mentioning ."
their selection of mountain and road bikes is okay .
there are a few guys there who are great .
joe easy is a good mechanic and nice guy .
"personally , i ' m sick of this place ."
this place is solid .
"super , super nice guy ."
"anyway , great business ."
mr flores is awesome imo .
"very , very , very good beer selection ."
nobody in town had what i needed except sun .
i go to this place every so often .
i ' m reviewing this taco shop .
the tacos here are bomb .
the fish tacos are particularly fresh and tasty .
the ground beef tacos are <UNK> good .
they act like ground beef is <UNK> or something .
"well , ground beef is not <UNK> ."
the food was fantastic .
yeah ... 00 dollars .
the pv is the ultimate dive bar .
it should get some sort of national award .
it ' s now 0: 00 pm .
this place deserves five stars for four major reasons .
i got four estimates .
the owner ' s name is wayne .
he ' s a super dude .
their menu is very simple .
"beef , or 0 ."
i recommend getting number 0 .
he only works on honda so he said no .
tait is the greatest mechanic in the world .
he ' s also an ac repair wizard .
tips for <UNK> - 0 .
the best burger i ' ve ever had .
my girlfriend ordered a martini as well .
i needed new rear struts .
they do a great job .
there are a couple of negatives .
"first , the prices are a little high ."
"second , the selection is a limited ."
because you wo n't be disappointed .
excellent delivery time and the meatball marinara was excellent !
the web site says <UNK> is a certified chef .
food is cooked to order .
both were very tasty .
the restaurant has been open only 0 months .
faster service would likely gain the fifth star .
the staff is very friendly and food is good .
the jt omelet is my favorite .
this place is wonderful .
"everything is outrageously priced , parking is ridiculous ."
beers were 0 bucks and you needed tickets .
one of the best car collections i have seen .
". seedy yes , cheap ."
. yes but its the low end of vegas .
seen a young kid win 0k here .
had a good time .
"first of all , the <UNK> is amazing ."
far better than at hookah <UNK> .
onto the not so good .
"overall , avoid it ."
but the owner in oakland is a jerk .
i found this bar / restaurant through a friend .
good spot for lunch when in summerlin .
i go there for lunch approx .
most recently i had the wonton pho .
the pizza here is great !
"fresh , tasty ingredients ... very well executed"
chris seemed to keep the crew organized and productive .
"sammy , our server was top notch ."
we had two rounds of design discussions .
"pricing was clear , itemized and above board ."
we ' re very happy with the end result .
"as i originally predicted , we have become regulars ."
quality and service remain top notch .
they were small but very good .
<UNK> <UNK> run this one .
out of ice at 0 pm who does that ?
company should be ashamed .
. so the pizza got cold .
"you want pizza , go elsewhere ."
highly recommended this place .
my order was perfect and in a timely fashion .
better than average espresso .
cappuccino a bit weak .
cake a bit dry but still tasty .
smoke everywhere in the elevators .
"nice atmosphere , generous portions and great service ."
nice atmosphere and friendly service .
the crepes were fantastic .
the hot salsa is simply the best .
christian and co are fantastic .
excellent american food with a twist .
ca n't recommend it highly enough .
would recommend number 0 .
best bbq i have had in las vegas .
the pork was perfectly smoked and tender .
or 00 % of the reservation value .
do n't use these people crooks & liars stay away
they really do it right .
i live in seven hills and they are downtown .
i wish this place nothing but the best .
maybe they should market a little better .
bad vibes thru out .
food was ok but not a craving like before .
service was very good and on time .
- lrb - with gas prices .
the place is dead during peak lunch .
i wish them well and hope they improve more .
ask for a napkin ?
ask for a napkin ?
they went from full service to barely self service .
this place does it right .
pizza is done in the traditional <UNK> way .
finally real mediterranean food in henderson .
this place is amazing .
wine selection is nothing to brag about .
btw : i asked where is chef marc ?
we really enjoyed this little henderson gem .
it came with an asian slaw ... very nice .
i highly recommend checking them out .
"outdated equipment , worn down and worn out ."
tried the ramen and it was just ok .
donuts are ok but they never have any .
the whole place just sucks .
the gyro took 00 minutes for them to make !
"needless to say , i kept walking ."
been a regular since they opened and will continue .
you must listen to this review .
food will make you severely sick .
the service was a joke .
service was ok but noting inviting .
high priced denny ' s .
no crap sausage crumbles in this place .
place is just not up to par .
all great and presented well .
"oh well , time to find a new wash ."
major major fail ! ! ambiance ?
they also give you a 00 % lvac discount .
"good job , great grubbing !"
$ 00 dollars for a dried out pumpkin cheesecake ?
just ok and not authentic bbq .
they store the food in <UNK> .
much better bbq other places .
i hear the owner is from <UNK> ny .
wow is he fooling the people in henderson .
i have the panang and it was superb .
the wine list is stellar .
give their place a shot .
. and i quote .
"everything was good , nothing blew me away ."
that is all i ask .
very nice new hotel .
the person prepping the sandwich skimped on ingredients .
same for a lot of the meat .
and a phenomenal view of the strip .
quality all the way through .
i ' ll be back for sure .
subpar would be an exaggeration .
we walked in and they asked us how many .
ordered pad thai with level 0 spiciness .
it is not oily and the taste is good .
the spiciness is just nice .
the taste is nice though .
"first , it is the miso soup ."
there are 0 types of sashimi .
the lady at the table is very annoying .
most people go there for the teppanyaki .
order the chicken mushroom with fried rice .
"as usual , i can not finish it ."
"anyhow , will go back and try other dishes ."
compared to other gyms ... it ' s trash .
- no paper towels in locker room .
advice : think twice about joining this gym .
experience : over 00 years of gyms .
super cool guys in there .
we ordered many dishes and shared them .
i had one with some exotic italian deli meat .
- they also have an asian foods section .
the service was excellent .
we received very little help in purchasing a bike .
opened the hood the oil cap was left off .
great service and good food .
a great place to have your auto needs met .
this is a decent airport .
went here thanks to numerous recommendations from other yelpers .
this pizza is okay .
i ' ve had much better steaks for less .
"cheap , effective way to navigate the strip ."
otherwise it ' s usually not overcrowded .
the hotel lived up to expectations .
so ... <UNK> by night - cambodian cuisine .
this review is for the cigar lounge .
this place has a knack for screwing up orders .
i do n't recommend .
seemed unlikely but that ' s what they said .
pastrami is much better .
it says comes with a fried egg .
but when i ordered it no fried egg .
try the burger place across the way instead .
try to avoid unless you ca n't avoid it .
just like i got in singapore .
"now , the awkward hostess and <UNK> time ."
a must do with kids in phoenix .
"huge , fun , full of variety ."
they were on fire .
the clams hold the meat were also good .
good fries too very friendly service and good food .
very good and fresh <UNK> .
good italian food but pricier than i anticipated .
asked for a royale med rare .
got it well done and cool to the touch .
what a fantastic show .
they have an impressive list of sandwiches .
the food was excellent .
the ahi was excellent .
one of the worst rental car experiences ever !
slow to nonexistent parking shuttles .
the absolute worst baggage handling times .
one of our worst hotel experiences ever .
it is quite old and outdated .
baked wings ... not too bad .
service ... pretty solid .
"fish tacos ... excellent , a real surprise ."
what more can you ask for ?
maybe at an attempt to avoid working .
they also serve <UNK> coffee with its smooth flavor .
my girlfriend loved the granola served oatmeal style .
the waitresses are all really friendly so that helps .
like a small <UNK> loaf stacked with meat .
decoration is pretty good .
also very tasty and recommended .
the dipping sauce made the sliders juicier .
my wife had the shrimp po ` boy .
nothing wrong with that .
we each had sandwiches that were excellent .
my wife had the oriental wraps .
she liked those as well .
that ' s all we need .
the special was a brisket sandwich .
my wife enjoyed the veggie melt with asian salad .
the prices were right for what you get .
now to the food .
we both had a combination of different enchiladas .
my wife had one spinach and one avocado .
i had one shredded pork and one shredded chicken .
the chicken was very bland .
top notch mexican food in las vegas .
great food at a great price .
that ' s all that needs to be said .
i cleaned them out and did n't say anything .
it ' s just your basic bud and coors .
without them i would have spent a fortune .
i ' ll be back here soon for sure .
he place is just superb .
diving board 00ft up in the air ?
check glitzy vegas surroundings ?
the foods was great but not for the money .
what ' s my saving ?
"with this irritation aside , the foods were good ."
i was surprised with a <UNK> nepalese section .
and i do n't consume east indian foods often .
the nepalese foods tasted like indian foods .
the service was plain ordinary .
it feels like a scam to benefit the restaurants .
groupon is a better deal here .
"diners , enjoy the vietnamese cuisine without going broke ."
the soup was soggy as a result .
but the rest of the foods items .
"to the point , it served just ordinary pho ."
this is las vegas .
the variety has been standard .
lots of fried foods for american .
"for tourists , it ' s las vegas ."
i ca n't even remember what i had .
so the selection was just <UNK> .
so i bought one each on the impulse .
so i bought one large loaf on the impulse .
and it was good and delicious .
extensively before hitting the buy button .
comparison can be deadly .
the blood sausage tasted like burned tired .
the shredded beef reminds me of sloppy joe .
it ' s ok for the taste .
the green plantains were like hard cardboard .
you should give it a try .
that ' s my problem with this restaurant .
i was told there was a compensation per day .
i returned the voucher way before the expired date .
nothing is new here about my bad experience .
and then the travelers can choose wisely .
flight was delayed in palm springs .
i missed the connection in phoenix .
i was a united premier member .
that ' s a wrong assumption .
not like united and continental .
the costumer service rep expressed indifference .
it has a totally different sentiment i assure you .
"after all , this is las vegas ."
"other chains have more selections , with higher prices ."
i purchased a groupon after yelping .
it ' s healthy for you .
my first overall impression was ok .
there were no vegetables except a bit of scallions .
the service was decent .
the bbq section looked good .
the cost was reasonable for phoenix .
i will give it a trial in the future .
but it ' s ordinary at best .
this was my last visit to any outback .
diner beware : it will go down under quickly .
the price was very decent for las vegas .
but at least they had desserts .
and it ' s typical hong kong taste .
the <UNK> had chinese sausage bits .
the portion was standard .
at a price of $ 0.00 each .
hope the quality will last a while .
you will get your money worth .
i went for <UNK> chow foods in full force .
nothing has changed much since last visit .
i still find the good value here .
the mango was real inside .
i did n't yelp .
i came here with one caucasian this time .
not a big deal .
dim sum selection was good .
but the foods were not hot on the <UNK> .
could it be the ac from a distance ?
i <UNK> ; d n't tell by the taste .
so comparison can be deadly .
i had an old review .
usually it ' s $ 00 each double occupancy .
the clerk was nice and helpful to some degrees .
i recommend checking out this place .
had a bad experience in downtown chain earlier .
the foods was consistent as expected .
no more no less .
the service was not very consistent during shift change .
the wait service was decent during a crowded hours .
i wonder if it will survive down there actually .
we had a good flow of cooked meats going .
just to be upfront here ... american expensive over-hyped .
but it ' s american <UNK> over-hyped foods .
so it was crowded with asian tourists .
so i ca n't really trash the foods here .
it started from $ 00.00 and up .
the appetizer was $ 0.00 and up .
lifestyle of the rich and famous ?
good food and service from owners .
heed the warning ... read this before booking .
the dollar bite size corned beef burger ... well .
not the best experience with the foods .
luckily i used mine at the chain in avondale .
it ' s very cold that night .
what a big rip off .
it ' s 00 times mark up .
the foods were ok at 0:00 am .
sky is not the limit on my value land .
"so diners , i have nothing else to add ."
it ' s not my first choice usually .
service can be spotty .
i usually gun for the water boiled dishes .
maybe they screwed it up in the kitchen .
the waiters have been reasonably attentive during most visits .
the appetizer never arrived .
not a big deal .
they were serving everybody else too .
i have had directv since mid 00 ' s .
wow ... it must be heaven sent .
but this is las vegas after all .
the cheapest main dishes here was $ 0.00 .
less disappointment that way .
average foods and service .
dim sum was meant to be eaten with friends .
it ' s plain outrageous .
this is for iphone users .
just does n't make sense .
"the burger was good , but very small ."
meat was tasty and loved the bread .
great variety and selection .
the lounge is very nice with 0 large televisions .
looking forward to the coffee house opening soon .
very overpriced and under flavored .
i may try it again in the future .
coffee refills took longer than it should .
the red chili was also very tasty .
old technology and a lot of problems .
the website is not very user friendly .
well things have gotten much better .
here ' s my assessment .
pros : great <UNK> and fried plantains .
yucca was mostly dry and flavorless .
would n't probably drive out here again from glendale .
first thing to address is the staff .
i ' ve been escorted in very quickly .
the pork loin was even kinda tasty .
"otherwise , a great lunch ."
prices are good for the most part .
staff seemed ready to help .
and it ' s worth the cost of admission .
"history came alive , though not literally ."
just great people doing great things .
a must if you ' ve never been .
chocolate pizza is kind of <UNK> .
what happened to the <UNK> valet ?
fine dining is about <UNK> .
i rest my case .
it is not circus circus .
"all white leather , <UNK> <UNK> ."
"busy , but way overpriced for what it is ."
nothing special or memorable about the steaks or sides .
not a <UNK> return destination .
"steak presentation one-of-a-kind , not to be missed ."
the beer is good and the prices are cheap !
another feather in the cap of the cactus league .
i watched a guy squirt ketchup on himself .
have been here a few times with my wife .
i ' ve been a patient for several years .
` ` 00 more plates of kobe beef please !
do you really need any more of an explanation ?
think of it like a tapas style japanese restaurant .
i am absolutely addicted to this place .
everything in kabuto is the finest you will find .
i left across the street to aloha kitchen .
the sashimi combo did not disappoint .
prepared well and tasted great .
friendly and courteous staff .
i ordered the ultimate ribeye and eggs .
good place to start a busy saturday .
got here on the second day of soft opening .
high tech menu board .
flavor was spot on .
"the owner , <UNK> , is a friend ."
"good luck , bro ."
got here on the second day of soft opening .
flavor was spot on .
"the owner , <UNK> , is a friend ."
"good luck , bro ."
my experience with scott was much different .
"not the sinks , toilets , tub , floors ."
can anyone shed some light on this for me ?
this forces you to focus on your senses .
the only issue was the restroom .
"i highly recommend , and would go again ."
the pita is pretty good .
excellent food and service .
the drinks are a ripoff .
thanks to jeff for his excellent and prompt service .
this place is awesome .
"all organic , locally sourced ."
had a macadamia paste latte which was incredible .
will be back for sure .
ribs and chicken were both perfectly seasoned and smoked .
expensive compared to the chain coffee shops in town .
free wifi is a plus .
good outside seating area .
"tiramisu was dry , bland , lacked coffee flavor ."
i gave this place two chances .
staff was very accommodating .
"for the price , 0 stars all the way ."
"after surgery , her room in icu was excellent ."
work is second space .
i never met a beer i did n't like .
some tvs around the place .
"did i mention , i am a pizza snob ?"
it was an <UNK> pizza slice .
i got a steak sandwich .
you ' ll find parking in the strip plaza .
restrooms are typically ok .
customer service is usually fast and efficient .
always fresh and hot when it comes out .
my favorite dish is the mongolian beef / chicken .
prices were typical for all you can eat .
i will not eat here again .
not too many tables to sit in .
great food and really good service .
the brisket is the best .
again - if in the area you must go .
as always great service and help from the staff .
as for service - 0 stars as always .
beer selection = decent .
also had the fried banana split .
would i go back - without question .
hope management realizes he is one of their best .
"decent furnishings , but room is dated ."
bath tub dated and appeared dirty .
i was only asked a few simple questions .
good seafood in the heart of phoenix !
"atmosphere is casual , especially during the day ."
all in all a very good experience both times .
the food is reasonably priced and always very fresh .
the decore is very inviting and well considered .
decent selection of beer on tap .
"sandwiches , homemade pickles , fries , tartar sauce ."
the place is clean and the staff is great .
this place is great .
it is what it is .
it ' s generally fairly quick and consistent service .
most of the food is typical sysco food .
this place is fantastic .
the sushi is also very good .
a very good place all around .
you wo n't go wrong here .
the food quality was generally very good to great .
the desserts were very good as well .
the bar is decent but only offers bottles .
not all restaurants carry the new breakfast menu .
arrived at <UNK> 00 minutes before they closed .
look for the flag on <UNK> .
the taco and <UNK> chicken were identical and flavorless .
no wonder this huge beautiful building is empty .
there was more staff standing around than patrons .
the bill was $ 00 bucks .
my wife enjoyed her tofu scrambler .
they gave him tripe .
the entrance fees are very high to this park .
the <UNK> are poor .
"ok , so its a tourist trap ."
im not trying to get my grill worked on .
"<UNK> teeth , even ol <UNK> in the front ."
"yea i name my teeth , what of it ."
nobody got time for that .
damn thats a drink at the cosmo .
thats a delicious port of subs sandwich and chips .
i mean damn it was a day late .
if you are broke do n't come here .
come here to be in awe .
three bucks cookie sandwich is a no brainer .
<UNK> bitch in the back busy doing laps .
peanut paradise looks like shit ditto on the cookies .
needs improvement to say the least .
"holly smokes , these guys came in handy ."
"water leaking , hvac dumping water everywhere , nightmare !"
contact these people you wont be disappointed .
took my wife there on saturday night .
amazing chicken fried steak .
and then another table .
went in a group of 0 out-of-towners .
that ' s the way to do it .
you just have to put it together yourself .
and all of that food was not terribly expensive .
this is a great value on the strip .
overall not a bad place .
i had the carolina burger with fried pickles .
make up your mind .
are you a dance club or a sushi bar ?
"and also , the employee that everyone complains about ?"
fine we get it .
i guess - what - as a warning ?
changed rooms multiple times due to maintenance .
on-site engineers could do nothing but call someone else .
and once inside you get lost in the atmosphere .
"staff is knowledgeable , and have great personalities ."
the best piano bar in vegas .
the decor is charming and whimsical yet classy .
. the list goes on - rrb - .
staff catering almost exclusively to the bottle service crowd ?
this club sucked last night .
overpriced cover and drinks .
ordered the adobada taco and a carne asada quesadilla .
the birria de res is arizona ' s best .
come here for authentic mexican food .
amazing view and good food equals a win win .
the menu here has improved gradually over the years .
place is always packed but worth the wait .
"the food : pretty good , actually ."
two words : huge calzones .
this place is good quality neighborhood italian food .
according to other reviews the bar is friendly .
pretty good deal really .
then added some green salads and fish tacos .
but the items on the menu were great .
ca n't wait to go here for dinner sometime .
the pasta and sauce was made from scratch .
this is not the case .
"tons of new bars , hang outs and restaurants ."
<UNK> - <UNK> is good .
the place is unique in every way .
"yes , they won an award ."
breakfast is killer and sure to minimize any hangover .
this place will keep you coming back !
"great food , but awful service ."
the wifi is even pretty fast .
this is where you need to take your car !
ca n't go wrong with the bean burrito !
"they are fast , friendly , and courteous ."
everything was completed in a day .
avoid this hertz at all costs .
had n't been to this place in 00 years .
"to be frank , this place is awesome ."
i would recommend this place 000 % .
"service , drinks , and chicken fajitas were excellent !"
this has happened two oil changes in a row ?

the staff : everyone there is awesome .
josh answered the phone and i explained my dilemma .
thanks dana bros for helping me out .
this place is a diamond in the rough .
the prices there are way too high .
the food is mediocre at best .
this is not a place i would recommend .
. the ingredients are organic and taste great .
i typically go to tryst in dessert ridge .
its a salad buffet ... thats it !
the service is fine but the food is blah .
i suggest you seek suggestions .
all over one bowl of pho wtf .
excellent comfort food at very pleasant family run restaurant .
the food arrived roughly 00 minutes after ordering .
"thus , no longer being considered a <UNK> ."
service last 0 times was poor .
wine was great and atmosphere is a 0 * .
great chicken shawarma & kebabs !
- rrb - four stars for that alone .

this place is awesome .

front desk service exceptional and personable .
over all a very satisfying experience .
"good fun , great time , really friendly staff ."
i was paired with david <UNK> .
these guys are the best !
these guys are great .
it all started with my initial call to katie .
the techs jim and ryan came right over .
very kind and professional .
the food was just awesome .
everything was outstanding good portions and great taste .
just do n't get the deli mustard .
i ' ll be back for sure .
food is usually excellent .
", , , ! ! , !"
you seem to have lost sight of your roots .
i would highly recommend this plumber .
there are a couple of trail options .
there is often an out of service moving sidewalk .
it is a dump .
had a multitude of sub-par experiences here .
do yourself a favor and do the same .
must try the corn and the assorted skewers .
instant favorite to take the wife on a date !
as good as it gets .
thank you <UNK> is a good guy !
overall the experience was good .
good luck and thanks for reading .
what do you do ?
literally every table around us .
i might want to try fine dining again sometime .
staff were friendly and the coffee was tasty .
you could ' ve had a $ <UNK> tip .
it ' s <UNK> a mix of both .
"however , is it worthwhile ?"
it was a <UNK> view and very romantic lighting .
they make your gambling experience twice as good .
i remember everyone ' s food was pretty good .
living up to it ' s hype ?
girls and guys will both enjoy shopping here .
"the downside , is probably the location ."
very new and contemporary .
great service and atmosphere .
staff is great and the food is really good .
the floor is good and the place is clean .
"almost nothing current , africa <UNK> , really ?"
0000 is not your target genre .
"no couple , blackout , or reverse skate ."
so much missed potential to include the customers .
price is high for what you get also .
' ' do n't these people work on tips ?
"yeah , stay the hell away from this place ."
not all ruth chris steakhouses are the same .
you order from a checklist menu .
this is one of those deals .
thanks again for the great hospitality .
i ' ll be sure to come back soon .
the place is late ' 00s chic .
hope this place survives .
that ' s cool if it is cut right .
this is a place that is great for kids .
but the bellagio did not disappoint .
the service was exceptionally attentive and surprisingly timely .
"my goodness , how often does that happen ?"
bellagio buffet is here to stay .
there were about seven returns and only one agent .
you need to beat out that breakfast rush .
"service was quick , friendly , and efficient ."
comp room for chinese new year weekend ?
$ 00 in slot or table games play ?
nice flat screen tv is new .
how ` bout that ?
nice going and i will be sure to return .
- rrb - what economic <UNK> ?
it hit the spot before the <UNK> fight .
and i will return again .
everything here is brand new and <UNK> .
all was served efficiently .
the service compensated for the average food and selection .
just remember to get your monies worth .
not a bad place .
music messed it up alittle though .
servers are ok but all over the place .
all in all not bad .
at least i think .
i guess its what you make it .
but the bread is literally death .
had a pulled pork sandwich .
"conclusion , not a bad place ."
food was as good as mcdonald ' s gets .
james is a great guy !
the horrible experience did not end there .
everything was then served together .
the <UNK> of cops against all is real !
everything else on the menu has always been great .
"love the sandwiches , hate the price ."
so i gave it a try .
"overall pricy , but very good ."
a great experience and i look forward to returning .
great old town atmosphere .
it was a perfect match .
three of us for dinner .
the crave burger was good .
the crust was burnt as was the asparagus .
"good steakhouse , but not great or excellent !"
so in comes lawry ' s .
another 0 star occassion and venue .
a definite cut above your normal steakhouse !
is bomb stuff ... .
they offered him a line of credit for it .
i asked about the interest rate .
they said it was 00 % .
not on the monthly bills .
this place is as bad as payday loan sharks .
this place is the <UNK> .
the mod was the most <UNK> of them all .
<UNK> frills ... just the best .
0.0 food restaurant floor run by amateurs .
real noisy if you ' re stuck inside .
the ingredients are excellent ... carefully picked and prepared .
. that is the same .
save your money or go to denny ' s .
. well prepared and with excellent ingredients .
this cuisine is prepared carefully and with excellent ingredients .
"inside is nice , not many people inside ."
almost $ 000 for a standard main drain snake .
almost $ 000 for any other drains .
repeat this several times on big problem drains .
wild thaiger is in the heart of uptown phoenix .
central and thomas area .
cool little restaurant with a nice atmosphere inside .
food is great and very fresh .
this place is <UNK> 0 <UNK> y ' all .
almost $ 000 for a standard main drain snake .

the concessions here move surprisingly quick .
stopped in to get some fuel and water .
i just had the most phenomenal pizza here .
very good service as well .
i will definitely try them out again .
friendly service and a great cup of joe !
not a customer friendly restaurant .
had to wait 00 mins for bill .
. same kind of response from the staff .
there ' s also a fleming ' s steakhouse .
imagine if this was eaten while sober ?
justin is probably just being a tool .
"great place , great staff , great product ."
they tried to get me to upgrade twice .
then said come back in 00mins .
really enjoyed my garage door repair !
i have to agree as i snuck a taste .
their wine selection is extensive and quite impressive .

"p . s . desert , not so good ."
overall there is potential .
then took a while to get a menu .
they were also out of asada for asada tacos .
overall the food was excellent .
food deserves at least a 0 .
"but again , the overall restaurant experience is important ."
the idea was better than the execution .
it is basically meat on an open toasted bread .
"now , moving to the must try ."
small baby corn each covered in mayo and chilly .
the <UNK> <UNK> is also a must try .
"ask for the pig , not the slop ."
"now , if you want to try something different ."
dumpy places sometimes make great food .
hopefully before the apocalypse .

this place has an amazingly tasty burger .
this is a great breakfast place .

the tuna and salmon were particularly fresh and tasty .
the soft shell crab was done to perfection .

good place to go .
then saw my friend and sat at open machine .
i put some money in it .
then we played other machines .
i thought i won a raffle or something .
i had no idea what he was talking about .
i thought the steak needed more flavor .
"ok , not great ."
long line to check in all friday night .
0 hour wait to get room keys .
elevators slow and hot as a sauna .
then 00 minutes to get car from valet .
the fries were quite good .
freshly cut and seasoned .
the food and service is both great .
this one is a winner indeed .
they make a mean milkshake for starters .
"first , the food quality is indeed good ."
i tried the ultimate tuna and was mildly impressed .
their sichuan food is also worth trying .
the atmosphere is okay and the service is acceptable .
"anyway , give this place a try ."
the server was prompt and provided the specials .
their beer selection is impressive to say the least .
i call it : <UNK> .
the server was courteous and apologized for the problems .
the best bar on campus .
absolute worst drip coffee on the planet .
my wife was a patient here .
all delivered from an uncaring staff .
their criteria clearly does not include quality of care .
the answer is a lot .
the smith center should consider such a limit .
after 00 minutes we left without ever being served .
the creamed spinach was like eating <UNK> .
the salad was sour .
you feel hurt and the <UNK> was weak .
first and last resort experience .
the rooms run about 000 - ish a night .
crust was flavorless and limp .
oven not hot enough .
ingredients diversity was not also available .
great concept poor execution .
i am very satisfied to their service .
nice staff and place .
nice little pub downtown .
"not the typical pub food , way more eatable ."
"my room was better that expected , mostly clean ."
feels a little bit like a concentration camp .
"plenty of dishes , nothing extraordinary but all decent ."
the restaurant gradually filled up to capacity .
the meat was less than awesome .
but overall diner was excellent .
i recommend even if it is kinda expensive .
oh well feel free to read my reviews .
they <UNK> my favourite restaurant .
it ' s now line up and pay .
ces the busiest time of the year .
"bad , bad service will never go there again ."
lunch is good but the dinner meals are excellent .
wf failed to deliver .
distrito should change the name to <UNK> .
the music is well performed excellent song choices .
both of those things hurt the experience .
this is the only car wash i go to .
why not install <UNK> on the taps ?
on a final note : the communication was terrible .
these should be stands .
the staff is fantastic and the food is fast .
order a salad and other items for take out .
the plus is no gambling in the hotel .
one word of advice have locks on your luggage .
it was cool valet was free .
overall it was so-so .
will never return to this location .
"wow , i really dislike <UNK> ."
- slowest tsa staff ever .
- a shuttle to my terminal ?
- absolute circus in the baggage claim area .
this hotel / casino is rediculous .
what more could i ask for ?
. my money that i lost playing bj .
. is this not invasion of privacy ?
the incident is now under investigation .
. with 0 of them working .
a handful of <UNK> ... including us .
a couple friends ordered zen noodles .
i ' m a fan .
"but , a new waitress hooked us up ."
. it was all hell from then on .
comps : the wynn is really generous with comps .
"dealers : talkative , charismatic , and offers advice ."
i ca n't play with stiff dealers .
"chanel , lv , dior , <UNK> , rolex ."
<UNK> showroom also to the right .
outdoor patio straight ahead .
i opted for a heineken .
the cheeseburger was very bland .
. and of course the heineken .
price : $ 00 for the burger .
dal toro did not impress me at all .
* $ 00 admission for showroom .
i guess these guys do n't want the business .
you ca n't go wrong .
the rooms are comfortable and clean .
excellent location and the wait staff was very attentive .
it does n't get much better than that .
this place has the trifecta .
my only gripe was the cost of the food .
fair trade coffee has great mochas .
"if you are pretentious , stay away ."
this place is for real people .
do n't use this dominos .
they are charging 0.00 for parmesan cheese .
and they claim to have no napkins .
please note that i was not asking for extra .
twice for lunch and once for dinner .
good things : pretty good <UNK> here .
people were friendly and the steaks were excellent .
other choices can be had for a little less .
the food and service were excellent .
flavor was among the best i ' ve had .
they were all <UNK> examples of classical preparations .
local ingredients are used wherever possible .
"best steak in town , who knew ?"
the korean dishes were authentic and very well done .
all of the dishes are authentic home-style louisiana fare .
i ' ve already had numerous issues .
they receive the signal each time .
the waiter was the son of the owner .
hiro sushi serves only the freshest fish available .
the best gumbo in phoenix !
"however , that is probably a good thing ."
very pleasant team of people to work with .
you will never hesitate to refer them to anybody .
just do n't listen to any of their pitches .
<UNK> hut at does not stand behind their products .
beer is pretty good .
here is the issue .
beer and a burger = an hour .
do n't own a grill ?
"to be truthful , i was expecting greatness ."
grimaldi ' s pizza was simply average .
"well , its not too good either ."
that is just poor on every level .
problem four : i ordered the smothered burrito .
"overall , a place to avoid ."
a gym is a gym for the most part .
"weights , cardio , etc . ."
it also <UNK> on atmosphere .
i mean that respectfully .
"food was decent , service was terrible ."
here is why this group is the best .
it also feels good to support a small business .
"give em a call , ask for barry !"
this is a really great place .
overall a pretty great thai restaurant !
great hole-in-the-wall 00hr diner .
they are not too good on custom work .
the curried vegetable soups was thick and tasty .
my wife had grilled salmon that was surprisingly moist .
the food is average .

this place is much better then i expected .
you can see the cooks preparing the food .
the food looks good .
the transitions in absinthe are great and very enjoyable .
you wont be disappointed .
i cant wait to see it again .
which in turn resulted in the 0 hour wait .
my only complaint would be in the deserts .

it is definitely worth the wait though .
highly recommend everyone tries this place out .
i mainly enjoyed the carved meats .
i of which we very good .
its like watching the insane running the <UNK> .
the food was exceptional .
service was notably great .
the place was slow so there was no excuse .

i ' ll be back week after week .
the employees here are always polite .
food is cooked well .
to put it simply ... this place sucks !
how do you screw up breakfast ?
what ' s the point .
attitude is everything and it starts at the top .
the fries are crispy and you get plenty .
i get all my morning joe there .
not much more to say .
great beef bowl and ramen here .
the low price makes sense given the mediocre pizza .
what could be more fun than shooting zombies ?
i went in with a group of six .
no other place felt nearly as comfortable .
"one round , the other with the heart stone ."
here is the brief rundown of my experience .

the <UNK> were also broad and deep .
"the food ... well , it was mixed ."
the bread was awesome .
"the dish was , well , ok ."
kinda bland but passable .
"i had a steak waiting for me , right ?"
a peppercorn new york steak with red onion compote .

"great food , good people ."
this place is overrated .
i really enjoyed the mango lassi however .
this place is terrible .
they were good and had the tastes i expected .
the flavors they have are splendid .

it met all my expectations for buffet indian food .
the food was mediocre with some good in it .
it has a very simple elegance to the interior .
service : i enjoyed the frequent coffee refills .
it looks like the hotel was <UNK> to perfection .
flat screen tv and good choice of channel selections .
it was rather non traditional for a nye party .

i picked up some stuff and a book .
this is a review for the restaurant .
"do n't fight the wave , just ride it ."
the wait was only about 00 minutes .
so it beats chevy ' s from my perspective .
"- rrb - , the food ."
"almond milk shakes , homemade lemon and <UNK> ."
it ' s very clean and orderly .
so we returned to the aloft the next night .

0 - rrb - in line for 00 minutes .
those are likely better options .
bilingual and very friendly service .
the burger is tender and cooked perfectly .
do not use this cleaner .
avoid like the plague !
the waiters explained the dishes in detail .
arrive right at opening to avoid long lines .
"karma is real , alive and well ."
<UNK> an amazing city to get wasted in .
you will not understand <UNK> .
"just go with the flow , <UNK> ?"
. in hindsight it seems obvious .
found this place while living in henderson .

shut them the hell up !
only place in the area open past 00pm .

maybe they had trouble finding the can opener .

the cost is $ 00 like every other place .
not a fan since i do n't carry any .
probably wo n't be back because of that reason .
"other than that , good place ."
burger was not as juicy as other places .
it ' s all done from a reclining couch .
saw the reviews and they all looked great .
the place has big rooms and clean .

the meals were expertly prepared .
my wife and i have been here several times .

they are not that special .
the food was only fair .
traditional american style food .
the pepperoni they use is a really good brand .
the sauce was ok .
i ' m willing to give it another shot .
low mediocre at best .
the food was ordered from grubhub .

they could not provide the room i had requested .

"from then on , service was exceptional ."
it was quite good .

everything was good except the crust .
the other ingredients and flavors were all great !
ajs crust had expired for me .

not nearly enough for the money .
not a far walk from the marriott .

the experience is always the same : top notch .

wish this state had an alamo <UNK> .
the hype for this place is ridiculous .

no excuse for crappy service .
steaks were sub par and incorrectly cooked .
i heard the wall mart on <UNK> is better .
the lunch spread was awesome especially at $ 00.00 .
everything served in these tiny small stainless steel pots .
they had almost everything except dim sum .
especially to see what they have for dinner .
being the poor <UNK> that i am .
for happy hour this place is awesome .
it was a pleasure definitely .
. better be hungry when you go .
0/ 00 ... go steelers .

not spending my money at a place like that .
not cool at all .
the pizza is pretty good .
seasoned with black pepper ... oh man .
picking up was a snap .
kind of tasted the freezer burn .
especially the ` ` no personality pit boss .
' ' i guess i am <UNK> .
the ambiance is superb .
it feels like you are in a tropical location .
outside seating is scarce and no reservations are allowed .
the caribbean theme is a nice touch .
fits the location well .
grilled chicken breast sandwich - was a hit .
"this place is no frills , simple menu ."
burgers and a handful of other options .
they are known for the brulee burger .
the concept is interesting .
the place was filthy though .
"fun , double check ."
but is the # 0 in the us .
a small pie is enough to feed 0 .
location shares space with other dining establishments .
friendly tsa staff ... abundant at that .
drinks were limited to one <UNK> vending machine .
the casino floor did n't impress me .
nothing really stood out .
maybe i am onto something .
this a gnc and vitamin shoppe in one .
there are several in az . .
nothing really different than other locations .
plenty of restaurants and bars nearby .
super safe area as well .
all their locations are fantastic .
"great reviews , good menu and a hip vibe ."
my wife liked it though .
atmosphere - loud and modern .
"service - good , no complaints ."

hands down best mexican in town .
this is at about 00:00 pm .
they were still doing sound check .
the coleslaw was a nice compliment to the sandwich .
it can get a bit chaotic siting inside .
"- rrb - , chicken and deep fried eel ."
"prices are fair , and staff are very nice ."
there was 0 clerks working .
first and last time ordering from this establishment .
that was my perception .
saw this hotel online with lowest rate for sat .
"great service , great result ."
"still , was a nice touch when it was ."
cons : parking can be an issue .
some wear is evident in the place .
they all seem to be this way .
quiet to the point of being empty .
<UNK> icecream in multiple varieties is a nice touch .
it has a somewhat dingy look to it .
"a few things to note , however ."
' ' and things of that nature .
same goes with the check .
the crowds at city center in general were light .
i would give this place a shot .
and go to <UNK> ' s next door .

very nice - - but noisy - - place .
we decided to split the 00 ounce porterhouse .
the sides were very nice and complimented the meal .
' ' ` ` no blender anywhere ?

the service was very good .
the food is the standout here .

i also could n't pass up on the <UNK> !
bought an 00 mini cooper in april 0000 .
this place is great .

well after hesitation they ordered and loved their meals .
great prices and huge plates of great food .
i do n't see myself staying here again .
room was ok in size but nothing in it .
easily sat our table of 0 adults .
any breakfast <UNK> would feed two .
the lengua tacos are waaaaay over cooked .
sashimi was fresh and a good value .
would of liked a bigger japanese beer selection .
inferior to nyc pastrami ?
"short line , great food , and awesome coffee ."
actually the only place for any ny sporting event .
or spinatos on bell .
definitely good people and very entertaining .
streaks and missed areas .
dont waste your time .
delicious place for lunch .

this place is fantastic .
hot bread to start with a fantastic carrot spread .
you wo n't be disappointed .
crab legs - pretty good .
salad bar area - pathetic .
"where was i , <UNK> ?"
this place is good .
"sausages , bacon , hash browns were all good ."
some kind of world record sandwich maker back there .
scene <UNK> was the ciabatta bread .
no <UNK> - they used boiled chicken .
"that being said , it was pretty good ."
all the meats were nicely flavored and tender .
the bottled sauces on the counter were unnecessary .
$ 00 each is n't bad .
the food is average quality and selection here .
free circus shows every few minutes .
nice theatre in a ghetto hotel .
nice stadium seating but not much <UNK> .

"the service was decent , but not great ."
the prices were reasonable enough considering the portion sizes .
but the food quality ... all win .
"good god , the jalapeno bacon was incredible ."
but on to what ' s important .
the jalapeno pale has been talked about extensively .
it ' s a decent for a novelty beer .
". or beer , as it is ."
taste and seasoning is kinda bland .
probably location and price in comparison to other options .
i would definitely consider this a hipster joint .
it was excellent and quite a large portion .
the aioli that is served with it is excellent .
no excuse for 00.00 crown and coke .
"beers are in line , although poor selection ."
"no craft beer , lose a star ."
piano players are above average .
it should be illegal its so good .

this place never gets it right .
it was also a little on the small side .
"nothing blew me away , but nothing disappointed either ."
desserts were good but not great .
i ' d give l'atelier 0.0 stars .
<UNK> is n't like either of these .
that charm is lacking in <UNK> .
dining is another problem .

"all-in-all , the food gets a solid 0 stars ."
"the service , however , is their weak point ."
service was n't their strong suit either .

modern without being pretentious .
try the <UNK> mans platter ... fantastic .
will definitely be a regular stop .
the pizza has always been good .
"i liked the lamb chops , and roasts ."
lobster barely warm more on the cold side .
maybe it is obvious but we didnt know .
all other restaurants in the area were booked up .
the service was excellent and the food was good .
"jay , the service manager was a lifesaver today !"
do ask for a chimichanga enchilada style .
they get minus 0 star for mediocre rice .
i also like about the big nice pool there .
it ' s more like a fast food restaurant .
the staff was busy but remained courteous .
"they have 0 different sauces , all unique ."
went there today for the 0st time .
the concept is great .
they a <UNK> debit cards now which is great .
"yeah , it ' s cramped a little ."
chips and fresh and endless .
i love the gringo <UNK> .
i ' ve been there about a dozen times .
the beer in the venue was $ 0.00 .
just a little disorganized .
i think this place is great .
"the food is terrific , the staff is great ."
"but , the decor is old ."
slow but great work .
these guys know their keys !
these guys helped me every time .
solid local independent pizza place .

go eat at <UNK> .
"they ' re the best part , imho ."
the bread was kinda tough .
they had 0 chances .
"but , thank you for the good work ."
could n't recommend a better place to <UNK> .
not out of this world but what i expected .
the burgers looked really good .
the indian place in town .
"okay , lets do this !"
the gumbo was amazing .
"but who cares , fuck chips !"
"cheap prices , great food , laid back atmosphere ."
this makes no sense .
that is a very shady business practice .
here i am on day 00 and still sick .
i have been going here for years .
the woman couldnt give me a price .
todays service was a 00 minute <UNK> for money .
great beef bbq sandwich !
"pulled pork was good , not great ."
cole slaw : top notch .
buns for sandwiches are marginal at best .
"bready bagels , not real bagels ."
0.00 and up for nigiri .
hard to relax with that $ hit <UNK> away .
"bottom line : expensive , and only mediocre ."
try sushi kee on warner / rural .
"great beer , good food ."
since just after they opened up .
the difference in service is incredible .
not necessarily in that order .
<UNK> seemed to be the call .
<UNK> closes at 0 from what i recall .
the quality of food was good albeit pricey .
lots of <UNK> going on there .
in summary : pros - good food and service .
food and drinks pricey .
pools need temperature help .
still paying for that even today .
both my wife and i ordered the fillet mignon .
we requested a certain table .
still no contact from lost and found .
still no contact from management .
everyone will be hearing about this .
there has been no concern handling my issue .
apparently repeat business is n't important in this industry ?
the pizza is great .
and almost all of the bartenders are great .
"hey <UNK> , this is n't the jersey shore ."
"so , bottom line , would go i back ?"
it could be my casa away from my casa .
the sides were really tasty as well .
"pay the price , and enjoy it ."
food quality was really poor .
would not recommend to a friend .
chef <UNK> sanchez is a true culinary magician .
i would rather dine at le cirque than <UNK> .
they exist for one reason and one reason only .
to get you fucked up .
you have to park around the back .
they do n't serve food .
they serve drinks and that is it .
they pour em strong and they pour em cheap .
mine was passable hers was too sweet .
oh well easy come easy go right ?
"various pastas and pizzas , etc . ."
this was not one of them .
excellent tacos and their homemade salsa is the best .
' ' or ` ` holy shit !
next let ' s move on to the food .
before you even get the main course .
you know who you are people .
i will call a spade a spade .
maybe 0 or 0 tables were occupied .
' ' what the fuck is that about ?
then comes the entrees .

good move on my part .
well this is one of those places .
i strongly suggest that you go check it out .
efficient is how id describe this place .
the service was competent and friendly .
i have zero negative to say .

my girlfriend and i left stuffed as can be .
great variety and very friendly staff .
"and most importantly , great beer !"
the miso soup was basically just salt water .
ching <UNK> ching <UNK> ching <UNK> .

he keeps it simple using highest quality ingredients .
puck ' s pizzas meet that standard .
that is value if you know any better .
nice views but not the best .
"challenging course , well maintained ."
"nice range , spacious putting and chipping greens ."
groupon buy @user 00 $ was a score .
this isnt cheap but nothing is in vegas .
theater was 00 % empty .
"but mark my words , he wont last ."
dont burn your time in vegas .
great service by chad .
the crusted pork was salty .
a good part of the strip .
john ' s voice still very solid .
accompanying musicians world class .
great place for a fine vegas lunch .
the honey roasted peanuts in that salad ... great .
turkey club is superb .
wife loved her salmon and baked sweet potato .
bad meal or experience ?
does le burger deliver a pretty good burger ?
nice tight 00-00 minute set .
far cheaper than cirque and better .
"a very , very funny guy ."
amazing burger & meatball sandwich .
<UNK> club was solid .
00 $ for meatball burger and fries .
exquisite and creative cafe food and a premium price .
pulled pork sandwich is quite simply extraordinary .
best entertainment value on the strip .
this is in no way a 0 star show .
great voice with range .
this show has potential .
0 steaks with pommes frittes .
the choices are immense .
0 italian premium cold cuts .
these are smaller tapas and pricey .
but quality of ingredients is first rate .
high end presentation and plating .
friendly and warm service at the bar by david .
steak sandwich with side .
it is how you handle the crap that matters .
michael took great care of us .
"for entrees , i did what i never do ."
al dente high quality pasta .
i wanted to lick the sauce off the plate .
here is the great service part .
im a restaurant owner from chicago .
here is the funny part .
my wife and i laughed a lot .
his takes on the nuances of sex were hilarious .
also 00 times <UNK> than dice .
creative plating and presentation .
the server was dry as hell .
you have to walk down escalator to use washroom .
lobby is as classy as any .
quality people stay and gamble at caesars .
drink service like all casinos slow .
0 pools to choose from .
poker room best for tourists on strip .
isolated from smoke and slots .
seasoned dealers with good array of games .
that shows me he cares .
great food options because of forum <UNK> .
they make a good one here .
thats not the problem .
the problem here is the food is weak .
from portion to presentation to flavor .
the menu and offerings see little change .
the sauce was excellent .
buffets in general stink .
variety here is weak .
salad station non <UNK> .
great affordable option in the venetian .
next to the canal .
flavor is way above average .
by far best of the chain steakhouses .
we were wasted but it was great .
but the real star is the smores flatbread dessert .
cocktails were solid and cappuccinos were served piping hot .
good for your prestige .
cant make it your dinner .
and no one does salad better than puck .
finally tried the meatloaf ... wow .
the buffalo wing lollipops .
"a friendly visit by executive chef , eric klein ."
spago is what makes vegas special .
another quick trip to vegas .
another stop @user spago .
"another top notch , no complaint experience ."
god dam is it good .
as usual service was great .
"prompt and helpful , but not smothering ."
my number 0 place in vegas .
wife enjoyed the curry shrimp .
superior service by james .
best <UNK> pizza in the business still .
easier said than done .
we drank at the bar twice here .
peter is one of las vegas ' s best .
fixes great cocktails and <UNK> well without getting obnoxious .
we tried the prime beef sliders ... awesome .
"both , extraordinary flavor ."
"00 years later , place still is packed ."
. we basically lived here on this trip .
the turkey club here is out of this world .
i will be back with the wife in may .
"btw , lamb chops were amazing ."
sorry but that is weak .
yet make no mistake .
the food is still great .
the hong kong <UNK> salmon was excellent .
the pie had too much cheese on it imo .
generally they need to have limited sauce and cheese .
this bartender was solid .
the short <UNK> gm has scowl on his face .
the pizza wasnt cooked well done as asked .
the cuban style sandwich for lunch was excellent .
the prime beef sliders .
chicago tom is long gone .
"james , is gone ."
needs to be <UNK> up .
spago needs a breath of fresh air .
cocktails and service at bar were stellar .
this is an extraordinary experience from start to end .
high energy world class entertainment .
the staff was very friendly .
we both felt the food was pretty bland .
"over priced , but decent food ."
probably wont go back again .
"fair pricing , and great attitude in the shop ."
food is great and has really good beer specials .
these cheeses are world class .
also the fish <UNK> is the best in town .
only tried the original stromboli which was excellent .
expectations not as high as this is pub food .
the food was very good .
everything is over priced there .
the staff seemed <UNK> and somewhat aloof .
"but over time , it has changed ."
this happened multiple times .
<UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> .
the food here is really good .
the staff was always cool as well .
"best of all , its open 00/0 ."
exceptional food and service .
starter ravioli <UNK> alone is worth trying .
steaks are fantastic as are the sides .
even the coffee presentation and breads are fantastic .
the special was the tootsie ' s bird special .
the soup was very good .
it was delivered within a 0/0 an hour .
food was very good .
god bless this guy !
i will recommend <UNK> from now on .
i will certainly be coming back for more .
one of those people is a <UNK> guy .
its so this guy can charge you for pictures .
your not <UNK> do that but <UNK> this place .
"nice people , great food !"
keep up the good work !
there was an impressive assortment of vinyl for sale !
but check it out .
the sound quality and visuals are crisp .
this place is all right .
good with the nachos et <UNK> .
next was jack daniels .
". like , several choices are on special ."
you can also probably be slightly disappointed here .
what does the lamb say ?
"not much , i ate its tongue ."
what does the lamb think ?
"not much , i ate its brain ."
cause they got it .
knowing what congestion lay ahead of us .
somewhat strange and drab in there .
"lots of <UNK> , amber , copper <UNK> ."
the seating area was cool .
but <UNK> just did n't wow me .
others have mentioned the miniscule nature of the dishes .
"the chili cheese fries were pretty epic , though ."
"the opposite of a red robin , say ."
"i went with a bone-in new york , medium-rare ."
it was cooked expertly .
but i was rewarded .
food usually comes real quick .
"yes , it looks bad from the outside ."
suck it up and give it a try .
fun atmosphere and staff .
the beers are strong and cold .
a good sandwich to be had .
"for what it is , it works ."
"cheap beers , nice <UNK> , and interesting clientele ."
"the best steak in phoenix , bar none ."
here ' s the thing .
family <UNK> story is a great plus .
the cons : inattentive waiter .
"never heard of , similar to <UNK> ?"
everything i had was outstanding .
we would be given a double queen .
"not much else really matters , right ?"
"honest , nice , helpful ."
not the worst way to spend a monday morning .
the bruschetta was unreal .
the food is phenomenal .
i highly recommend az repair .
try pho 00 right next door instead .
unsurprisingly our $ 00 does n't cover the bill .
the rooms are comfortable .
"look , the place is what it is ."
strong signal that worked well .
the lady serving made you feel welcome immediately .
looking forward to coming back in the future .
"this trip , as others was a pleasant evening ."
great salsa and nice fresh chips .
<UNK> old church building .
decent food for a decent price .
building is somewhat run-down .
and liability is no joke .
". very interesting , no ?"
went there since it is a pittsburgh tradition .
the organization of space was pretty good .
highly recommended and high expectations for shows to come .
we had a four cheese pizza .
i had pork ramen and it was delicious .
the environment was loud in general .
but the sevice was decent at best .
"casey , kiki , neil ... ."
the bar is also really good .
the food was excellent as well .
this place is good .
also has the <UNK> of crafty beers !
beer is the specialty .
' ' what else has changed ?
where temps reach the hundred teens .
the sausages are perfect here !
this wendy ' s drive through is open late .
i can not requisite ever going there again .
this rating is based largely on the beer .
this beer is excellent .
all of the beers are excellent .
they do however have an excellent menu .
cheapest meal you can get on mill !
this is the place .
either way it was not anything special .
"if it is busy though , do n't wait ."
also they used to be t c <UNK> .
has no other locations 0000 miles away from mexico .
its ok to adventure out of what you know !
this place is better than the mill store though .
it tells you what is in the awesome sandwiches .
or just get the special .
the specials are excellent .
short leash does it right .
these guys improved on the hot dog bun !
"the best part , this mountain <UNK> paradise valley ."
the richest part of phoenix .
it would be too poorly executed to exist .
will you stop eating crap just because of nostalgia ?
this place is awesome .
best turkey sausage i ' ve ever had .
"you get your own drinks , silverware and condiments ."
i very rarely find anything here that i like .
the food here is good .
the guinness pours are good .
good whiskey selection ... noticing a trend ?
this place has the greatest sauce in the valley .
there is a lot of turnover .
this overpriced cafeteria really needs to figure itself out .
its got <UNK> ... just not value .
not a shitty mp0 player one either .
"nonetheless , it is a dive ."
overall this place is great .
i ' d just avoid it in the evening .
the staff was chaotic .
there was also no list of beers .
the wine had a similar issue .
it felt like i was in the southeast !
"you pick up and pay him , super easy ."
old school <UNK> repair .
so this is worse .
"bob , knock those damn barriers down !"
have you ever had a <UNK> ?
"from the outside , i was unsure ."
the draft selection is phenomenal !
i was blown away at some of the choices .
but no chicken is rough !
<UNK> is the real deal record shop !
the food is excellent though .
this place is upgraded to five stars !
this place was ok to bad .
perhaps that is their solution to the rope issue ?
i have been there 0 times .
next was $ 0 burger monday .
this place apparently has an awesome drink selection .
i do n't really know or care .
i am a beer drinker .
"furthermore , a frosty glass <UNK> beer ."
a place that does have them ... c'mon .
why not just have bud / miller / coors ?
- rrb - and it was indeed excellent .
"if you are near and hungry , stop in !"
they have chicken cutlets .
i mean even <UNK> pizza has that available .
"cool spot , bike rack right outside ."
there are two main issues that annoy me .
the food was excellent .
although as i leave the tempe <UNK> .
that was an isolated incident though .
its made the palette grow wiser if anything .
"nonetheless , sacks makes ridiculously good sandwiches ."
this really is a nice ball park .
the old smoking area sucked !
i ' ve been here a number of times .
"the dogs are ok , just nothing special ."
those hot dogs were worse than circle k dogs .
that implies they are pre-made .
this is a denny ' s .
the cooks here are pretty good .
it had the requisite accoutrements of a theater .
the food is macayo ' s level .
let ' s get this straight .
the ice cream was excellent .
that was fine as that was all we desired .
the pictures i have seen also show glassware .
the night was 0/0 / 00 .
the ice cream was excellent .
this place looks awesome .
"the food , well it is not that great ."
just no real delivery of something worthwhile .
"fine , two reasons to hate it ."
hanny ' s is rather exceptional .
"great drinks , great food and very interesting decor ."
great ingredients make great pizza and sandwiches .
drive through is slowest ever .
that spot was a go to place .
eastern european sausage is their specialty .
"indeed , they are for horse stuff ."
as well as many different farm animals and pets .
"well , most of the time good sushi ."
this is family style eating at its finest .
go and enjoy <UNK> ' s .
they had a beer menu with domestics and imports .
they really do not do brunch well .
get the damn <UNK> off your street too !
$ 0 for a crappy breakfast burrito .
i have had better burritos from a frozen wrapper .
they pretty much own the place though .
the bartenders and waits are pretty good .
"neighborhood bar , great to visit ."
the replacement was expensive .
would n't last 0 minutes in ny .
this place <UNK> the pizza .
this place is a cool idea .
"only , its like subway for pitas ."
never had a bad time .
this place is alright .
"kitschy name , fine food ."
did n't hooters already bark this tree out ?
. having evolved as an omnivore - rrb - .
this is a great sports bar .
"food is good , fine bar food ."
expect good bar food .
nice pool table and great tv set up .
"mexican barbecue , as good as it gets !"
i have never seen a staff member unhappy .
the tubs raise and lower !
the service and management are absolutely atrocious .
so this is a brewery .
matt ' s is pretty good breakfast .
this place is definitely a sports bar .
the food is pretty good and reasonably priced .
two pet peeves : they have no bike rack .
burger king down the block has ' em !
the smallest is medium now .
the smallest drink is a medium .
staff is cool and courteous .
this place is all right .
i do n't care about accoutrements like that .
"very old school , vintage appeal ."
this is a real mexican restaurant .
just plain old excellent mexican food .
which they make there .
the food is pretty good .
the fries are awful .
also the teenage staff makes the experience no better !
this place is awesome !
they really pay attention to detail .
easily the best bar food menu around .
"i finally did brunch here , it is awesome ."
someone knows what they are doing .
this place consistently kicks out quality food that satisfies .
the chuck box is a barbecue .
they are the best burger in the valley .
get a chicken sandwich with pineapples .
which totally blows but is probably better for them .
finally i gave it a try .
what you get for $ 00 .
"burger is okay , not great but not bad ."
in n out level ?
as good as lobby ' s up the street ?
the 0oz burger for $ 0 is almost insulting .
this is in the same category as habit burger .
"menu : massive menu , a bit overwhelming ."
they knocked it out of the park .
"if you do n't , steer clear ."
both were quite good .
their chicken sandwich is quite good too .
this place gets great reviews for a reason .
i ca n't stop getting their burgers .
i challenge anyone to find me a better burger .
that ' s authentic right ?
it really had the texture of egg whites .
the daikon kimchi was the only solid side .
it blows this place away on all levels .
one is a spider roll .
this place was lazy .
they fall into the do not return category .
"not good , not awful ."
"went expecting exceptional , not underwhelming ."
"if you struggle finding good sushi , keep looking ."
this one is the best around .
the staff and owners are very friendly as well .
she told me that their italian beef was popular .
that is when the experience went down hill .
"i got a replacement one , hold the juice ."
they screwed up pizza and the hot dog .
"our meals were very good , just as expected ."
pretty good chance you ' ll like it .
very helpful and knowledgeable staff .
have i taken them back and made a stink ?
not many places have them that small .
service has always been good .
the food is actually quite good .
their jameson grilled wings are great .
great sonoran hot dogs .
very helpful and once again a great meal .
greasy and limp enough to need a fold .
i think it is 00 ' ' or so .
the place is very big inside and always clean .
but for a quick slice ?
the fries are below average .
it certainly is n't high quality .
it certainly is n't any good .
i have lived here for nearly 00 years .
most places in az are a dime a dozen .
i have been here 00 + times .
this is my base for top notch sushi .
do not hesitate to try new things .
even back east that is a rarity .
great fresh fish is not cheap .
not to mention the great yelp deal i got .
this place lacks even mediocre customer service .
memo to dobson ranch .
it is always very moist and tasty .
keep in mind they smoke all of their meats .
it will taste like smoke .
it was a solid meal with good portions .
"overall , nothing spectacular but still a decent experience ."
the rest of the experience was similar .
the rest of the food experience was average .
service at the bar was good .
why do you go to moreno ' s ?
the gf had the chicken dish with polenta .
this places rating is for real .
everything about this place was great .
the food : reviews speak for themselves .
this guy is a <UNK> .
would be under $ 00 with just the meals .
that is what you need .
the tikka <UNK> fries were very good .
another negative is nearly everything is fried .
not even pretending to be competitive .
they sell smoothies if you are into that .
that is a bad sign .
the entire menu was fair game .
either way it was very good .
they should serve this by the pitcher .
"fresh bread , and meat and veggies ."
what more can you ask ?
"for the price , the wine is n't bad ."
sure does n't say that anywhere either .
pretty much everything about my meal was poor .
they were not that good .
at least they did n't screw that part up .
if you want decent food i suggest looking elsewhere .
you will not have a bad meal .
hopefully there are enough people to support it .
it was all very tasty .
very helpful and friendly staff .
this is just another diamond in the rough .
this place has been dead every time i go .
apparently my honda is not baller enough for them .
this place is great for the beer lovers .
the building is unique and quite large .
it was all very tasty .
the gf had the gnocchi with added goat cheese .
this place blew us away in all aspects .
best gyro in town imo .
it better be spinning before i get it .
both were very good .
it was actually very good .
the place was clean and the staff was friendly .
the yelp deal dropped that down considerably .
"meat is moist , and everything has good flavor ."
they were tender and the sauce was good .
just a few <UNK> and that ' s it .
extras go to a good cause as well .
"the concept is awesome , the execution is average ."
there is zero effort on getting the goods locally .
they admit to buying from grocery store <UNK> .
"with the proper expectations , you will be satisfied ."
they have a nice selection of indian beers .
their tandoori is surprisingly moist and is very tasty .
nobody judges a place based on the buffet .
what are you people smoking ?
"yeah , that will round out the dish ."
what kind of seafood joint serves you shredded fish ?
is it marlin or tuna ?
why the hell would i want my fish shredded ?
"it was either canned , or just not fresh ."
why are they adding frozen veggies to the rice ?
it was a choice between sea bass or tilapia .
it is an unbelievable little place .
"businesses <UNK> , and homes are replaced with <UNK> ."
why do they get minus a star ?
the place is very casual with some personality too .
"great food , friendly and social staff ."
what more do you want ?
the plain sushi was decent .
"not the best , not the worst ."
most were in the $ 00 range .
<UNK> deserves two 0 star ratings .
most of the offerings are pitas filled with deliciousness .
i had the curry goat which was decent .
that will be a problem once it gets warmer .
- 0 0 - with popularity comes the morons .
too bad because it has <UNK> potential .
this place is in rough shape .
my dog held his nose walking by these people .
someone as trendy as you should know that .
the obvious answer was no .
service was solid too .
all very tasty and quite rich .
this has inserted itself into heavy rotation .
the most recent experience was highly underwhelming .
not a spec of seasoning .
"it is breakfast , the cheapest ingredients out there ."
the nachos are a meal in itself .
the food always comes out quick though .
this place is the best hot dog joint around .
i always leave satisfied .
<UNK> was as underwhelming as it gets .
patrons are very loud .
no points for not screwing that up .
out came the sides and the dishes .
most were very bland while others were just bad .
"overall , the place was really bad ."
"was n't great , was n't bad ."
it was a very satisfying meal .
"first of all , the food is good ."
it ' s really quite good .
great bring your own wine .
especially compared to the other restaurants in the area .
it does bring the neighbourhood a well deserved <UNK> .
he certainly gave this restaurant a better image .
the food was rich .
a sure bet for a good time .
just what the doctor ordered .
and everyone that works here is a professional .
that ' s quite rare .
the terrasse is great .
a must for meat lovers .
the service is courteous and efficient for a tavern .
"ok , overall i really like <UNK> a lot !"
there are a few employees that are great .
i ' ve been coming here for 0-0 years .
it shows in the way his <UNK> are trained .
you guys probably saw it on the news .
"holy <UNK> , batman !"
that received a quick <UNK> of ` ` damn !
yet another ` ` damn .
camelback mountain rocks ... no pun intended .
aight <UNK> and players here ' s the <UNK> .
can you dig it ?
the parking spaces themselves are substantially larger .
' ' he then demanded my lunch money .
the other snakes laughed .
"at any rate , they took care of me ."
i actually enjoyed this part .
went there last night for the first time .
my daughter loved the garlic knots .
food was pretty good .
the restaurant is rad .
the place was good and the food was tasty .
overall : great food and sauces .
it was an okay experience .
the large pizza is huge .
this is a great restaurant that everyone can enjoy .
comfortable atmosphere yet enjoyable .
in las vegas ' s edition of china town .
say hi to bruce .
been there many times for lunch and cocktails .
rooftop terrace is really nice .
"literally , you could n't see what was underneath ."
you wo n't be disappointed .
these people are flaky .
do n't give them your money .
i had the know poblano burger .
does anyone in the kitchen have basic culinary training ?
this is <UNK> stuff .
"also , the place was hot ."
the fries are a constant issue .
the answer is that i should n't .
give me independent theaters any day of the week .
you ' ll be pleasantly surprised .
' ' would the food fit the atmosphere ?
cousin vinny serves up some good italian .
shady ' s has shown me a new path .
just sloppy all around .
i never have issues when the veterans are working .
my main was the duck meatloaf .
it was out of this world .
why is this place deserving of such buzz ?
"<UNK> , <UNK> bad for the price point ."
"rocket burger , i shall return ."
<UNK> is a mediocre venue .
what more do you need ?
my family ate at mi pueblo for lunch .
"the decor was , well , who cares ?"
the food is the thing .
and the food is good .
mi pueblo has all of these things .
the ordering system is strange .
it gets hot as hell in the summer .
it started bad and <UNK> into worst ever .
the mechanic team was also easy-going and friendly .
when the hell are you coming to ny .
"the food itself is frankly stated , a disgrace !"
as to the service or lack thereof .
no manager per se was seen or noted .
"c'mon amex , get your act together here !"
not worth the effort !
the flat bread / pita was tasty .
still allows cigars in the bar .
excellent service both times i have been here .
i had the nom nom burger and it rocked !
it ' s worth if my burger bucket list .
"less expensive , better tasting food ."

cool space in a typically <UNK> az strip mall .
the food is excellent as are the espresso drinks .
the food is very good .
the service was very good .
the double dragon roll was exceptional .
the only down side was the price .

sad to hear they discontinued that service .

a simple yet well done dish .
the wine selection was fine .
the folks here are extremely polite and professional .
apparently a pittsburgh tradition .
the service by the counter help was atrocious .
fish servings was skimpy .
this was expected so no big deal .

seven employees standing around talking to one another ?

"food was adequate , margaritas better than average ."
is it the best fried chicken in the south ?
my fault - - not theirs .

what do you do ?
it ' s like a jungle in here .
there ' s also plenty of seating as well .
they attract big name djs .
dance floor and two upper levels .
great bottle deals on their industry nights .

why not come and help your business thrive .
been over 00 years .

best is its in walking distance from my house .

"service was great , fast and helpful ."
i ordered a basic cheeseburger with seasoned fries .
very tasty and worth the price .
i ordered the cheesesteak sandwich with homemade chips .
truly a mess to eat and confusing at best .
open a yelp account just for this review .
the chili cheese fries were good too .
all in all it was affordable good food .
the one up side was the food portions .
pints next door at lunch time are $ 0 .
the price was high and the portions were small .
sometimes old faithful just does n't cut it .
been here 00 + times .
the crust has just the right chew and crisp .
our fourth visit and consistently good restaurant .

this is a below average sports bar .
much better than filiberto ' s .
"great service , reasonable prices and awesome food ."

nothing here is special .
what makes it special is it is inside vegas .
vegas can do better .

the dishes were plated nicely in shallow <UNK> .
the staff is very friendly and efficient .

", old man - rrb - has deep pockets ."
we ordered a second basket of bread .
entrees range from $ 00 to $ 00 .

just better attention would help a lot .
we got two free drinks at the casino bar .
lorraine at the front desk was great .
very nice at check in .
pros : room was clean .

"service was good , nice people ."
"the burritos tasted ok , not highly recommended ."
the shake was n't very good .
we just came in on the 00th ' ' .
i ordered the green chili burger .
this time i got the italian sub mikes way .
not complaints and i like this location .
the food is good .
the steaks off the menu are okay .
the sides are amazing .
if i was the mgr .
i love there roast beef .
are not all sushi rolls made fresh i asked ?
they take too long to make your sushi .
they seemed short handed .
it does n't get any better though .
the decor is a little dated .
i will recommend them to others .
so far the place looks old and smells old .
waitress was very friendly .
this place is consistently good .
my wife loved them .
best service i had at a gay night club .
good - the $ 00 meatballs were amazing .
"the <UNK> , classy cleverly designed ."
amazing experience ! ! ! nothing like this place .
the <UNK> and <UNK> mixed .
the <UNK> on a plate .
this place really deserves 00 stars .
i ' ll be back for the beef wellington !
this place is a dream .
it becomes the standard you expect from all restaurants .
course after course of exquisite food .
you can view the innovation menu online .
the food was outstanding .
caviar with frozen pea mousse .
a0 wagyu with some sort of savory sponge cake .
lobster with smoked butter <UNK> .
the cheese course was a treat .
i simply mentioned it and <UNK> it happened .
it is fine dining .
not the typical french <UNK> .
service was genuine not faux .
be sure your rent is paid in advance .
completely worth navigating the cramped parking lot .
i recomend the one with pork and mint .
"well , look no further ."
"not the wagyu version , the base version ."
i always picked the toyota .
i ' ll list my most recent experience .
i had a $ 00 resort credit to use .
now here are some bad things people will say .
- it ' s a little expensive .
"guess what , who cares ?"
the staff here likes to have fun .
this is not l'atelier de <UNK> « l robuchon .
disclaimer : i dislike / <UNK> musicals .
overpriced food in an airport terminal ?
crappy pizza with horrible toppings ?
this pizza is terrible .
not too bad of an idea from the owners .
it has alot of shops and alot of employees .
so why two stars ?
the shit tsa employees .
it ' s a mistake !
' ' the food here was great .
the deserts here were awesome .
i ' ll definitely return .
this place if full of win .
so why the 0 - stars ?
i recommend to all .
i always stop in for the feast buffet .
the gambling there is <UNK> for me .
do your self a favor and pop in .
an overpriced circus show with water .
"yes , that is what this is ."
' ' so what did i do ?
it makes the really funny into die hard laughter .
there was no laughter this time .
<UNK> is luke ' s father ?
this show pales in comparison to it .
great place for a cheap drink .
"why , thank you sir may i have another ?"
$ 0.00 steak special please ... yum yum .
- do you like mediocre food ?
- do you like crummy service ?
- do you like high prices ?
are you a <UNK> ?
why do you hate america ?
the desert selections during the weekend brunch were great .
toasted blt rang up for about $ 0 .
the blt was a solid value .
<UNK> gem in downtown .
one of my new favorites in downtown las vegas .
you will be severely let down .
the only only <UNK> good thing about this place .
"even then , it gets one star ."
a few reasons for it .
"the atmosphere , the prices and the serving sizes ."
the drinks were expensive but strong .
i recommend this place though for atmosphere .
i like green valley ranch .
the wings were good and the mojitos were excellent .
the buffet at bellagio ... .
"average : sushi / rolls , mac and cheese ."
"yuck : <UNK> , veal piccata ."
went here once again over super bowl weekend .
you ' ll be coming back for more .
not in a good way either .
good place to watch the game and very comfy .
sure ... let me cover it .
the room itself was average .
got ta love 0 elevators operating at a time .
sign up for the comp club ?
food in this place ?
the cheap gambling and decent drinks are worth it .
"anyways , back to the review ."
stop in if you ' re on boulder highway .
this place is nasty .
"sure , why not ?"
the terminal they are in is old .
the service here is terrible .
i do n't have any van <UNK> <UNK> .
"hell , go to wendy ' s next door ."
this is the deuce .
deuce is a term for two .
"wow , this is a nice sports book ."
did n't see a drink waitress a single time .
only 00/0 odds for the <UNK> ?
"in short , this airport stinks ."
i am not putting this on a grading curve .
this buffet is average .
the food is fresh and edible .
the selection is alright .
pro ' s : - price .
the place is actually well designed .
the selection is n't bellagio or wynn like .
cons : - service .
the pizza here is average .
that ' s not a good thing .
at least it ' s not imperial palace !
i paid $ 0.00 for lunch here on day .
i went back for thirds and <UNK> .
$ 00.00 prime rib special = value .
"easily accessible , clean , some good rental agencies ."
get a $ 00 rental from enterprise ?
the service here is terrible .
' ' that is what this is .
the city is like a plastic <UNK> .
they have better lines than mgm resorts <UNK> do .
i tip the dealers .
nobody on the table did but myself .
there is potential for five stars though .
- good vibe from everyone .
- good selection of <UNK> and shops .
the bad : - dumb mini-bar staff .
this was taken care of immediately .
from sunday to wednesday it was empty .
$ $ $ $ - crowded pool .
do not rely on taxis .
how many operate at a time ?
maybe three or four if you ' re lucky .
some small fixes could get it to five .
which is room 000 on the 00th floor .
"not a good value , but very delicious ."
the gambling part is another factor .
"so , no blackjack here for brian ."
the dealers were lukewarm and decent i suppose .
mgm grand is a nice hotel / casino .
one woman and two men .
chicken bacon ranch pizza is amazing .
the stuffed style meat pizza is amazing .
or at least modestly well ?
the waitress was clueless to the menu items .
loved this place originally .
nothing really stood out .
everything here is good and at a reasonable price .
i like the suggested mixes on the board .
there was a definite leak around the vent stack .
i recognized this immediately as a threat .
there are better companies out there .
what a joke service .
"all in all , this is a great place ."
michael came out initially to <UNK> .
everything was very good and very filling .
i would recommend to anybody that likes greek food .
this place is ok .
the meatballs were flavorless .
the cheesesteak was bland as well .
the wings are good too .
i ' m gon na order some right now .
i am big a fan of both crust styles .
in at least two cities that i know of !
this is a solid lunch choice .
both were excellent but the salad was top notch .
the hazelnut coffee here is very good too .
great mom and pop hawaiian joint .
these are the best wings in town .
pizza is good too .
ca n't beat $ 0 drafts and free pizza .
my favorite restaurant in phoenix .
especially when they have crawfish or oysters on special .
waiting sucks but the food is worth it .
"very good , quick and cheap ."
sushi ... fast food style .
good enough for me .
so that is where i am now .
so no internet = no bueno .
chang lee deserves some love .
give them a shot !
the store is well lit and clean .
clean plates and silverware .
i enjoy the chicken at el pollo loco .
my family stopped in shortly before dinner .
great lunch specials for 0 - 0 bucks .
everything came out quick and hot .
the coffee drinks are great as are the beers .
for a buffet this place is pretty decent .
i will try this place again .
just wish they were open later .
this is a nice mom and pop type restaurant .
both were very good .
everything i have had at greek wraps is good .
they have ace on tap .
thats good enough for me .
fortunately i also dig the food .
"best mexican food in the valley , hands down ."
cool change from typical chains .
not sure how these places have survived .
this was several years ago .
"anyway , i am glad i eventually went in ."
very outside the box approach to old town scottsdale .
all i can say is wow !
the attention to detail in the place is amazing .
both added a nice energy to the experience .
"very friendly staff , made me feel very welcome ."
highly recommend always a good time at <UNK> .
. where all over the place .
i have done tons of business with these guys .
"volume was great , conversation was easy ."
finally a unique concept in old town scottsdale !
the internet manager knows nothing .
i recommend staying away .
the used nissan i bought had many hidden issues .
do n't make the same mistake i did .
maybe that ' s normal here ?
we did not order custom creations .
"the other person ordered fruit , bacon and potatoes ."
got food poisoning here .
not nearly as good as coco rico or <UNK> .
and a tremendous value on price as well .
well staffed and well <UNK> of the area .
not very courteous at all .
great selection of underwear ... great staff .

clean in the restrooms and in the dining area .
for a chain restaurant i was pretty impressed .
overpriced denny ' s basically .
pretty average italian food .
the pasta and the marinara sauce were absolutely average .
not really a memorable or exceptional spot .

increased <UNK> drainage may spread the tumor .
the people there now always seem lost and confused .
dyson vacuums are an example .
it ' s like a consumers <UNK> effect .
usually when i go there i order the filet .
i truly hope management takes this into consideration .
the food is well above average airport fare .
. towels rock hard .
not had that problem before anywhere .

big fan of ru sans .
prices are not that great .
prime beef and dry-aged cuts will set you back .
clt airport is a mess with all the construction .
but the real value comes from the service .
"not bad , not bad ."
"like i said , bellagio ."
it appeals to the masses .
go if you are hungry and need asian food .

out of convenience we chose tender .
that was a mistake .
the salads were pretty unimaginative across the table .
i ordered the beef strip steak .

nothing out of the ordinary or memorable .
this is one of them .

turns out it was this place .
the car was also completely empty on fuel .
00 miles later the check engine light comes on .
i call the salesman and he ignores my calls .
which they say is the problem .
i doubt this guy even owned the car .
i would eat here again for that reason alone .
after finishing my pie alone i was stuffed .
tl ; dr this place is awesome .
i consider myself a sandwich expert .
first off the serving was micro small .
really a rip off for what you get .

all i can say is wow !

"excellent burger and mac n cheese , enough said ."
"of course not , what was i thinking ?"
fresh mussels and oysters ?
treat this show as a pg - 00 movie .
this place is it .
the portion was enough to fill my tummy up !

the overall service was exceptional with one minor hiccup .

typical indian fare with nothing especially good or bad .
the food was very good .
i had the venison which was very tasty .

the prices are incredible .
definitely worth around $ 00 .
there is always access to the main dance floor .
"decor : modern , nice , and clean ."
all looks and no substance .
this is a good place to go to chill .

the chili was surprisingly light for chili .
not crazy like the strip .
this is one grimy hotel and casino .
pros : 0 - rrb - great location .
0 - rrb - prices are relatively reasonable .
feels like the <UNK> of a college party .
0 - rrb - casino is pretty small .
0 - rrb - rooms are poorly decorated .

only half shot of alcohol .
the format was quite interesting .

everything they do here is out of control .
"excessive gambling , drinking , and partying ."
food : $ 00.00 for all-you-can-eat sushi dinner .

0 - rrb - middle level - main floor .

one word sums this place up ... avoid !
the salsa is good but too hot .
lunch time food is actually pretty good too .
what ' s the deal ?

decor : 0/0 - nothing special .
- rrb - ceiling with a bunch of people .
the place gets loud quickly .

i go here one a week .
very good sushi for a very good price .
great place for sushi and <UNK> - period .
grimaldi ' s could use a small price adjustment .
normal place ... prices are so-so compared to dicks .
food : quality and flavor is good .
"it is average , at best ."
i ' ve been going here many years .
"the food is always very , very good ."
top quality and tasty dishes .
portions are very small for the prices .
for the price it is high quality .
"it is thin crust , which is my preference ."
totally average quality and taste ... over-priced chain .
i do n't go here by my own choice .
one of my favorite places to eat for dinner .
all the dishes are very good to superb .
"if not , you are not missing anything ."
i go here about 0-0 times a year .
love the pastrami and corned beef !
"service is excellent , food is always top notch ."
i ' ve had nearly everything on the menu .
done buying those from them .
barely average fast food quality and taste .
had a nice yelp event there .
"chop was perfect , nothing more to say there ."
totally unimpressed with the steaks .
way too lean and tough .
quality & flavors were excellent .
. <UNK> was the least impressive .
reminded me of a <UNK> don & charlies .
food selection on terminal 0 b gates suck .
come on phx mgmt ... remove head from rear .
i refuse to buy that swill .
for airport food this one is pretty good .
randy is a great guy .
now the beans ... very good blend .
"the place is low-end , like denny ' s ."
"cool place , very good food ."
prices are a bit high for what you get .
excellent food but pricy .
this place is good .
but the rack of lamb was perfect .
looking forward to my next visit .
"costco , so yeah , great place ."
so the food ... very good .
"plus , you can get a reasonably health meal ."
overall this place has above average food .
we had nearly everything on the darn menu .
be warned ... this place is very expensive .
the deserts were meh .
good variety of games and activities .
"beer here is great , no surprise ."
next time i ' ll stick to the burger .
i explain below the entire meal .
"duck two ways was good , not great ."
desert was the <UNK> <UNK> - excellent .
great coffee ... very nice people .
the flavor was a bit lacking .
"they were below average , at best ."
they did provide some nice greens when i asked .
then he made the two drinks .
plus you get the added benefit of eating healthy .
- lrb - plus they serve wine & beer .
then there ' s the mac choices .
nice deck and dining area .
of course ... but not the point .
i have done this before .
dollar for dollar the best deals in las vegas !
"if susie is serving that day , request her ."
the bacon martini is no joke .
the first time i ordered the philly .
you wo n't regret it .
not much going on .
these guys really serve up a quality product .
the sausage as previously mentioned is huge .
just the sandwich is good for me .
- lrb - are they co-op buying that stuff ?
i just want the sausage .
i spent 0 years in service .
you are officially put on notice <UNK> .
<UNK> taco needs an intervention ... .
0 tacos 0 sides & a drink .
let me explain why .
here again : ` ` really ... <UNK> ?
the 0 star experience is post first friday .
expect a 00-00 minute wait to get in .
the sauces are pretty amazing from my 0 experiences .
just the wings is $ 0 cheaper .
"oh well , ces ' t la vie ."
rating this place is almost unfair .
first off ... i have an ayce fetish .
"fried alligator , which was served in nugget form ."
it ' s a complicated business concept i know .
i do n't tend to seek it out .
but this place really does it for me .
he <UNK> himself to each table .
"they have 0 different menus , chinese and american ."
they do n't have a great beer selection .
$ 0 pitchers of domestic beer .
' ' no big deal .
but this guy came close .
what else do you want .
tom colicchio ... job well done .
especially considering i was starving when i ate here .
as others have said the service is kinda slow .
this is the iconic in-n-out of vegas .
the view ca n't be beat though .
mostly $ 0 tables and penny slots .
this place is amazing .
rio and paris are way better .
. but the service was bad .
the beer list is what really shines here .
for example the <UNK> they ca n't change .
this place is amazing .
this place is amazing .
very high end food and high end service .
"simply put , fresh , simple , and delicious ."
$ 0 meatloaf with mashed potatoes for example .
matzo ball soup was ` ` terrible ' ' .
jimmy johns is <UNK> as they advertise .
they make some good subs and always deliver quick .
excellent food and service .
authentic italian with dishes to satisfy any palate .
do n't be fooled by location .
great place to entertain customers !
went for dinner ayce about $ 00 a person .
every one was nice and sincere there and helpful .
five stars all the way !
she talked me out of orange juice wtf .
one star for the loaded no chili hotdog .
wonderful selection and friendly staff .
this cafe in the beautiful tivoli village exceeds expectations .
do not go here if you want authentic .
many many options for shakes and juices .
only a few customer there .
what do they just attempt to heat your food .
"thanks guys , you rock !"
"thanks guys , you rock !"
each time i come here i try something new .
what a positive attitude and inviting demeanor .
do n't be fooled by the outside .
either up the performance or lower the price .
"however , the food taste was mediocre at best ."
if restaurant management ever reads this .
i got the supreme and a primo meat .
great coffee house with food selections and wifi .
it ' s easily $ 00 / person there .
the prices here ate also very reasonable .
i ' ve been there probably 00 times now .
the special combination runs a very reasonable $ 0 .
i came here for the ayce .
my minced pork barely filled half the bowl .
in a japanese restaurant ?
i called to ask if they buy swords .
the prices here are also very reasonable .
very fair prices and a nice atmosphere .
the service was cordial and quick and not pushy .
the ravioli with our requested white sauce tasted phenomenal .
keep up the good work !
"great room , got the terrace suite ."
thats a whole other story ... .
the smoked meat and brisket was great .
ordered enough to make multiple sandwiches .
great and friendly staff .
provided us with a list of recommended places .
place looks small though .
good service and atmosphere and accomodated our large group .
otherwise craft and in house brews tasted great .
took 00 minutes to bring 0 bowls of pho .
otherwise the monte carlo potatoes was great .
as was everything else besides the steaks .
<UNK> tacos all around .
waitress real nice bar and kitchen staff totally approachable .
fantastic menu and preparation .
friendly and extremely knowledgeable staff .
"<UNK> , <UNK> , and unethical ."
worst buffet ive been to on the strip .
waited an hour and a half to be seated .
running low on food in a buffet .
but not 00 bucks hilarious .
this is no five star hotel buffet .
seafood section just sucked ass .
the best part was probably the seafood !
among the best joints in the city .
until it takes over 00 minutes to get them .
so hope next time is better .
get the pig ' s head .
new redesign is cool .
this place has a great 0000 vibe .
"unfortunately , it ' s over a decade later ."
"overall , update or die , guys ."
pretty much sums up the place .
puts traditional chinese food to shame !
so take that as what you will .
my kids think the pizza is great .
meals are cheap and food is ok .
place is nicely decorated .
other pasta items are excellent !
i go there for the superior service .
highly original and diverse menu options .
always an excellent meal .
wife had the hawaiian french toast .
decent price and food was excellent .
by far one of the best .
awesome on a hot humid summer day .
great service and the bar fair is quite excellent .
very good thai food .
service as good food was above average .
for about the same price .
awesome place to take the kids .
food is above average .
awesome selection of beer .
best burgers hands down .
really pretty and classy small neighborhood italian place .
had the short rib osso bucco .
but i would still prefer it was veal .
wife had gnocchi and very pleased very good homemade .
and very very cheap japanese !
in fact quite good .
incredible atmosphere very upscale and beautiful restaurant .
i had a <UNK> special of the day .
it was a lamb shank <UNK> in yogurt .
fresh spring rolls and fried egg rolls are excellent .
they were excellent quality expertly shucked .
then tried the maryland style crab cakes .
chef was entertaining and very good .
love their spicy habanero bbq sauce .
food was quite good also .
sushi menu was quite varied for a steak house .
a bit upper class type of mexican cuisine .
walks up and <UNK> issue <UNK> .
sip at a time & tip at a time .
horrible service by night crew .
"clean rooms , comfortable beds , flat screen tv ."
"i highly , highly recommend cher ' s concert !"
"well , that was disappointing ."
this is an extremely poor rendition of a gastropub .
air vents are filthy .
contacted their ` customer care ' and got nothing .
great job and great service .
i highly recommend the green corn tamales .
great biscuits and gravy sandwiches .
way overpriced for what it is .
"good coffee , breakfast and lunch options ."
really good burgers and a cool concept .
their truffle fries are top notch .
this place is a gem .
"outstanding quality food , drinks , and service ."
"good food , great service , cool ambiance ."
best enchiladas i ' ve ever had .
their ribs are especially delicious .
nice selection of specialty rolls .
stopped in for breakfast on 0/00 / 0000 .
this place is awesome .
service was on point and very helpful .
nice atmosphere very chill .
stopped here out of the blue .
"awesome staff , awesome food , good prices ."
"well , coke , not pepsi ."
ca n't say enough bad things about this place .
the car was outstanding as well .
flying buffalo pizza - buffalo wings on a pizza .
only thing here i would avoid are the wraps .
hard to beat this kind of value .
look no further than <UNK> .
pamela ' s hotcakes are a masterpiece .
the lyonnaise potatoes are also something to marvel at .
that ' s where the money is .
a pretty diverse selection for brunch .
"overall , a very good buffet ."
recommended both by yelp and my vegas junkie friends .
the food here is pretty decent .
the choices were limited and average at best .
"now , upgrade the wifi !"
but for my money the venetian is the best .
there is no choking clouds of smoke everywhere .
and that is why i will be going back .
it is good but nor great .
another coal fired oven pizza .
"and guess what , this hit the mark ."
tried the cannolis and they are not bad either .
went to the wicked spoon to try it out .
holy crap is it good .
that is when things kind of went south .
i am a big fan of pawn stars .
"was the 00th person in line , no problem ."
avoid this place at all costs .
the design is ok but somehow very standard .
and this one is certainly not .
service is below acceptable .
"as a frequent flyer , i avoid this airport ."
typical mishaps for a poorly managed airport .
i will certainly be back soon !
staff is extremely polite and knowledgeable .
great selection of flavors and high quality vapor supplies .
the staff is great .
i would recommend to anyone with or without insurance .
dave ' s knowledge and customer service is unmatched .
good selection but <UNK> are waaaay over priced .
my advice is to pass on this spot .
"great selection of meat , cheese and wine ."
i ordered the buffalo chicken wings and ribs tips .
"good <UNK> food , not the best but cheap ."
salmon was actually pretty good .
wasted 00 dollars on a really crappy car wash .
had an awesome stay .
all the holes were very basic .
seemed awkward how it was all open .
good beer and liquor selection .
pick 0-00 drinks and do those well .
it was all excellent .
what more could a guy want ? ! !
i would come here again just for steak night .
other stuff like health care .
another las vegas buffet which means another expensive .
"both times , i got great views ."
been here a few times .
nothing special at this <UNK> .
do n't forget to tip the bar tender .
not much gourmet selection which is okay with me .
great mac and cheese though .
the layout stands out .
"they closed early , earlier than most <UNK> places ."
if this was connected or inside a casino .
went last summer to see the show .
it ' s more about class than getting full .
they have a roller coaster too .
the only one on the strip .
<UNK> closed down and stratosphere is far away .
not your typical malls you see everyday .
also they have many dining options .
none of them are cheap .
planet hollywood would be cheapest dining option here .
price should be lower for the size .
it ' s bigger than advertised .
location is good but not great .
so you got ta find them .
either you get seated very far and close .
food selection is good .
prices age very good .
. prices seem good .
mostly every visitor pays a visit for this walgreens .
this is probably the busiest walgreens in las vegas .
i prefer it over cvs across the street .
however i do n't mind going to cvs .
anything lower than 0 stars is blasphemy .
many screens for the betting screens and tvs .
good place to stay .
this casino is n't bad at all .
you would think it ' s a video arcade .
the best buffet in downtown .
not as big as the strip buffets nor exotic .
two food courts is a plus .
"other than that , nothing special ."
prices are good for a hotel restaurant .
food is okay though .
meals are average price for a mall .
review is for the casino only .
the casino looks very nice .
it crowded all the time .
loads of tourists here of course .
update : the <UNK> goes straight here .
other than that not much change .
a good place to check out .
this just like any other mall in the usa .
closes early too compare to other malls in vegas .
it usually plays the same music everytime .
now it ' s just like any other place .
first time eating since 0000 .
many come here for that .
that was a motel fail .
been here a couple of times .
the food is overpriced and not all that .
in n out has better burgers .
ca n't go wrong here .
short story : a fairly small airport .
"holy cow , that was a big steak ."
"the service , decor , and ambiance was spectacular ."
the raw oysters were amazing as was the asparagus .
long story : last meal before leaving vegas .
"the shrimp were butterflied , battered and deep fried ."
a great experience in all .
worst credit card i ' ve owned to date .
this place is awesome .
the food was high quality and amazing .
thanks for showing us your true colors .
stumbled upon this while walking the strip .
i rate them twice as good as purple penguin .
"service was good , nothing really special about it ."
skip it and visit brio ' s instead .
good food good but not great .
beer selection was off the hook .
owner was lost when i asked him ?
' s but the barkeep knew his stuff .
wished they sold growlers .
i be there once a week .
less expensive than an hour at the card table .
* nice bathroom soaps / shampoos .
i ' m glad i was an early <UNK> .
this was a very frustrating experience .
i just joined yelp solely to share this .
i had the 0lb burger which was awesome !
these guys really turned on the rock & roll !
the place is not only great .
there is a definite problem with the hospitality staff .
the staff was nice but not exactly intelligent .
"better options elsewhere , wo n't be returning ."
"both were delicious , absolutely outstanding quality ."
it ' s worth every single cent .
i would n't recommend the bento / combo box .
it ' s somewhat small / lacking in variety .
. very dangerous with ground beef .
a burger joint that does n't <UNK> real fries ?
my wife and i had reservations there last night .
parking was an issue .
service was the high point of the visit .
we ' ve found them to be incredibly addictive .
"excellent food , attentive service , very reasonable prices ."
otherwise i would have seriously considered five stars .
three stars for the food .
not the case for the loving hut .
"different chef on duty , perhaps ?"
best shawerma in the city bar none .
"polite , attentive and yet not intrusive service ."
avoid sundays in october .
"hell , they may as well have closed ."
entrees were adequate to mediocre .
perhaps all the really good stuff was gone .
service was adequate but amateurish .
the waiter did n't seem too experienced .
it ' s much the better place .
a little of this place goes a long way .
i ' ll be back .
a great lunch spot .
"large and tasty portions , friendly and helpful staff ."
such as at amc .
no reason at all .
do n't have that at amc .
"unnecessarily loud , and detracted from the experience ."
surprisingly good house cabernet sold by the carafe .
their eggrolls are a must - large and succulent .
food was delicious and at a decent price .
it does smell like vanilla when you enter aria .
to compensate we were offered a bottle of water .
"aria , does not provide in-room coffee service ."
other reviewers have mentioned aria ' s scratchy towels .
i loved the shower & deep soaking tub layout .
that ' s about it for service .
overall we would give aria another chance .
it ' s a nice place .
always a warm greeting in the halls .
hotel lobby : 0.0 stars .
jean <UNK> : 0.0 stars .
self parking : 0 stars .
casino : 0 stars .
deluxe room : 0.0 stars .
cafã © <UNK> : 0 stars .
key word : was .
"that evening , the bass started again ."
this place is quite good !
no compensation or discount was provided .
i ' d avoid this place .
"thanks , <UNK> ' s , for being awesome ."
great atmosphere and place to just hang out .
"foodwise , the salami board is pretty good ."
sort of a lowest common <UNK> approach .
your run of the mill offerings .
the sandwiches are all around $ 00 .
"yep , i said it ."
the rest are n't bad either .
best poutine we had in montreal .
"good gravy , good fries , tasty cheese ."
surrounding you will be trees and wildlife .
avocado makes everything better .
meander throughout and try to get lost .
of any kind of bagel anywhere .
"sorry , new york ."
do not fight this sensation .
the <UNK> classic burger was outstanding .
why ca n't all burgers be that good ?
"stop there , and you ' ll be happy ."
"the tofu scramble was really , really good ."
the tofu is merely folded into the sauce .
this easily beats chicago ' s lincoln park zoo .
"take , for example , the steak sandwich ."
the burger also looked <UNK> large and delicious .
<UNK> amazing squash curry .
"no harm , no foul ."
"really , it ' s quite a good bagel ."
but fairmont has the better bagel .
excellent hog and cod burger with fries .
blood orange cosmo was excelled and very cold .
waited 00 min and there is hardly anyone here .
great restaurant very nice atmosphere and friendly staff .
the italian beefs are the same as back home .
the service was excellent .
the main courses were awesome .
once seated the waiter was on point .
"however , the pasta and sauce was cooked excellently ."
"overall , the food was good and above average ."
the meat was prepared perfectly .
our room was a great layout and nice .
we had a great meal and service .
the service was excellent by the busser & server .
i ordered the 00 oz .
australian lobster tail and it was amazing .
the only downside i would say was the alcohol .
overall it was a great meal and service .
congrats dave and <UNK> !
top notch ice cream delivered the real way .
excellent service only topped by the unbelievable food .
the best dining experience for me by far .
now a weekly spot after my first visit .
the food is awesome here .
wife had the taco salad with green chili chicken .
there was a thick layer of dust every where .
the only reason for 0 stars was the service .
shame on mario for allowing this to happen .
very professionally minded young man .
offering no options to me .
better under than over the time limit !
the steaks were perfect .
just a thought from my wife .
is this place a crib for hooking ?
more midnight traffic than a 00 hour dennys .
should have checked yelp first .
now this is not your regular host band .
i had such a great experience here .
will defiantly recommend to friends .
this place is very nice .
"great pork dumplings , too !"
worst ihop in the line of <UNK> .
the wrap was amazing .
a great healthy alternative .
get some air <UNK> .
this pizza was bad at best .
cheap tasting ... low quality ingredients .
this was excellent though in every way .
definitely recommend the place .
what more could you want ?
and you can smoke if you want .
"forget the haters , come try this place ."
i know i ' ll be back .
its really a great atmosphere .
best buy employees are trained to focus on customers .
do n't insult him ... eat .
please ... do not be fooled .
called the civic arena .
why not on the strip ?
"light , airy interior ."
come here for car bomb .
"bad food , <UNK> atmosphere ."
"well , thank god for that ."
"shop here , shop here now ."
"shop here , shop here , shop here now ."
sushi guy is great .
may have looked good on paper .
must not be that bad .
"a tattooed girl works here , though ."
and they ' re impressive .
"but hey , it ' s pittsburgh ."
this place shocked t-bone .
"too dated , too dark ."
the owner fixed the problem .
"all nude , all the time ."
who is john <UNK> ?
"well ... for starters , he built this place ."
cool back in the day .
day has become tomorrow .
"good people , great food ."
best sandwich i ' ve ever had .
this place has its place .
certainly not disney land .
tacky as all hell .
i ' m a biker chick .
crowded and bad beer .
forum shops a blast .
but better than three rivers ?
give <UNK> tax bucks .
go and check it out .
their menus are fun .
uhhh ... where ' s my pizza ?
a meal that was bland .
try a gay bar .
the best buffet in vegas .
"you did good , pittsburgh ."
yet ` ` the shining ' ' ?
do n't insult <UNK> .
bad food and bad drinks .
worst joint in pittsburgh .
but this is a must .
this is a must try in clt .
outside and inside seating .
this is a must do in clt .
best pizza in town and great location .
this is a clt must .
drink eat or just shop and leave .
great location in south end .
great tacos with a simple yet flavorful menu .

nice choice for a diner style burger joint .
always good drinks and they have a heavy pour .
amazing latin fusion chicken .
great sides and fantastic sauce .
best noodle bar in charlotte .
must eat in clt .
good spot in uptown .
also good local beers on tap to choose from .
good share tapas plates .
great location near the park and baseball stadium .
good for tapas style and sharing .
maybe they ' re out of business ?
it ' s cold stone .
this place is awesome .
this guy really knows what he ' s doing .
this place is awesome .
this guy really knows what he ' s doing .
keep up the great work !
keep chasing clouds people ! ! - chase clouds
this is absolutely my favorite pizza of all time .
the service and the food were both excellent .
nicely updated with a modern feel .
the mushroom croquette appetizer was incredible .
i ca n't recommend this place enough .
incredible quality and value .
good buzz in this place .
atmosphere is ok ... not much too it .
patio seating is available as well .
good job on that night .
the beer is great and love drinking micro brews .
where have these things been all of my life ?
four peaks you did it again !
burgers and wings are great .
prime rib sliders are very good .
tandoori chicken and the chicken curry are the bomb !
that ' s about it .
the al ' s beef sandwich was also good .

the proprietor said that ' s what they do .

"always , enjoying the simple things in life ."
the <UNK> south division .
you guys came pretty close to beating the <UNK> .
lock him up and keep him a panther .
also the only player worth mentioning .
"always , enjoying the simple things in life ."
a soda fountain would be much more convenient .
"other than that , this place owns my heart ."
the insalata is simple and satisfying .
there are never enough registers open .
the food at this place used to be fantastic .
two times in ten years ... nothing changed .
this was my first time ordering from napoli pizzeria .
the pasta does leave a bit to be desired .
and both gentlemen were very kind to our dogs .
"thanks , tim & james !"
"shame about the service , also very dark ."
high end burger joint .
service was good ; food was bad .
desert was pretty bland .
0st - menu is eclectic and <UNK> .
this is what we call a win-win .
my egg whites spinach omelette was excellent .
always good to see an independent .
the owners here are gracious and <UNK> .
this place is a total rip off .
ps - the service sucks badly .
worse than macaroni grill .
we need more pubs like this in edinburgh .
the drinks are excellent as well .
apart from that it ' s mainly bad things .
it is so god damn good .
just another example of tesco taking over the world .
"fear not though , because bonsai is here ."
i enjoyed the deep fried shredded beef noodles .
in addition there are a few little <UNK> extras .
there are good bottled ciders and also <UNK> .
the food is immense here as well .
the plates are massive compared to other pub portions .
so i am a notorious curry fiend .
the food is pretty average as well .
"it is pricey , <UNK> and designed for tourists ."
"and the food is really , really good ."
no <UNK> luck dear readers .
"once inside though , the pub disappoints a bit ."
"during the summer , the meadows shines ."
it ' s piss really .
just a bit dull all round really .
because it ' s shit .
"simply put , why not ?"
the club itself is pretty dire as well .
this is a truly awful place .
and the fish is incredible .
this was not the case .
to be frank it ' s pretty boring .
and that ' s all .
well obviously some but not a lot .
and it is awesome .
and the food is awesome .
the only downside is the price .
the selection of teas is frankly astounding .
sounds strange but is excellent .
the staff were quite cool when i went in .
no <UNK> <UNK> here or <UNK> <UNK> .
this little place really surprised me .
a good find this is another average kebab joint .
the food is pretty average .
as a result fish is back on the menu .
"in regards to bars , yeah sure ."
seems like a cool biker bar .
classic rock plays and motorcycle shit is everywhere .
it ' s similar to general <UNK> chicken .
best place to reserve a game or system .
they tout this as voted best sandwich in america .
it ' s happening right now .
that makes the biggest difference .
good happy hour and good food .
0 star burger for sure .
we chose la <UNK> on chance .
"instead , i got chinese food delivery rice ."
get this crap off of the menu .
my major complaint would have to be our waiter .
uninterested does not begin to describe this man .
all of this for 00 bucks ?
the service is mostly good .
said they were closed @user 0: 00 .
there were plenty of reasonably-priced options to choose from .
appetizer - clam chowder .
entree - i got the king crab legs .
perfect finish to a great meal .
buns were cold and greasy .
food was served room temp .
this is what a sandwich shop should be .
"as noted by others , their turkey rocks ."
simple enough - right ?
a chicago family serving a chicago dog w ketchup ?
"chicago dogs are never , ever served w ketchup ."
"hopefully , <UNK> has better success ."
fries are fresh hand cut with the skins on .
excellent service - attentive without being intrusive .
the portions were great and very tasty .
it was quite good .
excellent bar with excellent food .
if i am at a diner fine then .
i will be back for sure .
these guys really know their barbecue .
it will change your life .
"tomato bisque , veal parmesan , side of spinach ."
slightly below average food .
way overpriced for the quality .
all you can eat was a good deal .
went there for new years eve .
"it ' s phoenix , not new york darling ."
i simply just walked out at that point .
it was half of a full breast .
how does this place stay in business ?
try this place it ' s well worth it .
definitely the best authentic mexican in the area .
the hibachi chicken is excellent .
i had the <UNK> burrito and it was fantastic .
had a craving for sushi in viva las vegas .
the taste was very buttery and very well marinated .
also order some salmon sashimi and other sushi .
all the fish was very fresh and very good .
just no flavor what so ever on these sandwiches .
tried the pastrami and the cajun chicken .
everything on the menu looks amazing .
excellent selection on the menu .
prices ran about $ 00 - $ 00 .
"lots of different meats , seafood , and pastas ."
"crab legs , sushi , and kobe beef ."
maybe just stick to the known chains or pizza .
i guess this is more of a kid place .
open bar from 00-00 pm .
"i repeat , literally could not move ."
i have given up on sushi in phoenix .
this place will do just fine .
i would actually say its above average .
conclusion - for ayce this place sucks donkey dick .
good bang for buck food .
ambiance - typical commercialized modern bar scene .
"however , i ' m sure others would disagree ."
fish tacos - typical mexican style fish tacos .
possibly another reason to come ?
- understaffed for an easily <UNK> busy tuesday .
who cares about service right ?
food is first and foremost .
- hamachi : great and consistent generous cuts .
conclusion - good bang for buck !
get full off of sushi for under $ 00 ?
the best place for pho hands down .
<UNK> : what the pho ?
generous shrimp and pork cuts .
the cheesesteak was ordinary .
fun atmosphere and great food really normal prices .
prices high plating is nice but food was cool .
the lamb with huevos rancheros was fantastic .
but even better was the steak & eggs .
the restaurant atmosphere is very nice as well .
"the shakes are good , but pricey ."
my problem with this place is the wait time .
the <UNK> had good flavor .
the pros the food was very good .
i would suggest other steakhouses on the strip .
my three practices all had amber <UNK> leading .
do n't order this .
must have been the sauce or something .
after i ordered it i decided to google sriracha .
turns out its thai hot sauce .
the thai know how to do hot .
it seemed like a good idea at the time .
the rustic atmosphere is the first thing you notice .
my wife had some trendy <UNK> .
what a simple idea .
"like i said though , just ok ."
i ordered the half rack of bbq pork ribs .
the ribs were average .
that was probably the best thing about the evening .
i ordered the carne asada .
it was tender and good but not great .
the service was very good .
you should skip this place .
nice place to eat .
"simple , fluffy and tasty ."
i <UNK> them first and tried the skillet after .
the wife ordered the crabby one crepes .
then i called back several times and nobody answered .
i recently returned from a conference in las vegas .
had a blast watching the karaoke and prive club .
the new poker room was nice .
however i have three minor complaints : 0 .
just want it quick .
things got off to a shaky start .
all was fresh and presented with care .
this simply could not have been better .
if you want breakfast go to denny ' s .
definitely the usual cheap chinese plaza eats .
there is a 00 % student discount .
but this place is n't worth your money anymore .
last call ' s at 0:00 pm .
<UNK> ramen serves an excellent bowl of ramen !
edit : i think these are gone now .
"cheaper , just as good and shorter line ."
"party of 0 , weekday night ."
food portions are large for the price charged .
it was soft and tasted very good .
their pizzas are incredibly cheap .
service here is good .
i would not recommend this .
the taste of the sushi maki was average .
there is a 0 % cash discount .
"only accepted are cash and credit , no debit ."
the restaurant is clean and newly decorated .
we got by without speaking any french perfectly fine .
this place has great value .
the food quality is above average .
- rrb - and the prices are competitive .
the rolls are small and rushed with poor presentation .
service charge is included in your bill .
i never ever ever write reviews about chain restaurants .
"oddly , i did n't see a cheese pizza ."
the wings are large .
"went again , and service has deteriorated ."
<UNK> changes to ordering makes it difficult for customers .
super bomb latin flavor explosions !
obviously the on-time confirmation number means nothing .
great drinks crafted perfectly .
notorious for fresh juice and strong drinks .
you wo n't be disappointed here .
all the praise for the food here is accurate .
so i wo n't waste <UNK> typing about that .
the al pastor tacos are my favorites .
"so for that reason , this place fails ."
major disappointment on a nfl sunday .
just completely lazy and incompetent .
this review is entirely service based .
no check-in by anyone after the food came .
i thought this was a sure winner .
after some shifting during the 00mins .
we ended up back there an hour later .
it ' s a museum experience in three acts .
i ' m from los angeles .
"unfortunately , my brother lives in scottsdale ."
they can speak either spanish or english .
lift was real easy to operate .
but since i cant .
had dinner here last week .
food was quite good .
service was very good .
this place is good .
been here many times over a lot of years .
a surprisingly good restaurant for such an ordinary hotel .
"very nice room , great atmosphere ."
service was good and very attentive .
the prices are not to bad .
you can dress up or go casually .
very great place and food is outstanding .
great food and great place .
great icecream and great customer service .
"good food , fast and pretty decent price ."
this place is great .
my wife and i catch ourselves coming here alot .
great views and very great customer service .
very nice and great place to stay .
went here awhile back for a buddies birthday party .
very nice place and great service .
"very good place though , and easy to find ."
good place had the 00 hour pass .
all i can say is wow .
wife and i went here one night at midnight .
the inside is clean and very nice looking .
good spot for people traveling right off the interstate .
if you are a guy i would recommend <UNK> .
great atmosphere and great food .
typical walmart not in the greatest area .
great show anytime of the day .
very good food and great atmosphere with many people .
my wife and i love this place .
very friendly people and food taste great .
good beer and food great for kids also .
great place many seats .
have movies for sell and many selections .
"the food is not bad , and reasonably priced ."
big strong cocktails and a big strong bill .
who cares it was great !
i am a huge fan .
more huge due to this steak house .
should be spelled ` ` ill ' ' <UNK> .
what have you done ?
this was a tremendous disappointment !
go to rao ' s instead .
go here folks for a nice romantic dinner .
"its an airport , enough said ."
nothing fancy or top notch .
otherwise not much else to say about the place .
overall 0 - stars .
also the food was not to bad either .
i must say i do like the place .
but last year it was quite good .
prices vary depending on the shows .
best butcher in the city .
thankfully the <UNK> picks up after them .
other then that when its clean its great .
bought a simple loaf of bread .
bit expensive as well .
anyways really cool little cafe .
specializes in organic food .
a nice simple review .
not a bad little bargain store .
but otherwise seems like a good little place .
have your normal selection of beers and other booze .
also has a great selection of whiskey .
prices are about right to .
located outside of town going towards <UNK> .
what happened to the days of free water .
"has its fresh produce , meats , ect act ."
they walk around with samples for everyone to try .
prices are reasonable i think .
the crowd that comes in is a good mix .
has surprisingly good curry .
even the comedian was complaining / joking about it .
what an amazing place .
helps them save money by giving you filler .
if you are in the area check it out !
great little middle eastern style market / store .
i dont shop there that much .
"average little place , not great not bad ."
liked the steak pie .
the burrito i had was not to bad .
not great but not bad .
that what this place is .
one of my favorite pubs on the royal mile .
i really enjoy their haggis there i recommend it .
didnt get to busy either which is great .
this place did that for me .
staff is nice and know what they are doing .
staff was meh not great but not bad .
short and simple and a bold statement .
not the biggest selection but the basics .
the place is average at best .
thats not all that bad at all .
just a busy fast food area .
a beer compliments it very well i believe .
not a bad little wine shop at all .
"the <UNK> , which was a bucket of meats ."
it was a meal unto itself .
then my t-rex steak arrived .
best fish market in the city .
thats all i got to say for this update .
this place was excellent !
i actually like this place .
the flavor and presentation of them is amazing .
the staff are also friendly which is a plus .
and i love burgers .
but i was pleasantly surprised when i eat here .
i had chicken burrito with the works .
place is a-ok in my book .
what can i recommend ?
but everything else it has plenty .
i am a coin collector .
eh it ' s an ok shopping centre .
the food is ok .
i will be going back .
what a great pub .
great beer as well and reasonably priced .
not a bad little italian restaurant at all .
on a positive note the staff was great .
the stuff adds up so you are warned !
not a bad little cafe .
both present and past .
seems pretty legit in my book .
finally got around to trying this place .
had the big sashimi bowl .
bunch of fresh sashimi over ice .
lots of variety if pubs and restaurants .
this will be short and sweet because .
. well frankly its a train station !
this is a good climbing gym .
this is where i get my gear from .
its imported or comes from local sources .
anyways go here folks great little french shop !
excellent little fish and chips / italian place .
left me comfortably full and tasted great .
nectar from the gods .
but its a nice area .
i think they might be the cheapest as well .
do not eat here .
or be careful if you do .
eat here at your own risk .
the oven needs a bit of <UNK> in .
plastic plates and steak knives are not friends .
<UNK> beans are pulled properly albeit into paper cups .
paper cups and casino pricing hold that last star .
that said this is a scant four stars .
i found the staff to be pleasant as well .
this is what every neighborhood brewery should be .
there are currently five taps with more to come .
though some of the clientele can be .
just do n't set your expectations up to high .
i had high expectations of this place .
my steak was lukewarm .
"and , for a bit cheaper ."
the ravioli was the better meal .
did n't notice any dank smell as <UNK> suggested .
"<UNK> is really nice , tasteful ."
lunch menu just does n't work for me .
the other side was spiced with chilis .
eaten here 00 or more times .
"food is very good , always clean ."
hot and sour soup is always great .
place was packed and it ' s obvious why .
"inexpensive , tasty , no disappointments and very clean ."
you can gorge yourself for $ 00 here .
"food was very solid ... rib appetizers , awesome ."
all new furnishings throughout .
first off ... the pho .
so beef pho just makes sense .
their pho is terrific .
clearly there is some genius here .
pho was extremely satisfying .
every table in the place occupied .
different strokes for different folks i guess .
i ' m <UNK> what to order .
"now linda , please , can i get refills ?"
now for the fun part .
everyone knows my po box address .
for this you can not go wrong here .
most everything is in the typical range .
heard nothing but praise from all .
i know what heaven is like now .
so this is the bottom line here .
hands down best coffee and service and las vegas .
"salad selections were sparse , meats were mediocre ."
and our drinks took over 00 minutes to arrive .
had a big variety of dishes .
the service is attentive and courteous .
the food and the staff are well above average !
im surprised this place is still open .
hotel condition is shit .
dont give them your money .
good drinks if you have jeffrey as your bartender .
i strongly recommend that you try them out sometime .
best bang for your buck in vegas .
very nice new hotel in a great location .
nice lobby with a good bar .
"large , comfortable room ."
good conference rooms and associated services .
i would certainly recommend .
this place is great .
avoid this place for a meal .
"no apology , just a statement ."
at 0:00 am i checked out of the hotel .
the floor was wet from some cooler <UNK> .
and you will never go away hungry .
especially with the quantity of the sides .
"i like <UNK> , and this place is better !"
the food is outstanding .
"service is outstanding , which is unusual around here ."
the sopapillas are a nice touch after the meal .
i ' d highly recommend si senor to anyone .
<UNK> the night before thanksgiving .
my wife enjoyed the stroganoff .
the scallops were large and juicy .
spicy hot is a very subjective thing .
everything i ' ve had here has been good .
for breakfast i would suggest the original breakfast burrito .
serve it yourself salsas make this extremely enjoyable also .
great people and a great product .
great food and great people .
i checked rates at the post office .
casey ' s is great .
i will certainly admit that they do good work .
they have great daily beer and food specials .
the california carver pizza is super unique and amazing .
"also , it is very bike friendly ."
"tvs with sports , booze , and good food ."
way to screw over your customers guys .
how high was the curly haired blonde kid today ?
"great food , just a little spendy ."
"no complaints , absolutely great ."
the chicken was good and fresh off the <UNK> .
for the price this is some damn good food .
i ordered a green chile bacon breakfast burrito .
i give it a 0 star .
this cafe is open 00 hours a day .
i rate this place 0 stars .
"best pizza , best suicide fries ."
"unfortunately , that is where the positives ended ."
may he rest in peace .
"while they were not bad , just nothing outstanding ."
the steaks were just ok .
the coffee shop closes from 0-0 pm daily .
you will not be pleased .
i would n't go back to a wynn property .
appears the culture here is to provide awesome service .
kudos to ryan and this in and out burgers .
quite possibly the slowest moving place on earth .
took over 00 mins to get a car .
avoid this one if you can .
as good as it gets !
i like this restaurant very much .
crab cakes were excellent .
no <UNK> in this establishment .
"still , it was a nice place ."
now they seem to view customers as an interruption .
disappointing but lots of other options in the area .
long waits in the arcade .
0 beer per hour maximum .
avoid at all costs .
awesome spot to grab a dog for a buck .
"nothing fancy , must standard ingredients and friendly service ."
i ' d recommend this place .
had a huge seafood plate that was very fresh .
a body of <UNK> .
flavor always on point .
<UNK> worst service ever .
employees were slow as all heck taking their time .
"unless they were short staffed , then i understand ."
they get me in & out .
i was reminded of a backyard bbq burger .
great quality tasting food .
best tacos in phoenix !
i think the owners name is monty .
it was absolutely incredible .
taste level was outstanding for both - - 0/0 .
"outstanding omakase , surprising in scottsdale ."
really well done chef ' s choice tasting .
the <UNK> is japanese and runs the show .
some of the servers are japanese too .
good mix of flavors and especially textures .
this is especially important since they use warm rice .
as i said ... authentic !
these guys do and it makes the sub outstanding !
"again , good food but expect a long wait ."
pretty darn good cheese steak .
reminded us of the crab cooker in newport .
tamales and the wifes salad were good .
i guess you love it or you hate it .
cant say i enjoyed the food .
favorite breakfast spot around .
well the service was great .
the deserts are unreal !
the chicken was excellent .
the beans and slaw were good .
i also expect the rims to be cleaned .
00 minute wait with lots of open tables .
wifes steak was a pretty bad cut of meat .
this place is hit and miss .
<UNK> was very pleasant and quick to my table .
i had a great western omelet .
excellent atmosphere and great coffee and crepes !
cool place to hang out and do some work .
"very professional , great atmosphere and reasonable prices ."
every barber in the building has skill .
the price was right so it gets 0 stars .
i ' m a fan .
this place is the real deal .
this place did its job .
i am extremely happy with <UNK> and his crew .
i believe this place will appeal to anyone .
the staff are extremely efficient though .
best go if you ' re in town .
they even washed my truck .
did not have a <UNK> pizza on the menu .
have 0 friends that go to him as well .
the gold standard is by far my favorite burger .
"pick this place , you will not be disappointed ."
i do wish the price was cheaper .
they finished up way early than i expected .
i highly recommend these guys .
inexpensive and very clean .
i will be going back .
rice and beans are great too .
great food great prices .
i brought my honda here .
they saved me some money .
not too much motivation to serve customers it seems .
enter the <UNK> bar .
is the food any good ?
that would be a huge mistake .
ambiance : really nice but very classy and casual .
the meal was ... incredible .
wine : the wine collection is extensive .
<UNK> whoop whoop whoop whoop whoop <UNK> .
sales associate tee is a peach .
"as a factory store , they carry everything <UNK> ."
service was competent and relatively pleasant .
"both were satisfying and tasty , and well prepared ."
"traditional italian dishes , adequately prepared ."
hooray for corporate amex .
$ 00 for pho .
it surpassed all expectations .
i was greeted with excitement as i walked in .
my favorite is the mayan pibil taco .
i ca n't get enough of the pecan salsa .
my wife just ordered a sam adams .
we did not order any food .
this place needs to call jon <UNK> asap .
it showed that they really care for you .
the best korean food in las vegas !
the cream of chicken appetizer was also tasty .
it was very tasty and tender .
the wife had bacon cheese burger with fries .
we event treated ourselves to shakes .
i had the portabella sandwich on ciabatta bread .
it comes with a fairly tasty spinach salad .
overall a great new find !
the burgers are huge .
the fries are good as well .
all in all a good value for the price .
this is solely for xs <UNK> on sunday nights .
they had a dj pumping beats .
big groups sitting at big tables ordering big steaks .
women looking for bottles ?
does n't get much better then that .
i would recommend this to just about anyone .
come experience highway robbery close up .
"in conclusion , this business deserves to fail ."
"they are inept , disrespectful , and downright invasive ."
go there at your own risk .
and their <UNK> pizza is a must have .
the slowest <UNK> anywhere .
the rumors are true .
my girlfriend was able to meet him there .
all this happened very quickly .
the best casual dining you will find anywhere .
the pizza is new york style and delicious .
a lot of places claim they make <UNK> cocktails .
it really does pay off with the end result .
sides were also very good .
nice and greasy as you might expect .
their fish market had some really outstanding whitefish .
"generally bland dim sum , rice and stir fry ."
stopped in here for lunch .
great bar and happy hour .
this is my go to spot .
too many other spots to get your fix .
real cool vibe in central phoenix .
best 0 bucks money can buy for lunch !
i get the 000 no tripe .
simply give business to such a nice guy .
i ' ve been going here for years .
nothing bad to say about this place .
"great beers , too ."
then a slice of swiss and some deli mustard .
i grabbed a side of sauerkraut and a drink .
my <UNK> old definitely stayed away .
"thanks again , joe !"
what a cool place .
"want good beer , go here ."
"if you are lost , find film bar ."
they ' re across the street .
stay far far away from this fedex .
the pork one is just ok .
a few other notes .
the beer selection has become very limited .
"if you want football , they have it ."
"nice people , good beer , ok food ."
the breakfast food was very standard .
a gem near my house .
great place ... i ' ll be back .
old <UNK> vegas at its best .
but fremont has character !
two men were inside watching the game .
"the mac & cheese was good , though ."
the buffalo sauce and the bbq were both fantastic .
i added extra bbq and it worked .
went here with a few of the regulars .
give it a shot .
just spun and would not connect .
stop by and try it out .
"haven burger , wow ."
we paid too much money for that meal .
"- rrb - , and ran a <UNK> ."
good meat on my burrito .
nothing too stringy or cooked wrong .
i ' d stop back .
order half your usual spice level .
"the food is good , tasty , and average ."
the burger was awesome .
"the holiday series films are really good , too ."
went here recently with a couple and their child .
get there early & bring your own booze .
"when i go , i always get the calzone ."
i ended up with an off menu bob marley .
this is my favorite sharp edge of them all .
sharp edge is a must .
he said ` ` something like that ' ' .
"just average , consistent pie ."
"yes , this is a small business ."
"yes , rene is a man ."
it says that in several places on the webpage .
"terrible , greasy , and god awfully pricey ."
problems i had were all service .
i opted for ice tea that was never refilled .
"simply put , the service was slower than <UNK> ."
but the food was n't bad .
it wraps around and starts again .
the food was literally average quality .
love me some dick .
"wow , there ' s nothing light in here ."
the bartender kevin was awesome .
best mexican food around .
"their red hot sauce is really good , too ."
i am still out on this one .
her food was cheap and looked awesome .
this was a sunday morning at 0am .
this is a gem .
the pizzas are single people pizzas .
the ambiance struck me immediately .
great great coffee house .
they do not have wifi in this hotel either .
the <UNK> burger and cheese plates are the best .
"if you like beer , come here ."
my wife got lunch and i ordered breakfast .
this place is fantastic .
i was pissed and called them .
the food is just ok .
i like free wireless and i like ice tea .
it used to be better here .
"no silverware or anything , just the food ."
we asked for <UNK> and silverware .
cost a lot but was n't totally tasty .
"great place to work , grade , and chill ."
i was looking for a place close to home .
this place is just ok .
do n't eat here unless you ' re rich .
i heard this was the best gyro in town .
they ' re good to their own .
this is a weird place .
"my buddies ' sandwich rocked , too ."
"ice tea and beer are both tasty , too ."
got drinks quickly and ordered food .
"nice location , parking available , and good times ."
i was in the only cigarette line !
and beers only come chilled now .
it ' s great pakistani food near my house .
parking sucked but it was a cool place .
so here i go .
but here are the flaws .
"also , costs too much money ."
"ok , i ' m back ."
looks like things have gotten way better .
try it out today .
he said everyone should buy macs .
this is a cool little joint off roosevelt row .
"- rrb - , it was a cool hotel ."
"the food was pretty good , too ."
now let ' s jump ahead to now .
over the last year new management has taken over .
i will be going elsewhere in the future .
this place is awesome .
i ' ve been there three times .
"nice location , bad product this time ."
love their music scene here but wanted food first .
the couple left without getting their food .
skip this <UNK> ' s completely .
- lrb - can you give half a star ?
to a lower class existence .
i made a comment about drug <UNK> .
the lodge has the best food around .
ahi appetizer is great !
great service great food and the coffee was good .
' ' it ' s <UNK> tacky .
i would guess nearly 00 minutes .
i had the pork belly sliders which were excellent .
the food was good and the price was right .
the texture and flavor was complex and beefy .
a complimentary lemon flavored <UNK> followed our meal .
our meal at julian serrano was fantastic .
i could eat plates and plates of these .
flavorful and salty because of the ham .
manchego cheese added saltiness to it .
no extra walls blocking sight lines .
the casino was decent .
drink service while playing was excellent .
room itself was great .
cabanas are much more expensive .
one of the best seafood dishes i have had .
also served with some garlic spinach on the side .
my favorite dish is the sausage & pepperoni pizza .
they also make fresh gelato daily that is outstanding !
average breakfast - little expensive for what you get .
last minute as i can be .
do you really come for the wings and beer ?
"other wise , everything else was scratch ."
better than equivalent restaurants that uses animal products .
not a place with drunk college kids .
mostly ` ` natives ' ' .
the club is clean and has great equipment .
the quesadillas are also out of this world .
the regularly priced menu offers good value as well .
everything else they make is top notch .
the coconut biscuits and brownies are insane .
asked them to clean never did .
but fan in ceiling .
<UNK> very <UNK> for a 00 dollar dinner buffet .
most all exceeded our expectations .
well what can be added to the other complaints .
the pool was closed due to different stories .
barely warm chili and dogs .
the <UNK> knots needed more garlic .
the salad was too wet from cleaning watery .
the pho is small .
the general knows his stuff !
"unfortunately , it is only prepared sometimes ."
<UNK> is a great night club .
my only complaint was the weak drinks .
my wife ' s margarita was the same way .
"my experience was otherwise great here , good food ."
went there the other day and it was great .
good ramen place with super friendly staff .
definetly will be going back this establishment .
happy i found this place on yelp .
great food and great atmosphere .
the service was not as good as usual tonight .
bananas foster was excellent .
great food and fantastic atmosphere .
the tiramisu is a must .
<UNK> r served our party of 00 <UNK> .
best breakfast in pennsylvania period .
the strawberry crepe hotcakes are incredible .
everything about this hotel is top notch .
tasks place is awesome .
the hours are actually 00:00 -00:00 .
the restaurant looks nice and inviting .
the other selections from the <UNK> looks pretty good .
discount repaired it free of charge .
great service every time i have been there .
first visit to this establishment ever .
we as consumers need to demand better treatment !
those things are badass .
zero to a hundred to zero in ten seconds .
<UNK> gets five stars for the service alone .
great atmosphere with sleek chrome and black leather .
and that ' s saying something .
the kitchen could n't seem to get anything right .
the place has severe management issues .
"the staff is friendly , knowledgeable and patient ."
good tasting frozen yogurt .
overall an extremely enjoyable meal .
who does n't like pizza and beer ?
overall i really loved tony ' s slice house .
there was dust everywhere .
it was an alright experience overall .
this is definitely a management issue .
"a tasty balanced pie , at a fair price ."
pepsi tastes like mexican dirt water .
all very friendly and helpful with the menu .
"no pasta , no wow factor except the price ."
the spaghetti and meatballs was bland and mostly noodles .
"wtf , no liquor license in vegas ?"
"like i said great idea , poorly executed ."
open until 00pm means open until 00pm .
highly recommend this place .
either way highly reputable .
and that ' s a big reason .
cant fault a single thing about this place .
"the sauce is fresh , the mozzarella is outstanding ."
now for the prices .
they seem to be higher than anyone else .
that <UNK> any vacation .
this is the absolute worst taxi service ever .
top notch service and a great facility .
i believe my <UNK> name was martin .
try the lamp chops and beef carpaccio .
in the bellagio hotel .
today was mister steer ' s lucky day .
so why four stars and not five ?
"overall , though , i have no complaints ."
the magic and the comedy are first-rate .
you will be amazed .
"dated for sure , but clean and comfortable ."
best fried chicken you will ever eat .
"first of all , excellent name ."
this is a solid place to see a show .
trying to get anywhere in here is a journey .
got a chance to see something here ?
these are the tough choices of life .
this quiet city got loud .
five stars it is .
"but screw it , who cares ."
the <UNK> is two parts .
a great spot to hang before a show .
"besides that though , solid all around ."
and that ' s just what they do .
what a lineup here .
the reviews from this place have exploded !
like you ' ve been wrapped in fresh laundry .
but it does n't stop there .
this place is just awesome .
you ca n't spell wings without win !
"plus , woah to that bar ."
"aw , a nice spot for a nice breakfast ."
you take what you can get though .
the food was excellent .
easily one of the best desserts in the city .
i ' ll be back next trip for sure !
a very cool bar with a very cool feel .
no question at all .
"ok , i ' m lost ."
what the hell guys .
want to find a taxi ?
let me tell you why i like this place .
and that is why these guys are the winners .
"hands down , the winner ."
in the oldest student union in the world .
the food was excellent .
i highly recommend the shrimp george .
possibly the worst pizza i have ever eaten .
beers are in the $ 0 range .
my steak was excellent and the deserts were amazing .
"fantastic burger , maybe the best burger ."
"big shots , cute waitress , and nice service ."
nothing stood out for me to go back .
huge screen for sports .
came here to watch a unlv game .
nothing food wise stood out .
oh well i love the stuff .
"its good , service sucks ."
it was all worth it thou .
very casual setting in a beat up old casino .

i literally paid to observe a horse circus nightmare .
some were still frozen and most were quite small .
the prime rib was good but not great .
all rooms stink of <UNK> extremely .
never ever to be back to this hell hole .
"at the end , a gratuity was automatically added ."
certainly nothing worth waiting for .
it ' s been disappointing to say the least .
not really a large selection .
food is not bad but not very flavorful .
drinks were a joke .
maybe more of a college food shop .
i would not go back there for the steak .
i was starting to get depressed just being there .
the italian sub was very tasty .
the pizza is like a better little caesars .
best gyros in the valley .
today i went to this place after reviewing yelp .

this vet is all about the money .
this is vet place not a bank .
i would not recommend this business at all .
"standard fare , but reasonable well prepared ."
it is not the servers fault .
finally found a decent korean restaurant around town .
nothing like la but it ' s acceptable .
well my hands are washed and starving to death .
nothing remotely resembling calamari .
nice big thin slices and <UNK> cheap .
and pasta bar showed what simplicity of pasta was .
. i do n't plan on dining here again .
my first time experiencing in-n-out burger was in california .
"actually , maybe i should give them another shot ."
they do have some really good burgers .
my waitress greeted with a smile .
so this was my adventure at red lobster again .
the waiter was very professional and was extremely attentive .
finally i found a good pho place around town .
you ruin the flavor of the broth .
"next , the entree ."
so i took his advice and ordered .
"a good , friendly crowd ."
big pieces of fish in the huge tacos .
would i come back - for fish tacos yes .
especially if you are traveling with your furry companions .
that ' s a simple no brainer .
i have no complain with this property .
the vehicle was new though still crap .
beware deceptive pricing on liquor offerings .
the service is very good .
i might try another pizza place in vegas .
or i might not bother .
"price , service , and taste are all fantastic ."
the rib eye was fantastic !
wife and i agreed that the flavor fell flat .
ordered two pizzas and two orders of wings .
great service and very knowledgeable .
great gym with experienced staff .
it will go down as my <UNK> visit .
i would consider this a minor league operation .
not a premier location .
not a good consumer environment .
a real treat for us desert <UNK> .
the food at bandera was very good .
i need to give a shout-out to the employees .
the menu has great variety .
i have no doubt they support other causes .
food quality was good .
the food quantity was very good .
portions were big without being absurd .
this one fell way short of being respectable .
what ' s the opposite of light and airy ?
maybe it ' ll be cleaner next time .
the staff seems friendly ?
went to buy it .
i ended up getting it for 0 dollars .
the chicken tenders was great aswell .
went to buy it .

staff were all extremely friendly .
i ' ve never seen this at a steakhouse .
let your meat speak for itself .
just arrived to montreal with my wife from toronto .
the atmosphere is excellent .
do n't be fooled by their online menu .
waiter and manager gave us both unpleasant looks .
the southwest burger was an awesome recommendation !
the squeeze and i stopped before dinner .
"liked the place , barkeep was friendly and informative ."
wo n't be back for that reason .
easily the best hamburger i have ever eaten .
i picked the right lawyer for the job .
visiting pitt and stumbled on to this place .

pizza a metro is tha bomb ! ! ... .
great dinning experience for sure .
even better than 00 % .
did n't feel ghetto or anything like that .
the music was very mixed .
"great club , but the crowd is insane !"
for some reason the bouncer split us up .
i was steaming pissed .
the music was excellent .
it did n't stick to one genre .
neighborhood is the biggest drawback .
must have been an off night .
food was slow to be delivered in general .
all ' s well that ends well .
an interesting mix if indian and nepalese food .
this is old school steakhouse style without any soul .
they need an upgrade .
tourists of all ages wearing shorts and t shirts .
overall food = 0 star .
the bread was very stale .
the steak = 0 star .
service = 0 stars .
great spot just off the strip for dinner .
the place is usually quiet and very casual .
overall food = 0 stars .
sides are exactly as expected .
do try the lobster mashed potatoes though .
the steak = 0 stars .
my first porterhouse was average .
well cooked but a bit light on flavor .
my second was a bone-in rib-eye which was outstanding .
wine = 0 stars for a solid wine list .
markup is 00 to 00 % as expected .
definitely paid 00 bucks for a beer .
i recommend going at least once for the experience .
even with drinks they nailed it .
met the owner super chilled guy .
heard theyre going to open <UNK> at henderson !
the carne asada was pretty decent .
i recommend the cornbread also .
great dish prime rib sliders were great as well .
consistency and a decent cheese steak .
chunks of diced steak with plenty of whiz .
i ordered the korean spicy beef .
posted a review to the wrong business .
the pizza came out and it looked awesome .
great all around dish .
lets start with the price .
once inside the movie theater the experience changes though .
everything is a la carte .
then the issue of the seats came back .
this seat was no better .
friendly staff and a nice location .
the green chile pulled pork sandwich with fries .
not overwhelming as some green chile can be .
no ketchup needed with these fries .
love this place and will be back for sure !
this is without a doubt a petsmart .
the bar itself is a typical dive bar .
the a / c could use a little work .
they came out quite fast and tasted great .
the karaoke was a little different of a story .
as far as bars go this place was great .
let me say i was not disappointed .
the combo of everything on that burger was sublime .
the <UNK> bread was excellent too .
i got the steak .
some really good and some really bad .
super soft and taste like they were just made .
"the pork was smoky and moist , tender ."
fresh cinnamon really stood out .
"salad with extra cucumbers and no tomatos , np ."
the food is interesting and unique .
here is my take .
hot links - excellent .
my friend likes burnt brownies so whatever .
great classic vegas pizza place .
my all time favorite pizza now .
the pizza is ready in 0-0 minutes .
the gardens is excellent in all regards .
cleanliness is a high priority here .
talk to eva or jennifer .
amazing selection of various kinds of poutines !
it does n't get much better than this .
"btw , i have had the drunken noodle ."
the food is just ok .
run as fast as you can from this business .
there is a reason for the low rating .
go home and think about your life .
you should be coming here mainly for the party .
question : what is the andy warhol museum ?
i ' ve been all across europe via <UNK> .
"at no charge , mind you ."
the booze in the kitchen is complimentary .
"next , every bartender here is a ten ."
"<UNK> speaking , of course ."

the staff is excellent and the food is perfect .
i want more and would recommend <UNK> anyone .
all of the staff seemed a little stuck up .
the menu has decent variety but nothing special .
great price for huge burritos .
much better then filibertos .

try the macho burrito covered in chili verde .
"in this case , it ' s the former ."

comparable to thai style noodle house .
"just as good as the original , but larger ."
a real irish pub serving great food and drinks .
"not bad , but not capriotti ' s ."
the rest was mediocre at best .
"good prices , great service , great food ."
all i can say is wow !
what ' s not to like ?

the chips and salsa were excellent .
the main culprit was the chicken .
this continued for the rest of the burrito .

it basically looks like a cafeteria .

good food great service and a nice atmosphere .
hot chicks and stiff drinks .
what could be bad about this ?
the sell computers and service them .
this location has closed down .

my dishwasher is again in need of repair .

not a very productive response in my opinion .
the buffet itself was kinda sparse .
even at full price it is worth it .
they should of had a location with a drive-thru .
the staff is very friendly and happy .

"i had the spinach quesadilla , which was great ."
great food but really slow .
all of the meats are really good .
ask how hh <UNK> stands behind their stuff .

noble idea that fails at execution .
that where it totally fails .
"suitable as bird feed , but not for people ."
sides were below average .
should have known better based on <UNK> manager .
"he was helpful and knowledgeable , and professional throughout ."
"without a doubt , this is a must do ."
"the flavors , servers , plates ... ."
to appeal to the craft beer segment .
. serve a beer in a 00oz pint glass !
the fried chicken is excellent tasting .
all in all an easy 0 star for me .
went here searching for a stingray corvette .
though i ended up purchasing from another dealer .
the rest are ok they get a 0 star .
"it ' s simple , but done very well ."
"the highlight , in my opinion are the bathrooms ."
moon is unique in so many ways .
very expensive for a small amount .
suppose to be open to 0 according to yelp .
been going here for years .
prices are getting a little high though .
hosted a party of five .
he paced our courses perfectly .
food was superb and properly presented .
jackie chan would not approve and neither do i .
service was outstanding as well .
looking forward to next time .
this is not really an asian <UNK> joint .
they have chinese dishes and they have mexican dishes .
food is pretty good .
small portions here and a bit pricey .
i do n't review much on yelp .
this is my first choice for breakfast .
"quality food , fresh squeezed juice ."
wait staff is almost always amateurish .
makes for a fun evening .

very good sonoran mexican and nice staff .
can pizza get any better ?
decor and overall atmosphere very hip .

the <UNK> were awesome and the stunts executed perfectly .
"secondly , is the music ."
also criss seems to boast about himself alot .
ok we get it you are a good magician .
overall rating is 0.0 stars out of 0 .
maybe next time le cafe .
here is where things started to go downhill .
overall rating is 0.0 stars out of 0 .
but hey that ' s just me .
i mean this place has alot to offer .
simply amazing and breathtaking .
now on to the review .
and this way you ' re guaranteed a seat .
but the beef wellington was awesome .
just finishing up my duck dinner here !
<UNK> kitchen could really be doing better .
"also , watch your child very closely ."
"great place , well worth your time ."
beer is very solid .
pizza was sub par .
"dough was not cooked enough , not enough sauce ."
i was under the impression that was illegal .
it ' s a rip off either way .
the shrimp <UNK> was actually pretty good .
salsa bar was average .
nothing to really stand out .
"decent food , good prices , awesome happy hour ."
we have ended up there regularly for weeks now .
did n't live up to the hype .
great lounge with plenty of seating options .
horrible service and never again will i go there .
must have the pork belly tacos .
good hotel if you have kids .
the one negative to this place is the food .
i actually looked at my watch and timed it .
why are they limiting my selections ?
do n't serve me food in plastic baskets .
* the food was somewhere between good and excellent .
the fries were nothing special but fine .
the cole slaw was above average .
"the tartar sauce , also , was very impressive ."
"no hassle , fast reliable service ."
stopped by today to get a unit today .
today ' s shrimp in cream sauce was outstanding .
the dude killed it .
this place ... i would simply say .
with its various choices to build your own burger .
the $ 00 <UNK> .
finishing off with a cheesecake burger .
definitely a cherry top finish .
the burgers here are ok .
"on the upside , the portions are pretty big ."
<UNK> that with good food ?
. not much meat in the <UNK> i got .
they even had blair ' s beef jerky !
nothing extraordinary that popped out .
. which is a good sign .
". but most of all , the broth ."
. about $ 00 / meal for a buffet .
. certainly not bad .
as for the other 0 places ?
i ca n't comment .
and the butter fat shakes .
. the food here is good .
. along with it being cheaper than the bacchanal .
. and without a doubt .
the quality of food was decent and not bad .
my sights targeted in for the kill .
the burgers are priced pretty decent .
even that one was cooked nicely and tasted wonderful .
they should rename this place mama ' s kitchen !
this is a fairly nice reptile store .
if you ship your here you must be desperate .
bought my engagement ring here .
also the application for credit was quick and discreet .
all around solid <UNK> food restaurant .
they always get our food right .
the service is always prompt and friendly .
however <UNK> them to give utensils they always forget .
i love mr . <UNK> .
i ' d recommend family auto co to anyone !
good food and not over-priced .
the california turkey sandwich was awesome !
your crooked karma will come back to you !
get your shit right golden eagle moving .
. more like golden pigeon .
the food is pretty damn good .
. no way this place deserves a 0 average .
wife liked her liver .
best doughnuts in vegas .
great menu and awesome beer list .
we started with the garlic cheese bread .
then got the new yorker pizza .
update : gave this place another chance today .
there is nothing wrong with them .
i did try the flatbread breakfast pizza today though .
only takes one bad egg to ruin an omelette .
but the highlight was the biscuits and gravy .
very nice staff and excellent food !
lots of variety all with a mexican flair .
but the sushi really is the unique .
that ' s a fair response .
"unique , as in good ."
the sauce is great and the toppings are generous .
both locations are excellent .
very good and very unique .
"i recommend the egg , bacon , gouda pizza ."
it is not relaxing if screaming brats bothers you .
go off property to eat .
they could definitely improve this .
the food is excellent and the service is exceptional .
the worse was the sizzler .
. the ones going to auction .
... hmm ... no trade evaluation .
"average , overpriced , insincere ."
oh an la salsa charges for chips & salsa .
i talked to two servers and mike the owner .
had a great conversation .
pizza on a scale of 0-00 rates a 00 .
everything we had was great .
excellent bbq and great customer service .
the atmosphere was great though .
boneless wings had lots of great options as well .
be careful what you wish for .
would certainly come here again !
"pretentious , fake <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> ."
two stars for the two nice people working there .
this place has value .
i could n't pass up a rotating meal .
the meal was amazing .
i will never forget the lobster bisque .
just got quality paint .
"food , service , atmosphere ."
so far the best for the price .
i ' ll be going back again .
"everyone was courteous , professional and knowledgeable ."
i strongly recommend dave and christine and their staff .
hard not to be frustrated with this place .
you ' re a sports bar .
you ca n't screw up burgers .
"well , dude , it sucked ."
my wife ' s flatbread ?
keep the dollars local .
medium rare does not mean well done .
why bother to ask ?
this place is good for pouring cheap beer .
i strongly recommend these kind folks .
the quality and service was second to none .
this place was simply spot on .
the fries and onion rings were also good .
i will certainly return and strongly recommend the place .
over the top cheesesteaks .
"best in phoenix , perhaps the world ."
his mind reading <UNK> reason .
he makes you believe in magic .
highly recommend and will go again myself .

very happy that they opened this location .
very good deal for ayce $ 0.00 .
this place is ok .
good pizza and a few italian dishes / sandwiches .
but their food is good and they know pizza .
great place to eat .
staff is very friendly and the place looks great .
fries were stone cold .
' ' ramsay is there to take your money .
wife is pretty particular about her calzone .
great service from friendly staff .
back to the ticket counter .
ca n't help you .
this was my first visit to this location .
really probably 0.0 stars but i round up .
they took the car and i went inside .
the food is usually fine .
this review is for the service department .
as smooth as it gets .
very very good italian food .
never again will i fly us airways .
he was condescending and arrogant .
definitely worth a look .
cut is well worth the money .
"all i can say is , wow ."
nothing that blew me away .
first time @user boa .
i had the beef medallion special .
if there are delays you have very few options .
the experience above was our return flight .
great pizza finally available close to anthem .
i ' d suggest this company to absolutely anyone .
with a cold beer of course .
it was about 00 minutes till closing .
filthy and really no respect for a customer .
just had to have price corrected again .
the burger is pretty good .
lots of choices for the money .
well they brought out catfish instead of chicken .
at home now finishing the cooking myself .
got a great sandwich tonight .
he did it to be an asshole .
great way to loose a regular customer ... .
what a mess this place is .
they are charging more than advertised .
zero stars is way too much .
get treated bad every time i go here .
here for the big slab tuesday ' s deal .
service was friendly service an quick .
i have to give props to this place .
saigon bowl gets thumbs up from me !
the wings are great .
personally i prefer the medium or hot wings .
bbq is not something i grew up with .
the pork and chicken was moist and tender .
fast friendly service a little to fast .
awesome subs clean and friendly well priced .
$ 00 bucks for a 00 piece meal .
not a great deal on my book .
it was refused by the receiver .
wait time for an agent was 00-00 minutes .
this location is busy but not as bad .
i drank that down and then the wait begins .
i ordered the italian .
the things weighed 0 lbs at least .
so much for trying a new place .
well they were useless as well and would not .
bad bad bad food .
nice deep fried frozen pot stickers .
west valley people have zero taste buds .
salad was loaded with dry oregano .
what good veal is tough !
flavors are all great .
"great coffee , food , and pastries ."
they even have a nice craft beer selection .
it is my favorite place to eat in charlotte .
best mediterranean restaurant i have been to .
the employees make it that much better .
the best pho from a restaurant .
i will pay more to fly any other airline .
i happily took her up on that offer .
this glass of beer set things right .
i ' ve been to carne vino twice .
one drawback for some may be the prices .
the salads and sides are excellent .
one of the better steakhouses in las vegas .
the service was outstanding .
our waitstaff was headed by a very friendly woman .
the food was also outstanding .
everything was top notch .
it ' s baked fresh on premises and excellent .
my strip was fantastic .
all of the sides were excellent .
it felt like a real locals joint .
the reason for 0 stars is the service .
chips and salsa are outstanding as is the guacamole .
vibe is great and waitstaff are wonderful .
just a nice place to hang !
good beer and great nachos .
"great sandwiches , friendly service and right downtown ."
fast and well prepared subs .
friendly crew that work here as well .
it seemed to be fairly clean .
service was relatively quick but not at all friendly .
i ' ll try it again at some point .
service was very good .
he was actually serious .
the cheddar biscuits were great !
the brisket was decent .
instead of treating people as just another dollar .
they rush everyone so they can make another dollar .
the food is n't very good .
really bad service and my fajitas were overcook .
pittsburgh needs more places like this .
"great food , great atmosphere , and reasonable prices ."
be sure to make reservations .
best thai food i ' ve had in pittsburgh .
"really good food , reasonable price ."
i would recommend making reservations outdoors in nice weather .
that ' s when it becomes a disappointment .
"way to much , <UNK> ."
this place does things right .
she forgot the bread after several reminders .
the silverware was taken for no reason .
"0nd , what ' s the rush ?"
loved the photos they had on their overhead tv .
it felt like they were running past by us .
do i recommend them ?
would i recommend it to anyone ?
she asked if i want it cold or hot .
so i questioned the cashier .
it was washed down .
"i tasted mostly crushed ice , with some coffee ."
the alexis park resort was hosting meetings <UNK> .
who <UNK> up at 0:00 in the morning ?
the middle was for people to pass .
it was $ 0.00 of each plate .
they ' re only open till 0 pm .
always friendly with delicious meals .
large tv with sports channel on for sports enthusiast .
try this place out .
the last two ended up with a long line .
same quality and friendliness .
the price wo n't kill anyone .
. but i appreciate the comedy .
either you love the place or you dont .
the staff is very friendly .
very clean and friendly staff .
its not shea filibertos on the sign .
. ohhh <UNK> ' s drive-through and <UNK> ppl .
. thanks for the memories .
great service and the food is good .
never seen a bar fight here .
". what , free booze ."
it ' s location gets it a 0star .
one of the best restaurants in vegas .
food is great ... service is not-so-great .
i like scottsdale fashion square better to be honest .
"not a big deal , but it got worse ."
we ' ll see ... but probably not .
fun old time casino though .
$ 00 for the friday night buffet .
highly recommended for formal dining restaurant .
no high five for you .
i thought i had reviewed sp already .
"kids , got ta love em ' ."
or put them up for adoption .
wtf is that about ?

i live near by .
i love me some burritos .
i love me some carnitas burritos .
". well fried , not scrambled ."
"i have pizza <UNK> instead . , <UNK> ."
the <UNK> was empty .
i felt <UNK> after i ate it .
i did like the wobbly butcher block tables .
i see there are uncle louie haters .
you bet your ass i am .
is this gordon effing ' ramsay cooking here ?
is this a fair review ?
it ' s my review .
- rrb - but the service is unbelievably good .
well lets say <UNK> ... yeah .
"hook , line and <UNK> ."
this place is kinda dark inside .
i ' m writing this review are n't i ?
i even tried to substitute and the <UNK> refused .
"the thing is a religious experience , i swear ."
fyi there is no waiter service till 0:00 pm .
this is not a steak house .
"two different meats , one sammy ."
nothing to write home to mom about .
i will stick with uncle louie pizza up north .
holy crap their pizza is fucking good .
; i ' m fucked .
try their other locations aswell !
it was the equivalent to <UNK> oral sex .
i ' m psycho for this place .
damn it lux ... damn it .
not the case ; this place is <UNK> .
what did i eat ?
"massive , massive <UNK> my man ."
charlie has definetly secured this area .
please stop reading my yelp and go here .
"but go , and you shall be rewarded ."
<UNK> - hell no .
assuming it ' s still available .
"yeah , well fuck that <UNK> ."
"sauce is <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> even ."
i just stopped by for a quick iced coffee .
i had homemade ginger ale .
served with <UNK> ` <UNK> - lrb - sp ?
not the case here .
"fresh , tasty and reasonably priced ."
everything tasted fresh and was cooked to order .
"metro b , get your shit together ."
jesus h christ cracker and co . .
how dare you sir ; how .
to all of you over - easy haters .
"shut it , buy one and trust me ."

like they ' re freaking awesome sweet potatoe chips !
would i avoid this place ?
you can not beat it .
"and , they have <UNK> ' s bourbon ."
great sushi quality and reasonably priced .
my wife loved it .
"the tacos were only so-so , at best ."
good luck opening your new restaurant <UNK> .
jeff this is our favorite pizza place .
one of the best pizza places in the valley .
have a nice day .
the ramen noodle soups are very good as well .
this guy is a piece of work .
"great service , great meal ."
tried the friday prime rib special .
"total bill $ 000 + , will not return ."
veal parmigiana was superb .
"great service , food and prices ."
ask your primary care doctor .
how could this mistake have happened ?
it ' s may 00th .
"0-00- 00 , 0-00- 00 , and 0-00- 00 ."
i reported them to <UNK> member services .
already the best smog attendant i ' ve had .
i had no waiting for other cars .
hope you guys do well and stay in business .
hope to see you guys next year .
you guys know how you get down .
you could learn a lot from this place .
"yes , they ' re just that good ."
keep on doing what you do guys .
both times were great .
handicapped spaces are always open when i go there .
the ct scan attendant called me back with him .
"he was a hispanic male , bald headed ."
that made a big difference .
i ordered it with onion straws which were forgotten .
then i also ordered onion rings instead of fries .
do n't confuse if for <UNK> in chandler .
the pumpkin curry is definitely a recommendation .
it does n't get much more luxurious than this .
the steamed ones were dry and <UNK> over done .
definitely go someplace else .
even the most <UNK> sushi purist will approve .
very nice executive course .
the pro shop personnel were friendly .
great views from some of the holes .
could n't have asked for a better day golfing .
this course is good for all levels of play .
great place to work on the short game .
the service is good and the food is great .
what else could you want ?
he is an excellent waiter .
the busser paul was also very attentive .
my gf had the crabs legs and loved them .
"all in all , a great dining experience ."
also the coffee was really good .
we had a great meal here .
followed up to make sure the ants were gone .
folks you pay for what you get .
"great service , great food ."
"take 0 , top of our calzone black ."
seem like nice folks .
"we order pizza super combo , a sampler platter ."
and so my wife and i ate it .
"employees were great , management sucked at buffet though ."
the food was just ok .
i wont be going back .
unnecessary trip to go there anyway .
this manager was a big wig i guess .
even with that very enjoyable .
all the bartenders were very nice and knowledgeable .
the burger that i had was juicy and delicious .
great baseball at a reasonable price .
and i had a damn good time doing it .
it was well worth the trip .
but times have changed .
tickets for madison <UNK> games start at $ 0 .
the market circles the wisconsin state capitol .
"talk about a damn , fine breakfast ."
<UNK> is now our official breakfast restaurant of madison .
i would not want to go anywhere else .
c . r . had the atomic wings .
the wings are well worth the drive .
double double animal style and well done fries .
pastries and breakfast here is unreal .
go see bella at epic natural beauty studio salon .
you be glad you did .
"thanks , to michael a + + performance ."
"work was done on time , and hassle free ."
"would come again , but more likely for lunch ."
the wait staff in the casino area is great .
the staff is very nice and respectable .
i ' ll start with the exceptional service .
the servers really act as a team .
the timing of the meal was perfect .
the atmosphere of the restaurant is mixed .
"the food was very good , but not great ."
prices are a little high for pittsburgh .
this is a must in pittsburgh .
highly recommend this place .
"nice waitress though , and fairly clean space ."
"mgm grand is a very big , cool place ."
front desk crew was both efficient and extremely helpful .
bar service at the pools is excellent .
<UNK> <UNK> and a decent time was had .
what can you expect ?
"the rooms are small , the restroom are small ."
for the price it ' s ok .
i stayed <UNK> and house keeping never came .
definitely not worth the lower price .
ps the back room reeks .
yeah it was that bad .
. its like they are reading my mind .
the highlight of the night was the <UNK> <UNK> .
"the selection of <UNK> is great , too ."
let me start with the food .
this is my second time here .
the food is hit or miss .
i have a <UNK> relationship with this property .
had a really nice breakfast here .
had a truly exceptional <UNK> from commonplace this morning .
far and away the best coffee in town .
i have been to blt burger two times now .
it used to stretch around the block .
imagine a gourmet hot pocket .
the food here is serious stuff .
also of special mention is the pork jerky appetizer .
about the <UNK> butter fat content of their shakes .
but is it any good ?
you want bacon on that double bypass ?
then you get 00 slices .
there is a point of <UNK> returns .
the rigatoni with sausage was amazing .
the sauce was reduced to create a fantastic thickness .
"the tiramisu was acceptable , not great not bad ."
the server was named <UNK> and she was amazing .
thank you for a great meal .
environment and food were top notch .
the food here was great .
never ever have i left sober from here .
"both times , everything was top notch ."
you will not regret it .
all three were exceptional .
and it ' s not even overpriced .
kudos to kokomo ' s .
this place is amazing .
their installer juan was very knowledgable and experienced .
the place was mostly deserted .
the food was perfectly prepared and priced fairly .
what about the atmosphere ?
"there is some good news , however ."
the bad : 0 .
the good : 0 .
all over i ' d say this place failed .
but all in all its was n't bad .
but they did n't have any copies .
at least for the electronic department .
food finally showed up 0:00 minutes later .
food was average service was pleasant .
wrote concern to corporate and web .
no call and no return .
i would have expected some kind of personal contact .
good venue to watch a show .
that ' s the best place to be .
watch out for high concession prices !
this makes for the perfect combo in my eyes .
great park and also well maintained .
the food here was awesome !
maybe she was just having a bad day .
"no harm , no foul ."
we began with the calamari .
"it was good , slightly undercooked ."
shrimp was cooked <UNK> .
tsa gets you through security pretty quick .
my flights have almost always departed on time .
this place is fantastic on atmosphere alone .
i highly recommend the tom and jerry .
"a few <UNK> here , as well ."
"tennis courts , baseball fields ... a <UNK> course ?"
it was a great event .
"it seems inconsistent , leaning toward the lighter side ."
overall it was a pretty good experience .
is that the norm nowadays ?
my 0 enchiladas were absolutely awesome .
the fried calamari here was fantastic .
it was well seasoned and cooked just right .
maybe that ' s an authentic type thing ?
the lobster tail was cooked perfectly .
"when i get a steak , i want thickness ."
i highly recommend the general tsao ' s chicken .
"the waitress was polite , helpful , and attentive ."
great staff great tacos .
the f & b manager is doing it right .
great beer great service and go vikings .
keep doing it right gang .
this place is a pretty good little sub shop .
this place is worth checking out .
coffee is also great .
it ' s best to make a reservation .
"bottom line : good , but not great ."
"though in the past , their skate was incredible ."
so people know what ' s up .
i honestly did n't expect much from this lounge .
how nice is that ?
hopefully good service continues .
"<UNK> , especially for a chinese restaurant ."
the best part was the desert .
longest story ever shortened ?
once in afternoon and once at night .
"oh jeez , why ?"
only downside is you have to tip the valet .
yes it is just that good .
knew what he was doing .
"great facility , and even greater employees ."
will that keep me away from the hotel ?
more on this later .
did i already explain this ?
in a good way .
easiest smog check experience ever .
visited the place on a sunday for dinner .
too much $ $ for lunch .
great to take a date .
took my gf here for our anniversary .
sat out in the balcony overlooking the bellagio fountains .
affordable and decent quality food .
"good to take friends , date , coworkers ."
not the best place to take customers .
"good to take friends , date , coworkers ."
got ta love the crew at las vegas mini .
good food nice atmosphere and well executed .
food atmosphere service view all in one package .
and get the pork belly tacos .
did n't tell me about this place .
tl ; dr - incredible food .
"also , the knock off is choice ."
the course was great and the experience was awesome .
the best grass that i have ever played on .
the wet carne asada burrito was fantastic .
what can i say that has n't been said ?
"bravo , chef robuchon !"
lived up to all the hype !
"great service , great beer and great food !"
head to portillo ' s .
the fresh cut french fries are soggy .
clearly they do n't take criticism well .
that was their only flaw .
the only problem is trying to find it .
clean environment in case you want to dine in .
perfect spot for a quick work lunch .
will be coming back more often .
la fitness is a joke !
will never be going to an la fitness .
great wait staff ... great taste and full belly !
they have very authentic taco ' s .
this one lacks a bit .
they seem to draw in sports greats .
i met dick <UNK> last week in here .
<UNK> is the best fast food place .
they must have the biggest fast food menu ever .
would n't go back for the food .
very nice and trustworthy guest list .
the damage was extensive .
starting when <UNK> ford was on east sahara .
chris montana in finance .
all the best at what they do .
see dave when you want a great haircut .
"larry the owner did pass away , very sad ."
hopefully dave will get his act together .
franks in boulder city would be my next choice .
great food friendly staff .
still was worth the money and experience kudos .
000 % nice presentation .
great menu and awesome service .
did n't seem concerned about the smell .
"presentation , taste & food choices ."
not quite worth the $ .
she emphasized they closed exactly the posted time .
always friendly and the food is consistently good .
i am writing this for my wife melissa .
awesome dinner tonight with my wife .
always go here for quick <UNK> .
become a regular and it gets even better .
tucked away but well worth the find .
"friendly , clean and great value thai food ."
quality and freshness is never a disappointment .
just 0.00 and you leave feeling satisfied .
it meets all expectations from staff to equipment .
they sell thrifty ice cream as well .
this park is great .
there are better choices out there .
"great place , clean and friendly ."
greg the owner is a fantastic human being .
hands down better value over chipotle .
the staff is always pleasant and remembers my name .
not horrible for the entertainment that is provided .
they have great breakfast items and killer bloody <UNK> .
it ' s a solid bar with solid food .
there is a burger for every taste .
every burger i have had has been amazing .
you get three different burgers and fries .
get the twinkie shake .
where else can you dine next to flavor <UNK> ?
it ' s a franchise .
what a gem of a place .
went here after a friend recommended .
never had a problem before with the service .
a little more expensive compared to chipotle / qdoba .
they actually have a pretty good breakfast .

quote : nearly $ 00 .
this place is great and is a fantastic value .
they also have $ 0.00 shakes that look fantastic !
"really , really weak beer selection ."
quick review : it ' s pretty good .
i had a double cheese burger .
"the fries were hot , crisp and nicely seasoned ."
we ask which ones are on special .
the place kind of smelled like pee .
their website does not have their phone number .
their website does not have their address .
a real hardware store .
is it a bar ?
if you want a <UNK> while doing hula hoop .
what is this place ?
it ' s better than most take out pies .
why the low rating ?
the bill was several dollars more .
the menu is small but inspired .
"when we were seated , another couple was nearby ."
the service is kind of rough .
i ' ve never been a fan of changs .
nice local beers from phx ale !
"good , authentic ` ` <UNK> ' ' pies !"
"yes , i took away one more star ."
it really is the best sub chain around !
your tax dollar at work .
the gym is great and perfect for <UNK> workouts .
what ' s the problem ?
i ' ve been there probably 00 times .
the waitress clearly did not want to be there .
my wife was reading the beer menu .
the waitress asks me what beer i want .
i said ` ` what are these ?
* it ' s easily approached from holyrood house .
just climb the damn thing and enjoy that view .
"' ' attitude , but served us efficiently enough ."
made for a satisfying meal downtown .
"saw the scottish crown jewels , of course ."
"information , you will not lack it ."
the paint was top notch for a 0000 car .
i can count on dave .
' ' he ' s simply the best .
- bob m & <UNK> s .
keep up the great work ! !
lol to make this review short .
they called lowes and said lowes will call me .
especially the filipino guy .
but this from a ross store .
lol avoid this place if you can !
the oxtail chili cheese fries were pretty good .
what happens in vegas ... gets posted on yelp !
it ' s good but pricy .
"comfortable , clean and big rooms ."
"thanks again el <UNK> sol team , vince ."
you could get a bottle or bar tab .
she had no idea what was going on .
the manager apologized and said it was not acceptable .
everyone owes this place at least one visit .
lobster ravioli makes the trip worth it .
wine list was fair .
"cool atmosphere , good scene ."
burger was better than expected .
a must see for any hiker who visits carefree .
great service for fast food .
not in my top 00 for burger joints .
great food and great service by donna !
this review is for the hotel side of <UNK> .
it ' s the real deal .
they confirmed the price and time .
for two orders this went great .
my 0000 <UNK> needed a new hard drive .
i will be coming back here again .
do n't judge the place based on the looks .
. which is n't very hard .
"so , i have given up on bar marco ."
"in reality , it lacked on the execution ."
some of the dishes are really good .
even the sesame chicken .
shit filibertos is better than this place .
for being fast food chinese its pretty good .
there are much better pizza joints around .
everything about this place is fresh and quality ingredients .
maybe i went there on an off night ?
the pizza here is really good .
it has a real pizzeria feel to it .
but the pizza really is good .
there lunch specials are an awesome deal .
i go to this place a lot .
cool place to hang out and drink for awhile .
ca n't imagine going to vegas any other way .
overpriced in a town where that is expected .
food is good and so are the drinks .
really enjoy the food .
best thai food in the c-u area .
very good quality barbershop .
that time it only took 0 minutes to replace .
hard to justify almost $ 00 for casual dining .
does anyone know who owns this place ?
- lrb - texas can bite me .
and the wine selection was nice .
the stew was amazing .
the full breakfasts are n't bad either .
this is a local chain with locations everywhere .
"so , it was a little tough ."
we were expecting grilled prawns on a tostada .
"still , good place ."
this place is the best sushi house in mesa .
", you ca n't be serious ?"
the overall experience was extremely pleasant .
the wait staff is friendly and attentive .
chris did a killer job !
chips and salsa were great though .
better burger options in the burgh .
we both received diet .
not even an overly good sandwich at that .
the chicken taco : <UNK> might be right .
this guy was a master of his craft .
i did have one issue with the steak though .
the rating : was it filling ?
: i had 0 tacos and was pretty full .
in once instance it almost killed me .
the lamb was perfectly juicy and nicely seasoned .
the rating : was it filling ?
it has been weeks and zero contact from firestone .
the ingredients are fresh and the burgers on point .
that sums up my thought on this place .
chicken tenders on the kids menu were excellent .
this place is not fast .
did n't try the sushi .
i guess that was about a fair price .
the noisy ac masked the freeway noise .
full disclosure : i ' m from florida .
food is very good and not outrageous price .
bellagio is a great place .
lobby and pool are great as well .
after disputing it with corporate hertz it was fixed .
i would will use others .
great beer and pizza is to die for .
my complements to the chef !
truly worthy of 0 stars .
"otherwise , all good ."
my belgian style bacon waffle was perfect !
great coffee and great breakfast for under $ 0 .
we can no longer order a pint of beer .
it ' s either 00 or 00 oz .
both clerks were nice and helpful .
what a poorly ran bar .
the fries are great fresh cut natural potatoes .
the food has been spot on .
"respect the light , krispy kreme !"
"well , i do n't drink beer ."
i found the atmosphere great .
the <UNK> chili had a great flavor .
and of course ... the pazookie .
pros : - the food is good .
cracker ' s is the breakfast spot to visit .
avoid using them under any circumstance .
great way to beat the desert heat !
i am done with cut rate insurance companies .
they are good people .
it ' s really an impressive array of work .
this is a great gym with excellent trainers .
good local joint for breakfast !
"for eating , the food is pretty weak ."
but this place is much better just for drinking .
this place is great .
it was pretty good overall .
i think over an hour the most recent time .
did you go to an sec school ?
do you remember <UNK> ' s ?
service at mr smoke shop is awesome .
they also have drinks and a variety of munchies !
- rrb - and after as well .
the chicken was way overdone and dried out .
the bacon is awesome here !
alabama shakes and some craft beer !
solidly fresh fish here and quick service .
then get your ass to <UNK> !
"this is solid , inexpensive , and fresh stuff !"
now this is a legit dive .
overall a really solid burger .
head towards your <UNK> left exit .
always somebody down there doing something .
grab some oxtail soup .
service was bad but soup was great !
but do n't let the photos fool you .
a meal unto itself .
only one left is the plaza .
she recommended a popular pizza called the cal italia .
the combination works <UNK> .
ashley noticed i did n't finish my crust .
try this place out .
friendly crew working the counter as well .
but i guess fire <UNK> are relative .
it was also very good .
you pay at the cashier on your way out .
"perhaps still moving , even looking at me ."
' ' <UNK> the ox would ask .
no big deal really .
just watch out for that ox .
imagine explaining that one when you get back home .
"well , watch out vic ' s ."
just go up the escalators and hang a right .
"it ' s <UNK> discrimination , i tell ya ."
most of the restaurant was empty at this point .
oh speaking of the meal .
this is due to its design .
less <UNK> of utensils and <UNK> .
so my hats off to <UNK> ' s .
that was a high bar to reach .
congrats to the d !
may check it out again on my next trip .
five star service at every turn .
i open my own doors .
coming out for a smoke ?
interested in a cigar ?
the biltmore shopping center is right across the street .
excellent dogs at a cheap price .
they do have drinks and fries available .
the dining room is as exquisite as they come .
we capped it off with an amazing dessert .
how nice is that ?
no rush at all .
might try lunch or dessert next time .
the door itself seems vintage 0000 .
hats off to whoever prepared this marketing piece .
' ' in a good way .
just about 00 min to airport via taxi .
ordered room service one morning ... most excellent .
good advice in any town .
"thanks for the great stay , renaissance ."
i ' ll be back soon .
i never met this <UNK> arrogant butcher .
large enough to make a meal .
the name of the place is easy to remember .
but this is good .
please use it <UNK> .
it ' s a world unto itself .
this is a place where laptops and tablets abound .
and what an eclectic crowd it is .
"a tourist , no doubt ."
you would n't see this at the ritz .
that ' s when the shouting begins .
went with the fremont slice which was excellent .
you ' ll see what i mean .
stayed two nights here just to try it .
"overall , it was a good stay ."
i shave my head .
but i found navigating the bathroom extremely challenging .
i slept well here .
chocolate chip cookie excellent .
"the tgif menu is the standard , familiar one ."
service here is impeccable and the view great .
i ' m a fan .
"very large slices abound , here ."
"they heat them up for you , too ."
my personal recommendation is the bbq chicken pizza .
and ate it back in my hotel room .
like a sad <UNK> guy .
so i wo n't hold that against them .
"once for lunch , once for dinner ."
unless they hired a german cook .
"and tempe , az , keeps the tradition alive ."
no charge for this entertainment .
"- rrb - , including tacos and enchiladas ."
full bar and indoor seating as well if desired .
friendly staff each visit .
i believe you ' ll also become a fan .
check-in is always prompt and courteous .
a throwback to the better days in vegas .
meeting rooms were very nice with outdoor entrances .
he raised his voice ` ` sir !
they came out quickly and were excellent .
this is a nice lounge to people watch .
servers were all great as was the food .
i meant to but forgot on my way out .
this is one of them .
you wo n't be disappointed .
so i ' m a fan .
it was outstanding in every respect .
they looked pretty good .
you pay for any ingredients above three but hey !
they were quite large .
"and very good , too ."
then triple that in size .
so you could easily make this a meal .
and it was all outstanding !
large place with tons of indoor and outdoor seating .
both were absolute five star dishes .
i ' d give it six stars .
even more than that broccoli guy .
it is a supreme steakhouse .
just hanging out in this unique showroom was fun .
just be prepared for a visual feast .
but unique does not necessarily equal positive .
same with the fries .
you ' ll thank me later .
that ' s why i keep coming back .
but it ' s legit .
typical <UNK> transit vehicle .
and it does n't make too many stops .
but this is a good thing .
the food is excellent .
my wife opted for a pepperoni pizza .
this was a nice touch .
they just forgot to take it out .
and did not burn this one .
the pizza was average but not bad .
he and his image are quintessential vegas .
i had to try his steakhouse .
service can only be described as short and surly .
the dining area over looks the fremont street experience .
the theme was fun .
but it gets even better .
where else can you get that ?
my personal favorite : the cowboy omelette .
still many good items on the menu .
so what can i comment on ?
most seemed to be in a <UNK> place .
check it out for the uniqueness if nothing else .
the food is excellent .
first class act all around .
there is a $ 00 daily resort fee .
this basically gives you the use of their gym .
you ' ll see a connection .
now back to the meal .
customer service here is outstanding .
' ' end of story .
service was also very good .
"both times , it was a truly outstanding experience ."
fig & prosciutto it is .
you could almost make a meal of these .
the atmosphere here is outstanding as well .
the food is great as well .
will never miss when i ' m in town .
we ' re off to a great start .
"the food is good too , though ."
: - rrb - nice touch .
"well now , i ' m glad too ."
the manager ' s cool .
the environment very comfortable .
maybe it ' s just a quiet monday .
definitely worth a visit if you ' re downtown .
completely upgraded casino and check-in area .
"unique and , well , long ."
great place for watching your favorite sporting events .
the absolute best steakhouse i ' ve visited anywhere .
worth a special trip .
but it ' s a paid upgrade now .
"come on , guys !"
as in for a <UNK> ?
i guess it was just a matter of time .
i also experienced one of these .
i place the odds at about 00 % .
elevators are fast and kind of entertaining inside .
it truly is wasted on the young .
"perhaps a somewhat slower , more laid back pace ."
enjoyed this place and will definitely be back .
mediocre coleslaw and passable fries ; $ 00 .
order ahead to avoid lines .
great croissants with reasonably good espresso .
"good food , but not so good service ."
the gladly is an excellent addition to the area .
gladly service was excellent - top notch all around .
cowboy ciao just gets it right .
there ' s no one better in town .
let me tell you : i was completely impressed .
you ' ll be glad you did .
"everything was full of flavour , using great ingredients ."
but a decent selection of canned beers .
they just need to cut out the weird crap .
which was then very slowly refilled .
that is all you need to know .
and they use copper pipes as <UNK> .
a little over priced .
i ' ll give them kudos for that .
i have been there three times .
not a place i will return to .
and my roommates order was wrong .
and he got asparagus mixed into all his noodles .
outright calling me a liar as i see things .
i arrived for lunch around 00 o'clock .
the server jacob was excellent .
"i offered to hold , and was promptly forgot ."
overall i would not recommend eating here for anyone .
fries are a must order .
found another vegan spot to eat at in vegas .
you will not be disappointed .
"live music , video jukebox , and great atmosphere ."
personally i love the burgers and the pulled pork .
<UNK> can do better .
"best pho in vegas , hands down !"
this place excelled in all three areas .
first the service was excellent .
what more could a guy ask for ?
0/0 for the value .
i also judge beans and some carb .
just a highly salty rub and grill time .
"again , nothing special ."
really feel the therapy working .
our bartender chad was great and on point .
00 min i ' m on mill .
my buddy had cigar that he wanted to smoke .
"great dish btw , it delivered and was bomb ."
"for me , no complaint ."
honest good practice in tempe that i highly recommend .
this place is a true culinary inspiration .
la <UNK> is amazing .
this is a dump !
far far far better place !
lunch specials are good and cheap .
front desk staff is cool .
i have been there a few times .
lots of different specials though out the week .
it is a lot of fun .
its great for locals and tourist .
"however , the bar service is the worst ever ."
great stop while in the phoenix area .
great breakfast option in the united terminal .
the food was 0 stars .
women are not attractive and staff is even worse .
just had my 0th meal here .
update or upgrade your system ! !
bbq is okay at best .
chicken is second to none .
i would recommend this place to anyone who asked .
the holes are pretty interesting good difference in holes .
the service was also excellent .
great show for all ages .
the atmosphere here has changed for the negative .
the rest have n't a clue about customer service .
0 plates and 0 bites is n't a meal .
what a great mediterranean food place .
will be coming back in the near future .
` ` you know where the store is right ?
"well she did just that , nothing else ."
<UNK> did n't give me any <UNK> .
such an interesting concept .
highly recommended for all .
the owner was on top of it .
"professional , delicious , affordable and memorable ."
excellent self-service car wash .
shea was very knowledgeable about the city .
which was complete bs .
what a cool little place .
it ' s hard to explain .
"i ' m tall , but no giant ."
0 - rrb - the <UNK> price .
this was a great hotel to stay at .
let ' s get to the good stuff .
the real kicker came at check out .
as i see the <UNK> lines moving quickly .
00 seconds later i was checked out .
highly recommended for a special treat .
their jumbo burrito should be called baby burrito .
and the new id law is stupid !
this is a three star hotel all the way .
the lamb is good .
the ramen broth is good .
the cons are avoid the prime rib and sushi .
"also , the service was very poor ."
the drinks did n't arrive for 00 minutes .
just more concerned about the management .
our night at <UNK> was outstanding .
the service was friendly and easygoing .
cool lasers too once the dj starts .
their marinade for the meat is perfect .
everyone here is nice enough and professional .
this is gon na be a rage review .
some of the best indian food in montreal .
"the <UNK> samosas are incredible , simply amazing ."
"well done , honest food in a family-run restaurant ."
meat is very well seasoned .
most importantly food is very well priced .
gyros are great too and lots of authentic dishes .

fair and honest and a decent guy .
kind of place you want to support .
go for the curry - service was excellent .
probably the best pancake i ever had .
coffee good diner style .

buffalo chicken sandwich was pretty good too !
i wo n't eat anything from china .

tasty beer selection and the burritos are amazing !
great people to do business with .
i found the food to be great .
i can only reiterate what the other reviewers posted .
i called john for the second time .
the problem this time was a bad blower fan .
"after his repair , the unit is running great ."
i will surely be back to buy from you .
this is very nice shop .
the service there is very friendly .
the food is solid pub grub .
stay away ! ! ! corporate <UNK> .
"chicken sandwich = very good , came with fries ."
the turnaround time was incredible .
place has changed though overtime .
this place is absolutely fantastic .
"everything was superb , highly recommended !"
bartenders and even the hostess were rather inattentive .
not many options - rrb - .
"great food , great service , great everything ."
"also , just so you know , its byob ."
warning : desert and food preparations are big !
right next door to lost leaf .
probably the best coffee in phoenix .
this place is tight .
good music for the most part .
great staff and great food .
. food was amazing .
a great ayce sushi spot for the price .
. but i eventually found them .
. as i went inside .
. the food was amazing .
. food was amazing .
. service was great .
they cleaned my 0 guns for free after shooting .
had a great experience overall .
what can i say that has n't been said .
multiple ingredients that go perfectly together .
decent pulled pork sliders as well .
service has always been excellent .
had hawaiian flatbread which was fair at best .
do n't waste your time waiting the 00mins .
you would do better at pizza hut .
took forever to get it .
amazing ! ! ! this is a great place .
"cheap , very good food ."
"they are all great , talkative , and friendly ."
it ' s hit or miss with the blackjack .
they have good delivery times and prices .
this review is for the parts department only .
terrible customer service in the parts department .
total waste of time at this place .
they come from the ashley signature design line .
on delivery day is when the trouble started ... .
the food was fantastic and reasonably priced .
"the food , overall , was very good ."
"my wife got her usual , insalata di <UNK> ."
i liked the hyundai <UNK> that i rented .
here are some things you should know : 0 .
too bad they had pepsi instead of coke products !
it tasted great even without the jalapeã ± o .
magnificent red gloss painted trim .
airport bar with tvs on every wall .
we had four entrees and they all very poor .
best rooms in las vegas .
shopping nearly as good as wynn and <UNK> .
but the food certainly is not worth the visit .
had the sunday special .
i went from weighing 000 lbs to 000 lbs .
todd english needs to <UNK> the direction of olives .
the tacos al pastor are amazing .
"excellent service , great people , reasonable prices ."
you ca n't beat that kind of <UNK> .
late night taco run anyone ?
very similar to frozen custard from back east .
the sausage and cabbage was a joke .
i am going to keep this review simple .
warning - you are going to leave hungry .
never had a burger like that .
everything at the restaurant is great .
i would recommend this place to all .
we also got the lobster .
everything was fresh and everything tasted great .
super fast service with quality food .
try this place you wo n't regret it .
best tacos in phoenix !
great flavors in the carne asada .
you think pizzeria bianco is the best ?
generous size portion of meat in each sandwich .
quick place to grab a bite during lunch .
"outdoor only , nice patio seating ."
can it be more difficult to locate ?
they were disappointing to say the least .
the mussels were much the same .
the collard greens were very very salty and <UNK> .
he is a really nice guy to .
this place is well placed away from the strip .
kinda of set the mode already .
it was like my wife made it also .
but not to jam on buddy over his place .
hope this helps you guys out .
i recommend sean who was the sommelier .
my wife and i split the smoked gouda burger .
so were the onion rings .
always super professional and proficient .
always know where they are going .
fun to ride in a cab .
that makes it super easy .
she was very attentive and did it almost immediately .
"however , my approval of this restaurant ends there ."
"finally , food started coming out ."
people were getting their nigiri and some rolls .
each had their own special flavor and unique taste .
i have been going to stand-up scottsdale for years .
service is always good .
great food and lively atmosphere .
they significantly overcook their shrimp .
the restaurant has some great food .
overall this is a good resorts / hotel .
lobster was perfect and the bread was excellent .
fast service and great hospitality great food excellent service .
nice views from seating area .
really great setup nice friendly staff .
highly recommend the carne asada tacos .
best tacos i have ever had .
what a bunch of clowns .
"awesome menu , good prices and super nice staff ."
huge sushi portions as well .
the giant roaster is a cool sight as well .
not a good sign on the weekend .
very clean and well kept .
staff was quite friendly .
this place is 0 stars all the way .
anybody that knows me knows that i can eat .
i eat there every week .
everything i have had is very good .
most of the time i stay at the orleans .
minutes but 0 polite maintenance workers came up .
they fixed it easily .
bottom line is that i will go back .
"had fish and chips , wife had mushroom burger ."
both average at best .
taco bell blows it away .
been there twice now .
great food and friendly staff .
my personal favorite is the <UNK> gyro .
fried dumplings : bland and tasteless .
miso soup : ok .
brown rice : nothing special .
well worth the 000 yard walk from the courtyard .
great atmosphere and prices .
i ' ll review that place later !
i guess i was stupid not to ask .
"not a fan , bordering on 0 star ."
"the food is good , very good ."
you do not leave here hungry .
you should never trust this company .
if only i found beer palatable .
check this place out .
you ' ll be glad you did .
is there a better sandwich on the market ?
"excellent flavor , subtle heat , perfectly cooked ."
what else can you ask for ?
that was in 0000 .
it ' s french bistro done right .
the food is excellent .
a bit pricey for burgers but well worth it .
that is not the buffet at the aria .
this is top shelf cuisine .
went in for dinner this evening .
"a long wait , for average food at best ."
would not go back and would not recommend .
why did i give this pizza hut 0 stars ?
0 - rrb - pizza is consistently great .
what else can really be said ?
everything else was spot on though .
so i might try them again .
. assuming to log into their register .
. while i stand there .
. a business ' s first impression .
. need to work on being <UNK> .
. the carbonara came out .
. very poor presentation .
. looked like a sample amount .
every dish is unbelievable .
highly highly highly recommend .
the atmosphere was good .
each bite was a bit harder then the last .
the food is outstanding .
"i wont be back here again , ever ."
can one give less that 0 star ?
carpets are dingy and smells like old beer .
no wonder they are lacking for customers .
"food is great , local style ."
just what the dr . ordered .
looking for a good diner style breakfast ?
this place is all of that .
cost is reasonable as well .
"service slow , food edible but not outstanding ."
the italian hoagie is tremendous .
the place is a small mom and pop deal .
"great food , friendly staff ."
many small places like this do n't .
a salad is like public television .
that ' s a good sign .
this is a place i hope succeeds .
fortunately the kids like it too .
you got a problem with that ?
i do n't the prices are fair .
the food is above par .
hr professionals should have to study their hiring practices .
they are the platinum level .
nice small bit authentic setting .
i can make a better cup at home .
there are several within walking distance .
this ai n't it .
the burrito was almost flat ... almost nothing inside .
the service was attentive and eager .
this is my new go-to place for mediterranean food .
best place i ' ve found in the valley .
the atmosphere is cool as others have mentioned .
it was attentive and sufficient .
i had the mexican mule .
the place is an overall great addition to gilbert .
i ' ll be back to spend real money .
"first , the burritos are small ."
it would solve the bland problem .
apparently their equipment broke down .
could n't find it anywhere .
wow what a great place .
there steaks are amazing .
the prime rib is just the best .
great place this is a great location .
some of the foods are bland and need flavor .
i will return to dealer .
they all are great to work and deal with .
they knew the menu front and back .
like wtf ? ! you ca n't be serious .
the tortillas were even more of a big joke .
i do recommend the house steak however .
over all do n't get there fajitas .
outstanding food and service and <UNK> with local brew !
i came in for a simple oil change .
you wo n't be disappointed .
a butcher shop downstairs and dining upstairs .
this was my first visit here .
. it ' s casual dining .
my parents taught me when i was four .
water pressure is pretty weak as well .
' ' get over the buffet lady .
"their wine list sucks , too ."
the main server was exceptional .
"no <UNK> for me , just something to consider ."
what you get in a aaa five diamond restaurant .
mastros should be proud .
this is even more rare than great food .
give this place a try .
the owners are actually japanese .
great people watching for sure .
"this is an old review , read below ."
i <UNK> on the updating review option .
the service goes right along with the food .
pay attention folks ... .
house sake and bud lite .
what are you waiting for ?
"see lisa , k review below ."
$ 0.00 for an 00 ounce glass ... .
"ok , here is my humble opinion ."
you wo n't have that problem here .
you can also get a rib / chicken combo .
everything was actually very good .
try the bone in ribeye ... .
"enjoy great looking place , great sevice ."
food expensive and very small portions .
it ' s a taqueria in a latino supermarket .
nothing special but you have choices .
they will have just about everything you may like .
shame on the koi management .
barely average at best .
limited menu and dingy inside .
let ' s make this simple .
it ' s good average asian food .
"what a beautiful place inside , simple yet elegant ."
"avoid this place yelper ' s , avoid it ."
"wow , very interesting ."
she certainly <UNK> someone there in scottsdale .
certainly worth the drive off the strip .
"large place , clean and plenty of parking ."
huge tequila bar too .
just not very good .
i ' ve been going here since 0000 .
you will almost never have thai food like this .
nothing is cheap in vegas .
this place is just fine .
you will have a decent breakfast .
top shelf all the way .
worst experience ever getting an oil change .
never again quaint little place with awesome food .
"the wait staff was knowledgeable , prompt and courteous ."
i called up and talked to chance .

this review is for the sam bok food stand .
this place is simple .
you should too ... you wo n't regret it .
the owners are off the boat greek .
"it ' s well marinated , and freshly grilled ."
m & t tends to char theirs too much .

m & t use frozen bagged fries .
the fries are the deciding factor between the two .
i promise that you wo n't be disappointed .
000 different beers over 0 drunken hours .

your space lends itself to the title .
the queso and guacamole were crowd <UNK> .
i would go with the queso before the salsa .
the chips were impressive and unique .
kudos for having local beers on taps .
a large parking lot was a huge plus .
"lastly , service was prompt and friendly ."
a southern restaurant without the southern charm .

i hope it ' s ongoing .
most are all mothers and would never hurt anyone .
my preferred lady is ann .
it is located in the town square shopping plaza .
the prices may be a little intimidating .
i dropped off my dog and everything went fine .
she came in and handed me my paperwork .
we ate here sunday for breakfast .
. no prices on the drink menu either .
never calling these folks again .
they tried sucking every cent out of me .
this is somewhat different from your typical cirque show .
pricey and extremely slow .
shrimp pasta was meh .
"awesome staff , great scene ."
pepperoni and meatball pizza was awesome .
they have the slowest delivery time .
i have n't seen her in 0 years .
"friendly , efficient , great food ."
cornhole and guinness what more could a man want ?
great bar to chill outside and grab a pint .
this one is by far the worst .
not main stream and still focusing on quality .
". <UNK> in a pita , no spicy mustard ."
great pasta salad and sweet tea that rules !
why only 0 stars then ?
went to heritage last night with much anticipation .
great food and an amazing atmosphere !
waiter a little slow was only problem .
* enough closet space for <UNK> marcos .
* coffee bar featuring jamaica blue mountain beans .
<UNK> will leave a lasting impression .
do n't go if you hate kids .
it ' s a gambling <UNK> of sorts .
here ' s a classic vegas story .
a true story and tragedy of sorts .
blocks of people packed like sardines .
next step was to get to an er .
rating : the most dimly lit one star possible .
all you can eat breakfast .
"never a bad meal , amazing service ."
everyone working there was a dude .
the food was ok at best .
best bbq in town in the best hood !
it seemed like a half order with terrible presentation .
great store and amazing staff .
"bad beer , always slow and old games ."
let ' s hope something good goes in .
"no , maybe moderately bad ."
sandwich arrives much later .
the british open was on the tv .
that ' s pretty solid .
i thought it was a joke .
give up on your new <UNK> league lunch .
i want the garage to do well .
"first off , the garage has good <UNK> ."
we had wings and truffle oil deviled eggs .
"overall , food was better than most ."
why do some cool places slip up on this ?
empty beer and water glasses .
"yelp , you steered me wrong ."
this is just mediocre food in an odd location .
i have had the lunch pulled brisket twice .
lunch was less than $ 00 with h0o .
it was very good and not too spicy .
$ 00 for two at lunch .
"however , la <UNK> was right in my <UNK> ."
i could n't touch it for 00 mins .
i ' ll be back .
flauta was better than average .
beans and rice were excellent and homemade as well .
"$ 00 food , tax , tip ."
this is a great school .
we finished dinner as the live music was starting .
i had the lamb shepherds pie .
not one receipt left .
i explained again what the problem was .
the dinners are very good and huge .
awesome craft beer / wine selection .
bbq sauce is not very spicy .
service was slow and inattentive .
jack daniel ' s pecan pie is very good .
chocolate cream pie was just ok .
this place is a typical greasy spoon .
"mostly previously frozen , costco junk food ."
the small bowl of pho was <UNK> .
everything was very good .
everything about that place sucks .
"val was super friendly , fast , and professional ."
she significantly enhanced the experience without over <UNK> it .
ordering and the wait were quick .
the service was good and the menu looked great .
it was not a full cornish hen .
it was not a half cornish hen .
it was a 0/0 cornish hen .
plus there are prostitutes everywhere outside .
i would avoid this hotel .
"cool place to work , and have great coffee ."
it was not worth the original 00 dollars charged .
moved on to the gyros platter .
accented by a coco <UNK> from noda .
great service and food .
just a cool place .
this is a great place with a wonderful staff .
"the pizza , salads and burgers are fantastic ."
"sushi and burgers , what else can want ?"
first stop after a 0 hour bus ride ?
"bachi burger , man they did n't disappoint ."
started with the oxtail chili fries .
all served on an awesome toasted bun .
"start at bachi burger , its a slam dunk !"
tried the 0.00 steak and eggs .
all of the above ?
service is good and ambiance was nice .
also a root beer .
service sucked because the place was understaffed .

the best sauce anywhere especially the spicy variety
excellent food and service .

it made me want to throw up and leave .
excellent fresh fish and great service .
you will not be let down .

i am a certified master bbq <UNK> judge .
got to the site at 00:00 already packed .
the owner over sees all the carving and orders .
all were way above the norm .
the pork ribs were the weakest .
it pays to start with prime cuts .
i am a master bbq <UNK> judge .
long line with one register open .
two brisket sandwiches and side with drinks 00 bucks .
they were either to hot or to bland .
no wood smoke or flavor .
brisket it better than competition cooking .
ribs are great pulled pork also .
"over priced , average service ."
nothing special with the food .
bland and typical micro waved food .
get costco carry out instead .
simply a bad place .
beer cold food needs some work .
the worst kfc i have ever been to .
the gravel parking lot has ample spots .
the french onion soup is a must !
$ 00 gets you a brief intro .
the 0.0 % <UNK> is the sole dark beer .
they have complimentary popcorn and peanuts .
got a mesh fence installed with sure guard .
like that it is family owned and operated .
the worst service period .
nothing tasted super fresh and delicious .
they dont just have your basic continental breakfast .
they ' ll make you 0 pancake .
mine was brown sugar and banana pancake .
the surroundings are kinda farmhouse meets modern life ?
for the price you pay i love this place .
they also have really tasty wonton soup .
i would imagine it ' s like this .
and man is it good but stupidly filling .
service here is usually great .
the coleslaw with the hot pastrami was really good .
and i ' m usually not a coleslaw fan .
all the waitress ' s look like hotel maids .
service was mediocre at best .
"overall great restraunt , good quality food ."

makes a fat man die happy right there .
fuck their hot dogs .

i liked this place a lot .
they <UNK> some really cheap liquor to .

theres no <UNK> back .
i ' m a fan .
this thing was a monster .
this burrito is 0 meals for me .
the staff was very friendly .

not much to say really .
just your basic chicken and fries basket .
holy moly this thing is solid .
the <UNK> here is really good .
this place was not particularly appealing to me .
that is not the case here at teharu sushi .
the atmosphere is great .
"even better , the food here is amazing ."
"furthermore , the food here is amazing ."
but this one was excellent .
and that was the right choice .
"i sampled the chicken strips , buffalo style ."
cole slaw was ok .
<UNK> things did not go well .

you earned this five star rating ! !
the food was very good and the service excellent .

came to see a band play .
i have like 00 .
it was quite the backdrop .
wow to the venue itself .
wow am i happy this place exists .
this place has ` it ' .
or how about some chips and salsa ?
the dumplings are also a high contender .
too bad it does n't quite fit the bill .
had to ask for refills .
i had the sunrise burger .
. <UNK> are smart that way - rrb - .
you will be glad you did .
bravo to whoever <UNK> up the place .
all is great here .
this is where st . <UNK> disappoints .
food was priced very well .
"the entree was portioned fairly well , also ."
i found the bill more than fair .
organic meat ca n't be beat .
and the weary traveler does just that .
and that to me is a successful business .
a pig in a fur coat has completed me .
started with the duck fat fries .
everything here is in a perfect medium .
portions are fit to price .
much cheaper than <UNK> .
i give them mad props .
their award for best wait staff ?
"great service , food , atmosphere , and location ."
i can never make my mind up .

this place is like subway or chipotle .
great indoor / outdoor microbrewery in south scottsdale .
guest beers as well .
thrill bikes is a mobile bike mechanic .
it can get busy during lunch time .
green chile is excellent .
parking is across the street and convenient .
i stayed at the aria a few weeks ago .
the rooms were comfortable .
you either took the elevator or the escalator .
i enjoyed the experience .
this is an interesting little place .
nice chunks of pot roast and various cheeses .
i figured that this would be something different .
i also tasted my friends steak hoagie .
pittsburgh has a great downtown .
it made for a good time .
this is a great place for breakfast .
all for like $ 00 .
overall the price is fantastic for the quality .
it is resort prices but again was very tasty .
"plus , wine pairings that were phenomenal ."

cash only is a bit hard to swallow .
i moved to scottsdale in may .
looking forward to a repeat visit .
the pasta on the menu was much better .
i had fish tacos that were excellent .
service was nice but not real fast or efficient .

so many great things about this place .
service was good by vegas standards .
tried some more traditional fare at book club .
we need to find a better local place .
i look forward to another visit with a group .
i hope even <UNK> will give it a chance .
a great place to take visitors .
the service was attentive but not necessarily smooth .
the beet salad was very good .
the artichoke au gratin was fantastic !
the pecan tart was very good .
the pizza is dry .
we do n't double cut any pizzas .
wine and drinks proved to be impressive as well .
i had listed 0/0 as the pick up date .

easily serves 00 people .
i enjoy the pizza sauce and they deliver .
two <UNK> will feed four to six hungry adults .

great place to take family .
great place to stay .
good food just on the expensive side .
great service and great tasting food .
we love the steak and ribs that they serve .
as for the food .
there are two different places to park .
i came here last year during the nfl season .
the food is nothing special .
when you ' re in arizona during <UNK> baseball .
i remember coming here during the nfl season .
simply the best coffee in montreal .
not bad for airport food .
i had the tuna which was ok .
"most importantly , the food is amazing ."
great experience and excellent smoothie .
food was fairly good .
desert menu is really good too .
the cream corn was excellent .

first timer based on a friends recommendation .
0000 % better than the old one .
this place is sexy .
i was looking for the best burger in vegas .
the tater tots were portioned for two .
the food is outstanding .
cool lobby bar in palms .
"another lv casino , another expensive restaurant ."
mix is your standard high-end french lv restaurant .
but i can comment on the experience overall .
i ' ve been eating it for years .
the service is generally very friendly and competent .
prices are <UNK> for las vegas .
the cost is $ 00 .
nice arena to see a suns game at .
"nice facility , crappy tour ."
simple but good chinese food .
can be pricey but well worth it .
great indian food ; spiced well and not americanized .
we were there on 0/00 / 00 .
check out was worse .
it is small and the equipment is old .
"<UNK> , it was awesome ."
this place is awesome .
italian sausage was loaded with pepper .
not a big deal just thought it odd .
the rest of us got assorted hoagies .
plenty of craft beers and huge patio .
kitchen open till 0 friday and saturday .
total old school mom and pop diner .
seems like a place for a much older crowd .
absolutely love their hoagies .
"huge , greasy and cheap ."
best pizza in pittsburgh .
great old school owner as well .
assuming you enjoy their sweet sauce .
never had anything bad here .
side note the fries look burnt but are great .
such a stupid thing .
modern food is like modern art .
then start jamming people into corners .
not with the entree ' !
what more could you ask for .
"i ' m thinking ` yeah , sure pal ."
' ' and in walks the attorney general .
"ok , no big deal , stuff happens ."
just a we ' ll take care of it .
but it gets worse .
skip forward to june of this year .
back to bjs i go .
showed up tues at 0 for dinner .
and how do you screw up refried beans ?
the one disappointment was extremely slow service .
they seemed to be somewhat short staffed .
and it is tiny .
my companion had dijon tilapia .
"really good food , really slow service ."
prices are reasonable and the portions are size able .
i ordered a gyro plate and a baklava .
i needed a single tire .
the tire was done .
got some free tickets to the authority zero show .
then i guess the ac broke .
dudes were pissing on the side of a building .
the place has nice sound though .
selection is good though .
they have a great selection of mods .
dude helping me out was great .
felt bad i interrupted his game of cod zombies .
highly recommend you go there .
it ' s basically $ 0-0 .
` ` tasty ' ' is accurate .
my second visit improved my memory of this place .
really bad restaurant experience .
the best part is that the food is superb .
mixed feelings about this place .
places like this reflect bad on caesars too .
all you can eat for 00 $ .
the prices are reasonable and competitive .
"they serve small food appetizers , and alcoholic drinks ."
this place is freaking legit .
the food this valentine ' s was very good .
did i say that already ?
portion sizes were very big and good .
food was hot and perfectly cooked .
"good food , great prices - nice relaxed atmosphere ."

and on the strip .
this meatloaf was awesome .
"it was juicy , tender and tasty ."
these guys were huge .
- new england clam chowder in a bread bowl .
this is what my gf ordered .
how the mighty have fallen .
it should have been like how i remembered it .
the rooms here are pretty nice .
that was a nice touch .
maybe ti is due for an overhaul soon .
maybe they are n't .
i wo n't waste another minute writing this review .
burn it to the ground .
the locker rooms were insanely clean and well kept .
"sadly , the 00 minutes expired way too fast ."
the breadsticks were perfect as they always are .
the soup was awesome .
it was all very satisfying .
holy crap that was a lot of fire .
it was a huge cut of ahi .
the bison was very lean and tasted very clean .
it had no gamey taste at all .
the rest of the girls were not that attractive .
look at my review for that event coming soon .
no ghetto <UNK> here .
it ' s an average score according to yelp .
still a nice hotel though .
this place is more like a 0.0 star joint .
i simply had to have one .
my corned beef sandwich was awesome .
"poor service , bad menu , and worse food ."
"excellent food , professional service , expensive ."
the rib cap is the cut to try here .
"the meat offerings are simple , but masterfully diverse ."
i survived the meal .
0 challenges and have n't lost yet .
who does that anymore ?
"and , see you tomorrow !"
the 00 ounce pork porterhouse for only $ 00 .
they get a lot done real fast .
so i had to try their other items .
this is food porn at its best .
the food and service was beyond 0 stars .
they have a million people on staff .
this place truly deserves its michelin stars !
another waitress said they were extremely busy .
"he trains in a very fair , accountable way ."
this is some of the best sushi in phoenix .
this place is tight .
the technical skills of this team is unparalleled .
stopped by adobo dragon for lunch today .
the ribs were excellent and the service impeccable .
got to call around and haggle a little .
the greens were not that good at all .
there are harder holes on this course alone .
do you get my point on this stupid charge .
this time towards the rear .
lightly breaded with light colored flour and very tender .
great service terrific quality .
cheapest rates i found in town .
i would recommend cc <UNK> to anyone .
that is without a doubt .
overall it was a good experience .
the <UNK> appetizer was really good .
this place is awesome .
the food was nothing special .
went there for sunday lunch .
they also provided cornbread which was a little dry .
a hidden gem that you need to try .
it seems like they just do n't care .
street taco were excellent .
the shark tacos were also very good .
they also have a fantastic salsa bar .
i also ordered a medium soda and a biscuit .
sounds like incompetent management and poorly trained staff .
i have been to pho thanh on many occasions .
not like i have in the past .
just went for this saturdays last ufc fight !
this place has gone down hill ! ! .
i went here based on yelp <UNK> .
"now , we all like tuna , sushi style ."
they have a very good atmosphere .
the restaurant is in a converted auto service station .
the barbecue is good .
probably a little too heavy on the pepper .
i usually get ribs or brisket there .
opening a location again in pittsburgh made my day .
i have been going to ibiza for years now .
ibiza specializes in tapas dishes .
very large wine list .
make sure to get a voucher first before dining .

0 : classy ass poker room .
too bad it was too high-end for me .
belagio = best of the sin .
the <UNK> cafe is located in the excalibur casino .
the menu was extensive and the service decent .

great brunch in a great place .
bank with a credit union http://url
the customer service is non-existent .
the prices arent even great .
they are the worst company period .
no one could resolve my problem .
dont they give upgrades all the time ?
i once stayed at the mandalay bay delano .
carrie at the front desk should be checked .
"and for a lower , lower price ."
and to top it all off .

parking lot is easy with ample space .
"the <UNK> ' s were standard , just new ."
child care center as well .
ive had nothing but great service from this shop .
they also speak spanish .
very quick in this more hip chilled environment .
on the main floor are machines and free weights .
dumbbells are a full rack from 0-000 lbs .
park is great with there own lot .
i got here early and sat at the bar .
i would personally drive about 00 miles ea .
completely stuffed after this .
bathrooms are always clean and do not smell .
desert concluded with carrot cake and key lime pie .
i will be a steady customer now .

ahi tuna roll and black bean soup .
both were excellently done and well plated .
"shared the pork and shrimp fried dumplings , excellent ."
this is our must visit place when in town .
ca n't beat the lunch buffet .
great food & service .
guacamole as a starter .
great reminder of my home ny !
not very professional at all .
classic bait and switch .
reverse went out in my truck .
drove it from prescott az to phoenix az . .
- lrb - total bullshit - rrb - .
i knew where this was going .
so i authorized the work .
the people bring him over two checks .
family owned and operated .
i disputed it on my credit report .
how in the hell would i know that <UNK> ?
small place with a lot of hawaiian inspired dishes .
had the small portion of kalbi beef with rice .
nice place for a quick bite and friendly faces .
ordered the chicken and waffles and it was massive .
the place itself was pretty cool .
it has a unique interior .
they first gave me my buddy ' s crepe .
overall worst experience of my vegas trip .
there are no combos here .
nothing too interesting to describe .
patty was good but on the great side .
these <UNK> can take a beating hence the price .
not worth the money .
the duck was ok .
took a while to get a waiter .
the tartar sauce was really good .
at ramsay ' s this was not the case .
"nice hotel , very <UNK> ."
the rooms itself are plain .
"small bathtub , separate shower , which i like ."
drinks are expensive poolside which is expected .
not really a pool party type of pool .
overall it was a nice stay .
excellent selection of draft beer and single malt scotch .
i probably stop in there about twice a month .
the restrooms are small .
an interesting taste sensation .
the following week i came back on thursday evening .
i eat lunch here about once a month .
chinese buffets can be an adventure .
this is a great little bar .
emphasis on ` ` little ' ' .
the chicken alfredo pizza is pretty good too .
that is quite tasty .
they have a patio outside and a gas fireplace .
and dinner was solidly good but not great .
i quite enjoyed my meal .
i will definately be going back .
the friday fish fry is good .
i ' ve never had a bad meal .
martini bob and reno are masters of the <UNK> .
perfect fare for a cold <UNK> evening .
for desert i had the cheesecake and coffee .
great place for a quiet drink .
perhaps a little overpowering in some ways .
it was very good .
call ahead and get outside seating .
top 0 pizza joints .
these guys are never really happy to see you .
they do have some of the best pizza around .
the others try but come up short .
the food will make you sick .
i usually tip larger there than any other place .
while wandering before the movies .
this was extra ordinary .
what a change from most places .
well worth the 00 mile trip !
the gravy was spicy but i liked it .
barbecue sauces were tasty .
very nice place and people .
the cost is very reasonable .
i will certainly be back .
hopefully they will have delivery in the near future .
"thanks hangover heaven , your a lifesaver ."
are the rooms awesome ?
do they have good places to eat ?
well that was a mistake .
the place seemed to have a nice setting .
this place does not have any sitting area .
the beans and rice were old and reheated .
my fajitas were cheap poorly cooked sliced chuck steak .
this place should close .
the portions were tiny .
the service was snarky and slow .
called precision when one of my units stopped operating .
my ac units are 0 years old .
technician wanted to replace compressor .
i showed him the warranty for parts .
the tech was fine .
all of the food and drinks were very good .
the staff was top notch .
these guys do not disappoint .
this is our new place .
the menu is epic .
dutch crunch bread to die for .
not what i imagined a marijuana <UNK> to be .
this place managed to fuck up bacon .
the fries were freaking epic .
i got something described as sliced meat over potatoes .
"keep <UNK> , you will not find the flavor ."
you wan na eat what i ate ?
you can literally taste the indifference .
the video games were the real let down .
$ 0 a game ?
they ' re good kids .
your personal intensity is freaking me out .
the food is stupid disorganized .
and forks are a real commodity around here .
nobody said a word !
"no wonder , with these prices ."
"full cart , $ 00 ."
another is $ 0.00 .
why not make them one price ?
could n't get out of there fast enough .
those are your options .
"great pizza joint , but that is an understatement ."
new location for my favourite ayce sushi in montreal .
a few more options than the one in <UNK> .
"overpriced , gimmicky burger joint ."
worst mac and cheese i had in a while .
nothing was on point .
i do n't get the hype over this place .
service was excellent as well .
"nice portions , good variety ."
fish & chips as it should be done .
well worth the money .
i guess that makes me retro .
staff was excellent and very engaging .
atmosphere was like a casino cafe .
but all and all the staff was excellent !
but the presentation was still spot on .
last bit of class in downtown .
this place is definitely a classic .
but the rooms definitely need an update .
great bar kinda close to downtown las vegas .
a hangout for local downtown people .
<UNK> will bee located on your left hand side .
the prices for everything is pretty decent .
"when in doubt , jollibee ."
they remembered me by name on my second visit .
i went home and had a rotisserie chicken .
roast pork and roast duck are must .
service is good and proficient .
i suspect illegal dumping .
then the dump truck comes around <UNK> am .
kitchen facilities were excellent .
wow ... this is a <UNK> of a show .
` ` whats your favourite number ?
also the best part about ichiza is the price .
who spends any time in their rooms anyways ?
the sweet n sour sauce is off the hook .
a perfect way to relax and eat .
"oh yeah , and the spring rolls are killer ."
the pizza itself is pretty damn good .
the side are pretty good as well .
drinks are what really killed me here .
my go to watering hole .
the service : <UNK> was the man .

"also , where is the insect collections ?"
reasonably priced rare vinyl on the wall .
the staff was friendly and the food was adequate .
the fish tacos are good .
this place is great .
good hot sauce gets 0 start f from me .
buy a fucking camera system .

price is what you ' d expect .
"great selection , friendly staff , good prices ."
the service was excellent .
i would recommend this place .

they ' ll probably be going out of business .
food here is great .
"great food , great service , great atmosphere ."
"gf got the chicken marsala , which was good ."
"food , service , and atmosphere are all good ."
you do not receive what you ask for .
it is great in it ' s cooling capabilities .
the lighting is horrible .
the salsa bar was a lot of fun .
the waitress apologized and did comp our beverages .
the food arrived with no napkins or silverware .
the beer never arrived .
either way i will not go back .
this place is fine .
it ' s good but not <UNK> good .
service is excellent overall .
this joint can run up your bill pretty quickly .
"overall , i came away satisfied with the value ."
the quality and taste are exceptional .
service was excellent as well .
this place is pretty terrible .
they can not cook a steak .
the servers seem to be absolutely clueless as well .
very professional young man .
"thus , 0 stars ."
delivery has always been prompt and courteous .
the egg was a nice addition .
nothing totally amazing but they taste very high quality .
and the food does come out fast .
this place really hits the spot for me .
all the basics that i need are here .
also make sure you get their frequent buyer card .
or be prepared to wait for a while .
this is a great place to learn !
"flavors are good , and the food is excellent ."
"little asian bridges , and everything ."
these guys were on their game .
and of course the food was excellent .
lots of good drinks .
so you ' re not really saving any money .
plus the equipment is extremely old and clearly refurbished .
no one at cox could explain why .
but they just can not support an inferior product .
they make excellent gifts .
at least it was hot .
i ' m gon na go with 0.0 stars .
they also have a few hot food items available .
very popular breakfast place in las vegas !
that ' s it for the negatives .
the food was very tasty .
i do like pizza joints like this .
nothing memorable or very unique .
make sure you make reservations well in advance .
nice modern place that serves healthy food .
try something that seems different than your ordinary tastes .
how can you beat the value of this place ?
food was good but nothing really special .
"but long story short , this place is outstanding ."

staff were completely uninterested .
i had the surf and turf burrito .
great lunch spot if youre in this area .
staff was friendly but a little obnoxious .
"honestly , it ' s good but not great ."
not worth half what i paid .
been here a few times now .
the best part is portion size .
always good pizza for the price .
"been here lots of times , never been dissatisfied ."
the sweet chili ones are the best .
plenty of other options around .
been here about 0 or 0 times .
been a customer of paradise for years .
wo n't be back until they figure it out .
service also good but not great .
"which in phoenix , is awful ."
food came out fast as well .
biggest problem is to avoid it during the rush .
still not very good though .
let ' s start with the environment .
would recommend to any sushi lover .
a little above average .
"again , no wow factor , average ."
outdoor patio was perfect for a late afternoon lunch .
will definitely make chelsea ' s a regular stop .
"amazing food , great service and wine list ."
is honest about when he ca n't .
` ` yellow ' ' is obviously pointless .
food comes in nondescript white and brown paper bags .
had lousy service to follow .
"dirty , local drunks and heavy smoking ."
not a place that tourists would like .
this is a solid burger place on the strip .
i had the ` ` hells kitchen burger .
but it was well worth the try .
however it fell short of my expectations .
"dinner was enjoyable , the service was outstanding ."
plus i ca n't believe the low prices .
stop counting calories for an evening .
the vegetables and sides are outstanding .
some things were great others were subpar .
"not bad , but nothing special ."
what more could you ask for ?
zero stars this guy sucks ... .
"we came for tapas , and ordered four plates ."
do not order from gus ' s .
"overhyped , snobbish , over-priced ."
results : sheer disappointment .
everything was downhill from there .
my waiter service was virtually non-existent .
the food taste and quality were mediocre at best .
a premium smoked salmon from costco would taste better .
the chocolate <UNK> are made differently here .
come in early by 0:00 to beat the crowd .
the <UNK> restaurant is right on the second floor .
the cable tv channels are medieval .
no hbo or good movie station .

efficient and quick service from airport to city centre .
all for # 0 each way .
this place just opened ... give them time .
"the pate is delicious , simply put ."
again ... this place just opened .
it was great checking out all of the games .
it ' s reminiscent of van <UNK> .
"the almond croissant was better , in comparison ."
no complaint on the poutine .
some claim costco fries are the best .
the dumplings were adequate .
"service was good , the food arrived very fast ."
they take debit and issue legitimate receipts .
sorry for ruining the hype .
"however , it lacked seasoning and smokiness ."
it tasted a bit bland overall .
i ' ve had better steaks .
only commercial beers available .
there was something wrong with my lattã © .
overall i was n't left with a great impression .
the attention here is wrong .
tony <UNK> improved what is already great .
giving it 0 stars for the setting only .
i ' m looking forward for a repeat .
there is <UNK> in the coffee preparation .
it ' s authentic on every level .
"<UNK> , the house beer , is a-ok ."
it goes well with fried plantain .
a baker ' s dozen is currently $ 0 .
not to be <UNK> with actual chinese cuisine .
"go simple , get the traditional <UNK> <UNK> ."
real food at this price ?
service was quick on an early saturday evening .
the goat curry had fall-off-the-bone meat .
the sides were adequate .
it ' s also right next to <UNK> .
"the price is right , and they take credit ."
it ' s not a typo .
"as well , the cooking appears to be consistent ."
no hesitation in recommending this place to friends .
really cool and enthusiastic staff .
the place is kind of very cool though .
without a doubt in my opinion .
the ribs are decent .
the brisket was dry and <UNK> tender .
refined <UNK> » te in an unpretentious setting .
great mix of spices in the fries .
<UNK> : rating based on my poutine only .
in fact it was creamy and quite tasty .
poutine is decent and adequate enough for the price .
enjoy a good slice of cheesecake and get out .
one of the newer mcdonald ' s in montreal .
"the meat was quite tough , almost rubbery ."
"total paid after tax and tip , $ 00 ."
"low carbonation , and comfortable to swallow ."
"yes , incredible taro bubble tea as jane mentioned ."
but the clock is ticking .
also free drink with bean purchase .
"you will be missed , <UNK> ."
this place deserve 0 star overall everything is great .
hands down best pizza in town .
below average lobster roll .
- rrb - and expected to decide from there ?
an incredible end to a wonderful meal .
00:00 was my scheduled pick up time .
most mechanics try to charge a ton .
"not this place , kevin helped me out ."
these guys are awesome .
i ' ve eaten here numerous times .
used to go to this place in texas .
all sandwiches are good and the place is immaculate .
there was a 00 minute wait .
the horseradish sause was excellent though .
the service this night was not very good .
my wife ' s po-boy and gumbo were cold .
he is also a retired army <UNK> .
here is part of his <UNK> from his site .
so the drive though is worthless .
also inside is very stuffy and hot .
i must say it was worth it .
it would blow warm air for a few min .
or whatever and refilled it with freon .
another dissatisfied customer here .
"payless car rental , you can suck it ."
unfortunately those were the biggest pros .
the dinning room was also not up to par .
they currently offer delivery in a 0.0 mile radius .
cooked and seasoned to a perfect med-rare .
i ' m looking forward to my next visit .
give this place a try .
and did i mention that the food is great ?
the staff is friendly and the place is clean .
i ordered the brisket beef tips with spicy sauce .
more than half the meat served was fat .
the mac and cheese was hot and tasted great .
the salsa verde is excellent .
not a rip off either .
the food did not even taste that good .
floor was sticky and food was standard .
best pizza in henderson .
but it ' s damn good either way .
best $ 0 burger around .
smash fries and fried pickles are excellent .
always friendly and fast service .
that was not the worse part .
i have yet to find that <UNK> dive bar .
there is no food here that i know of .
strange little place indeed .
good place for breakfast .
i ' ve never had a bad meal here .
they have good food .
they recently started doing alcohol .
can you say expensive ?
the far east valley needs something .
the lines get long at about 00am .
this is a great little bar .
i will next time as for cheese instead .
it was very big and filling as well .
but this is one of them .
it ' s nothing more than typical bar food .
but what is good here is the chicken sandwich .
they have many hot flavors .
i prefer the hottest one which is nuclear .
even this is n't that hot .
he is a great sushi chef .
"anyway , the wings are the best ."
i get the killer wings and request them grilled .
all i needed was a fork .
i paid for my meal and left .
they have good produce and excellent meats .
the cheese steaks are poor and the burgers bland .
perhaps they tried just a bit too hard .
the highlight of the menu is the <UNK> burger .
topping this burger is the magic .
grilled onions peppers and shrooms dripping with cheese .
"oh , and the ribs ?"
there are usually only two folks there .
a japanese person would be very insulted by this .
this place has always remained faithful .
the best sandwich is the salmon blt .
the best beer is the ipa or the <UNK> .
the specials here are always good .
"also , the seating is nice here ."
had a steak sandwich and it was great .

too many other better options in vegas .
i expected better from this establishment .
most of my party expressed disappointment with their meals .
"not horrible , but not exactly good ."
las vegas has many other great options .
the quality compared the price .
i ordered the wagyu ribeye .
. probably <UNK> gone to charlie palmer .
. ill update after eating it .
regular people like yourselves can probably share .
. food coma at noon .
the service from the waitstaff is nonexistent .
. i doubt it .
place a bet in the sportsbook .
i did n't make that mistake this time .
i had a bellagio suite in the spa tower .
. amazing views of the fountains and the strip !
better than bakery nouveau in west seattle .
the steaks were cooked to near perfection .
the only downer was dessert .
"good service , good food ."
you do n't need any syrup .
bc grand luxe has lost its edge .
the waffles werent as good as i remember .
probably the best thing i ate in vegas .
creamed corn is a must .
"the bread pudding is overrated imo , but good ."
everyone seems to rave about the chicken and waffles .
not that the cashier was too bright .
lip service is all you really get .
long wait the first night we ate there .
definitely better than most korean places .
as previous reviews state .
. def a once in a lifetime experience .
the service and attention to detail is on point .
i went with the veal .
was better with the caviar .
see what real food is .
we came here for my sons 00st birthday .

perfect tonkotsu broth with braised pork and toppings .
the staff is amazing and the atmosphere is enjoyable .
classic buffet style set up with everyday filipino staples .
a spacious and relaxing atmosphere to smoke hookah at .

my initial impression of the place was pretty good .
but i compensated by returning the next day .
you got ta try that combo .
this place is kinda badass .
consistently great dishes and a fair price .
very friendly staff and clientele .
this is where the charismatic come for breakfast .
the cowboy scramble is filling and tasty .
a cool atmosphere and friendly staff .

000 bistro is closed .
"imho , they were understaffed ."
the pork belly was charred .
"the fish , mush ."
and nobody went long without a drink in hand .
the bartender was just finished pouring the shots .

caesar salad should not be too spicy to eat .
called today when front door bolt froze ... saturday .
"first , the buffalo shrimp are pretty amazing ."
the food was excellent as was the presentation .
where to start with this place ?

"prices were mid range , not bad at all ."
would recommend the empanadas !
this place was unbelievable !
these guy provide an excellent customer service experience !
came to vegas for a conference .
management said complaints are common .
worst hotel experience of my life .
only thing that could improve is the setting .
it <UNK> nicely with the cold lobster meat .
the service was great for a pizza joint .
we made due with the limited counter space .
the work was done within a few hrs .
i ' ll be back .
"they consistently demonstrate honesty , integrity and value ."

quick summary : just go .
enough reading and start walking to this place .
only downside is walls are thin .
the desserts are very good .
the lamb shoulder cooked to perfection .
without a players club .
the place is very clean .
price is very worth it .

"great music , the staff was happy and energetic ."
the room big enough for four adults .
if you have n't seen it .
its worth check out .

this place is a hotel first and casino second .
wi-fi is free in the lobby and pool side .
it ' s ok if it fits your budget .

and for the price you really cant beat it .
this is for the fireside lounge .

* the rates are reasonable for the location .
* the parking situation here is terrible .

the drinks were absolutely outstanding .
the chicken parm is fantastic as well !

all the sauces are made from scratch .
amazing service rich soup amazing side dishes .
0 stars hands down .

you just ca n't beat ' em .
"f you guys , you just lost a customer ."
"it was overpriced , and old ."
excellent fresh made smoothies .
overall it is probably not that exceptional .
the elevators shake and the room was dirty .
and the food is good here too .
could n't get a refill in under 00 minutes .
food was great but even better was the staff .
well worth the money .
excellent food and spirits .
worst repairs iv ever experienced .

edgy but really comfortable .

this place takes way to long .

go there you will make it a regular stop .
never had these two dishes anywhere else .
"first off , mashed potato in a burger ?"
my first impression of the store was the couches .
the one picture of their food does look good .
i visit out of personal preference and necessity .
a plan will help you out .
"i visited the american , asian and italian sections ."
happy to have found one in las vegas .
how you may ask .
they have a separate concession stand setup and entrance .
i have a thing for value and food .
bring your players card for a small discount .
giant desserts and sandwiches are excellent .
she asked a few key food questions .
two floors including a spacious vip area is excellent .
the drink refill stations are easily accessible .

think of a <UNK> .
grab a coffee and enjoy some good people watching .
it certainly does take a village .
now a much faster show than before .
each number now flows into the next quite well .
no wifi offered from this location .
last year i saw a <UNK> bomber up close .
the burger was seemingly flavorless .
the spices are also tasty on the fries .
from landing to limo in less than 00 minutes .
i should have asked my waiter .
the crust did taste good until the last piece .
they are <UNK> lit and have bright colors .
they usually will try to help you out .
the sampler items are pretty good to nibble on .
fast service & food .
opening day was an excellent time .
go here when you want the premium feast buffet .
enjoy the excellent meat and asian food sections .
then the pork buns and finally the sandwich .
"charging for refills is kinda baffling , like really ?"
drinks were a certain addition more .
the wait staff is always there to refill drinks .
"wow , what a sight to see ."
they have always arrived before the time estimated .
the taste of the sandwich was good initially .
then came a drink refill request .
"as i found out , they are not ."
they should make sandwiches to order and allow refills .
that was not a good sign .
both places serve large meals for good prices .
the temperature of sides were adequate .
the mac & cheese was tasty .
"it too was slightly warm , but not hot ."
"after six years , i was done ."

i really liked everything i saw .

"great food , friendly staff and great price ."
service and food is great ... manager is poor
dr . <UNK> is fantastic .
recently it seems to be getting worse .
we never feel like anyone really understands customer service .
surprisingly high quality food at a small corner pub .
you wo n't regret it .
pasta dish first was pretty good .
pasta dish first was pretty good .
the constant <UNK> of dishes did not help either .
a veggie burrito for example is 000 calories .
' ' this is after waiting a few minutes .
i would rate the food a solid 0 stars .
the waitress was initially prompt and took our order .
the service however was mediocre to poor .
he served my wife last in all instances .
the service is excellent and always delivered pleasantly .
the sky was clear and the weather was perfect .
the sweet potato au <UNK> were a masterpiece .
awesome burgers and fries .
did i mention the burger ' s are awesome ?
i purchased a soda - tipped the waitress .
i ' ll list some of my random observations .
the real winner was the prawn spring rolls .
the only part worse than this is the service .
the wait staff and managers obviously do n't care .
mostly the food but the service was barely acceptable .
do n't try the buffet lunch .
"again , do n't get the buffet lunch ."
it is a highly <UNK> joint in monona .
"good food , good drinks ."
"free bacon , <UNK> ."
its at least worth a stop .
and the cheesesteak eggrolls are great too .
checked this place out over the weekend .
. or lee ' s liquor lounge in downtown .
right down to the bartender steve .
but what can i expect here in the desert ?
grain belt or no grain belt .
in about a month .
thank you again blue ox !
complimentary starbucks in the room is a nice touch .
saves a few $ $ .
only negatives are the casino was small .
apart from that i would recommend this hotel !
a great temple built along traditional lines .
masala <UNK> was excellent .
great authentic south indian food .
has a wide variety of food choices .
tow weeks ago traveled to vegas for short vacation .
then drove to henderson .
luckily found firefly by accident .
overall had a <UNK> time .
will come back for sure on next visit .
worst dinning experience ever .
managers did a terrible job .
have eaten here several times for lunch .
several unusual combinations are available .
it was a pleasure to dine here .
the food was well prepared and nicely presented .
"excellent wild boar carnitas , highly recommend ."
perfect custom fit and easy to install and remove .
they have it down to a <UNK> .
i highly recommend desert pool safety .
very reasonably priced too .
it was all great tasting .
burrito is excellent and is filled to the max .
good place for lobster lovers .
the <UNK> ' s batter coulda used more flavor .
all in all not too bad really great buffet .
"the food itself is decent , but nothing special ."
it ' s a burger king .
maybe some tartar sauce would go well with them .
under 00 minutes in my case .
"their pizza is decent , nothing special ."
the prices are quite high .
much better than you ' d get on campus .
me and my wife had a very nice dinner .
' ' i highly recommend .
the <UNK> masala and vindaloo were tasty .
we had the mixed shawarma dish for two .
i went there for an oil change .
i found the staff to be friendly and courteous .
i will return for other maintenance check ups .
good pizza and wings and very nice people .
"they were very friendly , courteous and fast ."
been coming here since they opened 0 years ago .
the food is consistently good .
the food is really good at a fair price .
a must visit in vegas .
i highly recommend this bank of america location !
i do n't know where to start .
nothing anyone can do .
this is not only fraud but theft .
"yes , many trips were made ."
i ca n't recommend the wynn buffet enough .
they were expertly seasoned spears fried to perfection .
next we had blueberry and caramel corn shakes .
this box is awesome .
i dropped in and was immediately welcomed by jake .
often i go to crossfit boxes and rate them .
many are good boxes and some are very good .
coffee is very good too .
nelson <UNK> owner of magic pest control
more than its fair share of shady characters .
not a great feeling .
yet small enough to not be ginormous as costco .
i still give this place a 0 star rating .
bring you doggie here .
the best drink menu i experienced in vegas .
tasteful decor for a romantic evening .
the meal was impressive .
0 course wagyu grade 0 is a must .
appetizers were good but not great .
the kobe tartar stood out from the others .
the steaks were outstanding .
they waiters treat you like royalty .
one of the best meals ive had .
got there at 00 and was seated promptly .
it was all getting comped by aria anyways .
all the sides were good though .
we even made it rain .
come here if you cant get in anywhere else .
marquee is the place to be .
"honestly , it ' s all hype ."
generally noticed they do n't handle rushes well .
"love this place , usually hit it at lunch ."
will defiantly go back and would highly recommend .
heavy food but well made .
the tater tits are awesome .
it was 00 dollars plus .
a true tourist trap .
how do you park .
and the food is great along with the service .
foods not bad and price is reasonable .
feels like a serious tourist trap .
only thing good was the waiter .
food and atmosphere are a 0 star .
alas the service is 0 star .
waited 00 minutes to be acknowledged at our table .
food looked and smelled awesome .
this place was unique .
lots of tv ' s everywhere .
but i had bacon wrapped chicken fried steak .
my wife had fish & chips .
worst hotel in vegas .
everything was broken and needed updating .
"ultimately , this hotel is going down hill ."
there is no pride in ownership of this place .
i would recommend any other hotel in vegas .
the espresso was very good as well .
nice feel to this place .
the service was excellent .
disappointing compared to the downtown chicago smith and wollensky .
check in and check out were slow and inefficient .
"the room lights were really confusing , irritating ."
illy espresso made by <UNK> servers .
this place really turned the party into a blast .
best ravioli on the planet .
great fresh fish as well
overall was pleased with the place and service .
will probably go back there sometime .
it also included post game pictures on the court .
would i go to another game ?
the over all atmosphere in the arena was great .
not overcooked not runny .
will probably be back again .
"guiness on draft , good food , good service ."
the rooms were clean and updated .
and for a reasonable price .
taking a cab to mandalay bay was $ 00 .
at least they repainted the drywall .
it had such a humming noise it was unusable .
bottom line : do n't stay here .
the food is always good .
they were both 0 out of 0 .
"we were immediately seated , no waiting ."
the place ran very efficiently while we were there .
flat screen tv with a decent selection of channels .
be mindful of what you order here .
the service was extremely slow .
do n't come here if you want good food .
this place was a great find thanks to yelp !
the food is what really stands out here .
as this place is pretty pricey .
staff at the front desk were professional and polite .
but that is about were the positive experience ends .
"great , fresh burgers ."
had decent sides and good atmosphere .
seems like they are short staffed .
also the waitress is inattentive with an <UNK> .
there are only 0 or 0 .
good tuna <UNK> and tostada .
food and sides were great .
the portions are large as well .
hope to try several more dishes in the future .
good for a date .
has good shaved ice for the southwest .
not near the best i ' ve had though .
not everyone wants a giant ball of ice .
good for its atmosphere .
great place for a date .
the customer service alone is worth the five stars .
the selection is fantastic .
they have hundreds of comics and dozens of toys .
ken knows more about comics then any human should .
i had the habanero burger with sweet potato fries .
well ... these guys use locally roasted espresso beans .
"outlets galore ! ! well done , guys ."
this place truly ` ` get ' s it .
0 bucks to cash my check .
it ' s across from heart attack grill .
"the staff though , are the best part ."
took two stars off for the cost alone .
loosen your belt and shove in everything you can .
tasted great with the curry .
this place is not that expensive anyway .
these people actually charge for wifi .
the upload speed is 0 mb .
<UNK> and above is now considered high speed .
the place is great .
seemed long but acceptable .
the highlight for me was the barry white .
there bar was a complete disaster .
pretty expensive and not terribly original .
as usual talented performers .
poorly trained servers and cooks .
and guess what it was partially completely uncooked .
plenty of better places to spend $ 000 .
i am torn between a three and a four .
best <UNK> sauce around !
i am referring these guys to everyone i know !
"wood fired , crust edges are nicely <UNK> ."
$ 00 for an over-cooked and virtually tasteless burger .
poor food is not the fault of the server .
order the <UNK> burger .
you can thank me later .
this place is off the charts awesome .
what ' s with all the 0 stars ?
"jamaican me crazy , mon !"
the jerk chicken is perfect .
just enough spice to keep things interesting .
ya found it here .
these guys really are as good as it gets .
time to call precision plumbing .
these guys are top notch .
* i ' ve since updated this review .

service was marginal at best
remember the fourth <UNK> .

the service was friendly and the beer is cold .
the chicken & rice soup was pretty bland .
"five star food , good wait service ."
the sushi was excellent .
thanks to yelp we found out about this place .
i started things off with the <UNK> road trip .
i finished things off with the mad city flight .
parking was in an underground garage .
the room was very clean .
i had their ipa and classic irish dry stout .
this bowl fits the bill .
one of the best i ' ve had .
it was just your typical expensive airport food .
terminal 0 is by far the better terminal .
i was expecting my mind to be blown !
i thought the ones at pho bosa were better .
so i went with the shaking beef instead .
the carving station is still pretty decent .
"they have sausages , turkey , and prime rib ."
location : nice location inside the m resort .
parking is much easier here .
"0st pump , the credit card reader was broken ."
"0rd pump , finally good to go ."
"now , if they would only fix their pumps ."
very affordable place to stay .

cheap rates brings in some of the riff <UNK> .
they use pretty big bowls here .
food : a bit overpriced even for gourmet burgers .
the burger came with a small bucket of fries .
i ' ve only eaten here for dinner .
expect to wait about 0 to 0 hours .
the current price for the buffet is $ 00.00 .
parking is plentiful at this location .
the seating here is picnic style .
they are able to speak english .
however they brought out the steak with brie instead .
the steak was delicious .
service : the service was excellent .
that can get a little unsanitary in a hurry .
they take pride in being the best in vegas .
service : service was pretty good .
there ' s nothing aesthetically pleasing about the place .
inside the restaurant can get pretty warm .
regular or half order .
i think my friend counted only 00 seats total .
now for the important part ... the food .
now for the ramen .
the flavor was good .
service : the service was friendly and great .
just follow the signs for your rental car company .
overall this was not a pleasant experience .
she did n't try to sell me an upgrade .
is the computer slow ?
what ' s taking so long ?
nobody tells you anything .
it ' s cheap for a reason .
unfortunately i ' ve had better pastrami elsewhere .
it looked like a two man operation .
you should be able to see it from decatur .
very affordable rates 0 .

the marathon has a pretty strict <UNK> time limit .
you ' ll be glad you did !

"interesting building , cool location ."
"anyway , on to the experience itself ."
"good food , good service ."
- <UNK> burger : do you get it ?
- fries : you get a lot of fries .
is that my fault ?
should i have even mentioned all this ?
the problem was the service ... or lack thereof .
it ' s a pun .
$ 00 for that ?
but there is really where my criticism must end .
"it ' s the famous dish , right ?"
but there would be that brief moment .
- sticky toffee pudding : i am dead again .
the food secured the 0 stars firmly in place .
other than that its a great spot .

i went with my two kids for lunch .
"had chicken tenders , bread sticks & mozzarella sticks ."
staff is very friendly and knowledgeable .
"so , my closest alternative is sport chalet ."
"so , i asked if they carried chalk ."
i just knew everything was incredible .
we also were handed spinach and pumpkin bread too .
i recommend this place .
<UNK> were going off and not answered .
easy 0 star experience all around .
eric is a great server .
"and , a good burger is what we had ."
"and , unfortunately , it showed ."
it was an interesting night to say the least .
it became <UNK> - 00 pm to 0 am .
"i know , late night starch and carbs ."
they had a great late night special .
"so , the wait was about 0/0 hour ."
the food eventually came out and it was good .
plus the little jelly jars were awesome .
then we made the trek around the buffet offerings .
"they had everything from , chinese to mexican food ."
my buddy took full advantage of the buffet .
the cakes were all very moist and fluffy .
"so , i say this with no hesitation ."
mccarran is an easy airport to navigate .
we valet parked once and found parking another time .
valets were friendly and quick .
there is a lot to see and do .
yelling for sake bombs .
i wish <UNK> luck in the future .
which makes for a great night out .
"so , i went to wash up ."
"so , someone must have dropped the ball here ."
every once in a while .
"but , i ' ll deal with it ."
it has always been plentiful and comes out hot .
i had the ribs and wing platter .
"anyhow , back to my review ."
after eating a couple of chips i was done .
i gave up and just accepted it .
"- rrb - , was great ."
"the burrito i had was so-so , but edible ."
they look so good on the commercials .
that is a nice touch .
the service was awesome as well .
the food was delivered with that same smile .
"and , to be open late , to boot ?"
i ended up with a skillet filled with pork .
ca n't go wrong .
can get coffee cake with meal .
it may become a yearly tradition .
the lights were done right .
i expected gaudy but was happily surprised .
this outdoor marked is deceiving .
it seems much bigger when driving by .
he has to get a burger and fries .
this place is a yelp hangout .
"and , i can see why ."
it was a mistake for sure .
some hits and some misses .
"but , the quality of sourdough remains the same ."
the food is pretty good .
everything from the players card specials to the desserts .
nothing mind blowing but you leave satisfied .
"again , no big deal ."
what a great deal .
usually on my night of <UNK> .
that was a bonus .
the sausage was the star on the plate .
i also like the toasted bun .
"so , no real complaints ."
employees - this can be tricky to review .
this is where i would take away my stars .
the showers had individual stalls .
not really a problem .
a good selection of db ' s and benches .
caffeine was absolutely necessary .
let me emphasize the word starting .
everything was set up great and easy to follow .
"and , of course , everything was expensive ."
best pizza in this part of town .
the pizza here is still my favorite though .
"so , that is a bonus ."
i had the low carb chicken bowl .
everything was well cooked .
the place was no frills and comfortable .
not this location as it is a long drive .
but if i was in the area ?
check out was easy and off i went .
comedy for the laughs ?
action with <UNK> violence ?
my first movie back was turbo !
the movie is what it is .
the theater was clean and well kept .
i can be a bit of a <UNK> .
steaks with some kind of potato .
overall it was a good night .

not on <UNK> & <UNK> .
i just wanted to sweat things out tonight .
so where to start ?
parking is always easy on the weekdays .
"but , you can still find a spot somewhere ."
check in is great and easy .
the locker room is always in pretty decent shape .
now off to the workout area ' s .
"but , it ' s not the case ."
it would help save my upper shoulders and neck .
the wet area has been clean and well kept .
that goes a long way with me .
so far a 0 star experience .
the parking is always easy and plentiful .
"but , that is for a different review ."
viva salsa is in the heart of boulder station .
. it was n't a problem here though .
i ended up having a <UNK> carne asada burrito .

no problems but no expectations either .
they are n't flashy nor run down .
i can work a <UNK> .
sorry ... i digress .
this place is great for the <UNK> ' s .
i hate calling places with automated <UNK> .
i like their music and video selections .
that is nice as well .
"anyhow , the place was clean and well stocked ."
i had a lamb chop .
dessert : cake pops and jelly belly ' s .
nothing else mattered to me .
00 donuts for less than $ 00 .
not a bad way to walk into a store .
i even wore a tie .
our first encounter was the <UNK> as you enter .
"brad pitt , <UNK> , angelina <UNK> etc . ."
that was probably the highlight of the evening .
nothing special but not bad either .
i made the order for 0 large pizzas .
that makes a difference to me .
so here were my observations .
maybe it ' s better if you are <UNK> .
the parking structure was easy and plentiful .
what a great deal for just signing up .
' ' will usually do the trick .
$ 0.00 a gallon .
the crust was soggy and floppy .
"wow , just wow !"
"great service , great assortment and great prices ."
i try and stay away from chinese fast food .
it was about a foot off of the ground .
bottom floor is where all of the action is .
i took advantage of that aspect of the buffet .
that would be a great touch .
but more of that later .
the ribs were stellar and the fries seemed endless .
"so , that speaks volumes ."
you know some of the basic stuff .
this is more of a 0.0 star experience .
"but , the price was right ."
it was the nfl combine class with jason <UNK> .
we were thinking of a new place to dine .
then comes back and takes our meal order .
"so , this review will probably be pretty quick ."
it seemed that everyone else was doing the same .
"anyhow , the sale was easy ."

i ' ll be back on my next visit .
it ' s a business choice .
even your kids can take part in the adventure .
"great food , and good prices ."
this particular location for avis is a disappointment .
no decent place to eat in the hotel .
it might as well be in omaha .
"tough decision , but probably necessary ."
that ' s a really classy move .
mine involved blueberry and <UNK> as major components .
and the little ciabatta crackers ?

looking at $ 00 for a bowl .
thanks bob and <UNK> .
place is well maintained .
"nothing spectacular , but nothing negative ."
everything about this place is big portioned .
service has always been excellent .
stayed here 0 weekends for a business trip .
the area adjacent is called ` ` westgate .
i ' ve only been here for lunch .
when i went the place was a ghost town .
"i would n't refuse a return visit , however ."
<UNK> brown is a performing machine .
i laughed nearly non-stop .
service was fantastic and prompt food was just ok .
enchiladas and burritos seemed to be runny .
food came out very fast .
"it tasted ok , but the consistency was off ."
first it ' s the staff .
the menu has all the typical coffee shop <UNK> .
this place is huge in the vegas tech scene .
the one highlight for me was the <UNK> sportsbook .
huge screens and nice seating .
what makes holsteins stand out are the milkshakes .
what makes a mint chocolate chip milkshake stand out ?
drinks were moderately priced for an <UNK> casino resort .
had comfortable seating and a good sound system .
had a real nice time .
it ' s a subway .
they are usually very understaffed and are clueless .
it really went well with the honey mustard dressing .
it was very tasty .
ordered some business cards in a pinch .
a real popular place among the unlv students .
the nigiri was enjoyable but that was all .
"ate everywhere , drank at many different places ."
visited this place twice .
. a sort of fish .
the best smoked meat sandwich .
apex is a scam .
update : it seems this establishment has changed ownership .
"coffee was terrible , again stale ."
my wife and i really enjoyed this place .
service was spot on .
food is top notch too .
place is small so get a reservation .
super good and healthy great thai food .
"service was ok , food was borderline terrible ."
the tacos were embarrassingly bad .
this place is an absolute joke .
food is almost as bad as the service .
this place will be out of biz very soon .
"they do have good food , though ."
"comfy seats , good service , below average food ."
the wait staff and bouncers are all pretty cool .
not a bad stop on a saturday night .
will not waste time here again .
best i have had in phoenix at a restaurant .
they work with you on price and everything .
i started with o premium years ago .
they were locally owned and had great service .
"nice person , but completely useless ."
danny was the service tech .
the 00/00 classes are a great all around workout .
this settled my <UNK> .
it was a fantastic end to a great meal .
the bbq was above average .
"good burgers , not great ."
friendly place with decent beer selection .
"usually great coffee , alway great bacon and pancakes !"
overall really good quality food and service .
taste is unremarkable but the ingredients seem quite fresh .
the go-to place for very good steaks .
what more could you ask for ?
the layout and vibe of the place is great .
service is # 0 on my priority list .
service was great all-around and fast .
"the place looks , feels and smells great ."
liquid pool is worth the go .
the cabanas are set back away from the action .
the standard rooms are great too .
they are average at best .
not worth the money .
great course to play .
cheers awesome staff and great atmosphere .
the staff is awesome and the cars are fast .
up to 00 mph .
helpful staff and the course is in great condition .
"great restaurants , gaming and entertainment ."
great food and even better people .
overall it was very good .
"meaty , moist and delicious ."
this is a must for your vegas trip .
"the fries were pretty good , above average ."
the specialty drinks are overpriced .
i will resist returning for a third time .
some people here say it is too expensive .
i get my money ' s worth .
"shame on me , i guess ."
our steaks were done pretty well .
the <UNK> clams appetizer was awesome .
"now , on to the food ."
i ' m mad now .
the prices are reasonable .
or maybe just one trend .
"if i ordered medium , i got well done ."
"well , those times are over ."
the cheese plate at $ 00 is ridiculously small .
where ' d the steak go ?
"yeah , they can cook beef to temp now ."
especially if someone else is picking up the check .
that is no longer true .
the pizzas taste great .
the prices are a little high .
never ever microwave unless you enjoy eating soggy garbage .
for less money than the other shop .
here ' s an example of what i mean .
<UNK> hit it out of the park yet again .
"solid food , good wine selection ."
the poached salmon platter is a nice lighter selection .
these range from . 00 <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> .
american shooters does n't gouge .
no ` ` gun people .
big ups for that .
here ' s where it gets good .
pro : the sushi is good .
not a big deal .
i like this place .
that by itself makes it worth visiting .
i ' ve been to yardhouse several times .
the food has always been solid .
"other than that , zero complaints ."
the service however is horrible probably one star .
a friend recommend this place .
got there and was <UNK> some banh <UNK> .
it worth the worst i ' ve ever had .
there was no apologies .
this place is a mom-and-pop restaurant .
looking forward to try the rest of the menu .
the service was substandard .
hot and sour soup came out cold .
all was below average .
you can get better food in chinatown .
"simply amazing , everything we ordered was on point ."
second time seeing the show .
well worth the money .
what more can a person ask for in vegas .
a cup of vodka cran was $ 00 .
food was excellent though and service great .
no room for deserts so moved on then !
very disappointed with breakfast here today .
"beware of the greedy , owners wife !"
she could not care less about your experience .
sushi selection was poor .
come see us for your next haircut !
000-000-0000 traditional <UNK> with a family atmosphere .
come see us for your next haircut !
why only four stars ?
"in a word , kevin ."
"instead , this guy kevin comes by ."
fries were simple and tasty .
inside and outside seating available .
a new pizza concept .
"during rush hour , this is a disaster ."
this place is not one of those special ones .
they sell extra expensive food and drinks .
the inferior of the two <UNK> nearby .
lots of bbq places offer sides with their meals .
others say it sucks .
i have an opinion between the two <UNK> .
"the attitude here is very casual , but friendly ."
they have lots of <UNK> machines .
quarters just work for me better .
three and a half stars on this one .
they burned my eggs .
i never had a place burn my eggs before .
the food here is mediocre at best .
my wife ordered the dutch baby .
"no , i ' ll pass on this one ."
"lots of machines , but kind of false advertising ."
there are better options available .
"a nice , clean bowling alley ."
thankfully my wife got in for free .
at least it was cheap .
"seen better , seen worse ."
you have to drive up to the main window .
bosa donuts is ok .
you never know what you are going to find .
maybe someone kicked in a cigarette butt from outside .
nobody seemed able to help him either .
cover charge was $ 0 .
you ' ll find it here .
just about everything tasted terrific .
"` ` matt , what is that ?"
` ` i do n't see anything .
i healed up very quickly .
finding a good one can be tough .
fried zucchini : my wife liked these .
who the fuck runs out of mustard ?
"ketchup tasted weird , overall hamburger taste , mediocre ."
what happened to this place ?
that says a lot to me .
"what ' s the point , really ?"
"but , you need more than that ."
"good , but not good enough ."
"on my second , i had the enchilada sampler ."
give it a try and taste for yourself .
even beats black angus for overall steak taste .
"first , i ' ll talk about the food ."
"fluffy and tasty , they really hit the spot ."
"and of course , the eggs ."
t . c . <UNK> ' s .
these things are gigantic .
that and bottomless drinks - - works for me .
the tacos were really dense and <UNK> .
the problem came later .
let me give you guys the rundown .
the hotel replaced it for no charge .
the menu was pretty monotonous and lacking in variety .
the steak i had was good but fairly fatty .
watch your stuff and 0 .
i wo n't be coming back to this place .
it is absolutely <UNK> .
"often , thai fried rices contain very dry meats ."
"more flavorful , and quite enjoyable ."
i think you ' ll agree .
we found this joint via the eat 00 website .
good curries and fried rices to be found here .
you ' ll get it here .
"okay , let ' s try this ."
this is the only <UNK> in the immediate vicinity .
i came here looking for a hard drive enclosure .
this place is definitely worth repeat visits .
you do n't go here for a bargain .
it ' s like a <UNK> <UNK> .
this is a pretty sucky mcdonald ' s .
down to one star .
so what ' s left ?
"well , the fried zucchini was quite good ."
service was excellent and friendly .
it ' s still the quintessential american diner .
over a dozen samples .
a heart carved out of iron <UNK> ?
maybe just a <UNK> stone ?
"yes , all here and more ."
"this is good , down-home cookin ' ."
"as yelp says , ` ` a-ok ' ' ."
"chips a bit greasy , but tasty ."
they put some money into this place .
"and now , the moment of truth ."
my wife got the beef burro with fundido .
my daughter got a chile relleno plate .
scratch the beans - - they ran out .
from the first bite - - incredible .
that ' s high praise .
remember what i said in my last review ?
it was really not all that good .
the presentation and appearance was pretty nice .
' ' means that the food here is good .
"friendly , <UNK> service ."
rubio ' s is the king of fast food .
sell them at massively expensive prices .
"not perfect , but a sizable and tasty meal ."
i need to revise my review of this place .
and let the beef <UNK> .
this was a welcomed stop in the valley .
tons of junk food rounds out this place .
"ah yes , the game depot ."
got a plumbing problem ?
my wife and i are hailing to the kings .
los reyes de la torta : <UNK> !
the food has changed very little .
i ' m also italian in heritage .
nope - - bird ' s eye .
iceberg lettuce ? italian from san francisco ?
"but no , you decided to insult me instead ."
give these folks a try .
the two hippies made me happy .
the toasted bun was an added plus .
this place is ultra yum .
"yes , and more ."
come to <UNK> ' s hay oasis .
hay by the <UNK> .

"plus , they ' re really friendly folks here ."
' ' that was all i needed to hear .
it was my wife .
i ' ll let you know .
i used to leave this place full .
jimmy & joe ' s eh ?
got ta try that place ... okay .
the shepherd ' s pie was absolutely delicious .
this was getting towards the bottom .
first review of 0000 .
"the meat sauce has a sweet , spicy taste ."
"cheap , fast , great pizza ."
"for the price , you ca n't beat it ."
never mind the furnishings or the decor .
it ' s all about the pizza here .
apparently that was the other tee pee tap room .
i ordered a two enchilada plate .
there are many good mexican restaurants in phoenix .
"$ 0 , all you can eat ."
i need to <UNK> my appreciation for this place .
how about another five star review for this place ?
my daughter liked the fried pickles .
a single burger just ca n't do it justice .
wtf happened to their hamburgers ?
the food is truly <UNK> ' .
kickass asian fast food !
this is the real thing .
"oh , and their pizza is pretty good too ."
this is the ultimate in upholstery supply .
they even have <UNK> <UNK> .
it ' s more than a bar .
<UNK> house is not for the timid .
ryan <UNK> is the rn who runs this spot .
do some shopping and stop by .
five stars - - enthusiastically recommended .
my wife was similarly unimpressed .
i just left food on the table this time .
it ' s got three punches on it .
wow - - now that was a unique treat .
i got the italian ice in <UNK> bing cherry .
"the taste was intense , but just sweet enough ."
this stuff just held together .
just a great sweet treat from start to finish .
"yes , with big hunks of meat ."
ron ' s service is top quality .
service at least was great .
"yeah , it was a burger ."
good but not great .
"not bad , just not exciting ."
did i find it ?
call clean air cab the answer is 0 .
need to call a taxi ?
call these guys - - they did me right .
"apart from that , this place is primo now ."
the pizza itself was nothing really all that special .
we ' ll get pizza here on occasion .
delicious <UNK> mexican food .
valle luna means good <UNK> .
those days are apparently quite long gone .
"and then , there ' s mi patio ."
were they chinese chow mein noodles ?
"but , would i recommend pei wei to anyone ?"
even panda express is better than this place .
wan na swirl it ?
the metal menus also caught my attention .
i was blown away .
you wo n't regret it .
the beef kabobs were ... sublime .
tasty cubes of meat on <UNK> basmati rice .
may i recommend the <UNK> <UNK> ?
this will fill you up fast for $ 0.00 .
this is another five star review for little india .
do n't pass this place up .
try the golden nugget .
the black beans were fair .
looking to have brunch with the wife / hubby ?
the taste and service won us over .
we think you ' ll agree .
lots of options available including veggie .
"somewhat outdated interior , but still pleasant ."
significantly better than your average mexican joint .
looking for some ez money ?
0 gallon water containers and gatorade bottles not accepted .
give them a try .
"for our money , the vdara delivered in spades ."
others may be able to take that stuff .
first review of 0000 .
have a look at the reviews .
detroit coney grill has that special something .
it was noticeable though .
"then , the interior is a bit ... dingy ."
i ' ve seen both .
service is good once you get a room .
wrecked my tongue for the next ten minutes .
service was pretty good .
' ' ` nuff said .
the problem with this place is their drive-thru .
this is not one of those places .
they close early on fridays .
"forget circle k , and <UNK> can bite me ."
it ' s a 00 - hour diner .
nice place for coffee .
the live music is another plus .
that speaks volumes of coolness .
"it ' s something different , done deliciously ."
it ' s worth waiting for .
"cool , a step up from subway ."
i have found my new sandwich shop .
pissed me and my wife off .
does this taste like mine ?
see all those other four and five star reviews ?
it ' s <UNK> mexican food .
talk about an <UNK> enchilada plate .
grossed my ass out .
my wife was equally pleased .
great place for a dinner date with the spouse .
grab yourself a fat burger .
"- rrb - , very very good ."
the tofu was <UNK> .
just kinda wimpy chinese .
they have darts and golden tee .
how could mexican get any better ?
best mexican food in vegas .
keep a look out for there <UNK> and events .
the place had a very nice vibe to it .
"the food was really good , filling and cheap ."
there spicy ramen dish is delicious !
walked in and the place was oozing with garbage !
ordered the # 0 .
at a bagel shop ?
"had there pasta , was watery and flavorless ."
0:00 o'clock rolled around and no one had shown .
i told him the machine was not spinning .
sushi is always great .
this place is amazing .
i specifically asked for a well done crust .
they have a diverse menu .
free gaming if you are a paying customer .
deco is modern and fun .
staff is always friendly and prompt with service .
the guys here kick ass .
the only thing that was good was the beer .
usually the service is adequate .
it seems the kitchen is understaffed .
meatballs are <UNK> but otherwise not a great experience .
i am a regular .
the lamb shank just falls off the bone .
parking is very limited .
we have passed this place up for years .
i highly recommend you try it out .
the first place we ate at was sir <UNK> .
the food seems a bit better .
i hope they try a bit harder this time .
it ' s very noisy .
and the tv ' s do not help .
the entrees arrived without risk to life and limb .
the entire meal should have been taken care of .
i never have to look around for a refill .
you can get a french roll anywhere .
still good but i tried the chicken fried rice .
the chicken was tasteless .
all they did was steam it .
i thought fried rice was an industry standard .
buffet seems bigger than the one at <UNK> .
a cockroach ran up the wall behind my wife .
no manager stopped by .
needless to say we paid for our meal .
we bought some pan <UNK> for the trip home .
the tortilla never broke .
my sandwich was excellent .
my wife enjoyed her meal as well .
first off the view is outstanding .

the food choices however are commendable .
a small piece of heaven in a travelers hell .
chase field is a pretty spectacular ballpark !

very authentic thai food .
rebecca is very professional and focused .
great owners and staff and the food rocks .
i do worry about the cleanliness of the place .
one of the better breakfast places in tempe .
a truly unique dog boutique in the phoenix area .
according to front desk my room was cleaned today .
no new towels and after 0000 no staff .
also pool is broken but on site as useful .
no one cares this is a infection control issue .
if i could give a negative score i would .
this place cost at least 00-00 a night .
might as well been at hooters .
. service was prompt and attentive .
basically a taco bell with decent booze .
weak at best for food .
0 stars only due to the cleanliness and service .
have been to <UNK> a couple times .
great new addition to the aria property .

i found him through yelp and other sites .
this is a bar .
they do it right .
- rrb - they keep a fairly limited menu .
this should be expected .
"if not , you ' re set ."
highly recommended from an experienced hibachi fan .
the food here is stale .
i thought this was a pretty good buffet here .
this is such a cool place .
the drink menu is massive .
the food actually disappointed me .
the herbed gravy was bland .
the mashed potatoes were bland .
something must have changed .
there is a major lack of flavor .
keep in mind this is n't ac or vegas .
there ' s nothing really live or upbeat .
"for an appetizer , i went with the <UNK> ."
"juicy and tender , cooked to perfection ."
this place is great .
this place is really cool .
the shows were very interesting as well .
the food court has some good pizza too .

and do n't charge extra for regular sides .
food was spot on .
the place is huge with a lot of room .
and was n't even cooked right .
the most deelish bbq west of memphis .
quality and quantity above all else .
management and staff deserve all the credit .
the beat tasting wings i have ever had .
not what i expected when i drove there .
the food is exceptional and fair priced .
gives a new definition to the name ihop .
the servers were very friendly though .
three stars based on the service i got .
half a star based on food .
over to you mr . applebee ' s ceo .
was here for a late night snack .
no sandwich is complete without these .
their food is legit thai cooking .
wild thaiger is top notch !
time after time <UNK> gets me to come back .
i had short rib tacos and they were awesome .
always served piping served hot .
limited menu means everything in it is their specialty .
no cheap well drinks at happy hour .
"prices are moderate , food quality is excellent ."
this is my favorite burger restaurant .
all the flavors with each burger work well together .
pho is pretty good i guess .
the saving grace of this place is its location .
they do have a good beer variety .
absolutely fantastic gem of a find .
the pool area is fantastic with gardens all around .
this made the service mediocre at best .
a decent joint for typical american food .
classy french decor with a great patio .
quaint little <UNK> spot downtown middleton .
nice divey spot for a beer .
average place for a campus restaurant .
"however , i was n't as blown away ."
especially since there is no dialogue .
it will get you through the show .
chicken parm was just average .
wait staff was great .
great place for lively music and tasty food .
this is no high class joint .
the super 0 of the strip .
clam chowder was good .
the lasagne was tasty .
try the porterhouse ... awesome !
plenty of coffee and flapjacks for the road .
"they had tons of $ 0.00 , newer movies ."
many titles were $ 0.00 and lower .

about as mediocre as you can get .
"bland , boring american cuisine ."
there are plenty of better options in las vegas .
excellent salad with filet .
tasty wine and mixed drinks .
this is what makes a great restaurant .
the biscuit was about a pound and a half .

i have met a lot of nice people there .

what else can you ask for ?
saw our waiter one time after ordering .
concierge actually picked up the phone .
food was very good .
wait staff was excellent .
food was moderately priced .
i will certainly come back .
the workers seemed to lack adequate training .
the manager was clueless .

lost ac in utah .
"<UNK> , that was some tasty porridge !"
had the california omelette .
i would recommend giving this place a try .
i had the pulled pork sandwich .
awesome place to hang out .
they also have a great community involvement .
this place is a battle between love and hate .
"the food is good , the service is slow ."
the most recent example was this evening .
"also , the drive thru is n't the quickest ."
but they have all been good so far .
dropped in to replace a watch band .
"service was quick , pleasant , helpful ."
best ramen in vegas .
the best italian in las vegas .
"truly authentic , ca n't say enough ."
00oz ribeye is outstanding !
i checked in on-line .
nice place to eat and relax .
the chips and salsa are very good .
overall i was not a fan of my burrito .
"the <UNK> , meat balls are great ."
this place is awesome .
simply the best sunset in the phoenix area .
service made it all the better .
manager did not seem to care - said wow .
. that is odd .
great location great coffee .
never struck me as an italian place .
the sauce was spicy and the meatballs were good .
the meal for everyone was satisfactory .
that made the night better .
probably not unless i have a good coupon .
great subs and great service .
the music was way too loud considering the conditions .
the soft drink selection was not very expansive .
the taste was bland to say the least .
the chocolate cake was very good though .
the food overall was very good .
the desserts were excellent too .
i was about to lose my appetite .

the baked potato was very good too .
i have never had a bad meal at firebirds .

they have an extensive list of beers too .
the tomatillo salsa was very good .

the food at liberty has a distinctive style .
the service was excellent .
the food is good but nothing to rave about .
the food was just ok .
the service overall was good .

the chicken parmesan subs lacked tomato sauce .
the best part was the sub roll .
the cole slaw was especially good .
it was a big meal and a good value .
the place has a comfortable feel .
my wife and mother-in-law ordered the fried chicken .
the food was very good .
it is a good value too .

my first review ever .
"sadly , it continues downhill ."
the southwest eggroll is quite tasty .
the staff has always treated us well .
what a great gym .
amazing job audi keep up the good work
they serve typical bar food and traditional irish food .
been coming here for ten years .
"everything , notably the service , was excellent ."
you do n't need two forms of id here !
it took about three minutes there .
avoid payless at all costs .
not too much but rich .
the fries suck delivered .
the wings are overpriced .
i consider anything over a dollar per wing excessive .
the signature steak sub special was horrid .
the french fries are spectacular .
i think montreal just owns fries in general .
these are all things that peel pub is .
so this broke guy is in .
so what did we do the next day ?
same shit maybe even worse .
shepard ' s pie was fantastic .
a true neighborhood hangout with a bright future .
the waiter was uninformed and could offer no recommendations .
we used to love the pizza here .
"however , recently , they have changed to something ."
"terrible dough , and something bad about the cheese ."
these guys make excellent hoagies .
we especially like the supreme italian and the turkey .
"try their pizza , excellent ."
joe has something great going on here .
theresa does a great job .
"recommend meatball , reuben , burger , fish sandwiches ."
<UNK> sports and sand bar .
epitome of ` ` that guy ' ' .
stretches you and prepares your body for adjustment .
holsteins was very good .
other than that holsteins was great .
an excellent choice when dining in las vegas .
this is why i go to vegas .
all together this place was great .
got the $ 0 <UNK> pork sandwich .
i wonder if it would have mattered ?
this was no exception .
nice final touch to an awesome experience .
great tuna bowl and fried dumplings !
"friendly people , tasty sandwiches ."
really nice discovery in old montreal .
"fresh , great value and very friendly ."
we had wonderful chicken avocado paninis .
iced coffee was top notch .
0-0 tables and a waiter .
we ordered a second round .
the naan is excellent .
i ca n't recall his real name right now .
. and i love the burgers .
0 stars for atmosphere and bar may be cool .
food was average at best ... .
"local recipes , not a chain ."
"steak anything is great , especially the burrito <UNK> ."
great neighborhood pizza and more place .
this is the place .
the service was fast and very good .
my compliments to the chef .
the land and sea platter is also amazing .
"great sushi , great service ."
thanks eric & steve .
steve i go there every couple weeks .
the dinners were art at it ' s finest .
got two of the appetizer combos .
best was the lamb with risotto and short ribs .
the seafood linguini lacked flavor but was good .
the lasagna was excellent .
food was really good for a buffet .
my favorite was the jumbo bbq shrimp with grits .
this is a must do when in vegas .
solid fast mexican food .
"enchiladas , nachos , and rolled tacos are good ."
solid ny style deli .
and the ipa was fantastic .
the black forest and smores .
the donuts were also fresh .
i got the sandwich south of the border .
the waffle part of the sandwich was really flat .
i ' ve had pancakes thicker .
think twice before choosing this location and company .
only one person at the car checkout .
food was absurdly bad .
service was even worse .
"boy , what an upgrade ."
for appetizers we each ordered something different .
"bbq lovers , read this ."
the location is as joint as a joint gets .
"alright , the verdict on the food ."
first off the brisket .
the turkey was also excellent .
"great people , great food , great find ."
basically a no frills pub .
"the good news is , the lobster is phenomenal ."
the <UNK> pie was pretty good as well .
for starters i went with a large <UNK> .
as good as i remember .
two mistakes i made on this .
"all in all , really good first impression ."
among the <UNK> this year was <UNK> .
so i took a pass .
"this time , i took no chances ."
"for starters , yes the oj is great ."
as for the food ?
"well , that could use some work ."
"the place was busy , but not totally full ."
they were very dry and stale tasting .
"for now , the quality has room for improvement ."
been here a couple of times now .
really nice compliment to the beer .
nice to have a decent brewpub downtown .
but thats not the real reason i came .
to me its almost like <UNK> in a sandwich .
"for whatever reason , nothing ever sticks here ."
its probably a little expensive for what it is .
we ' ll see if it has staying power .
so let me briefly lay out my case .
the complex is nice .
a couple pieces of advice .
a couple of <UNK> since last year .
we ' ll see if that holds .
hopefully it stays that way .
not a bad first go around .
"next up , charred ."
great taste profile except for a woefully undercooked crust .
a tiny mini pizza called the full monte .
"it was good , just a different twist ."
sometimes i just want a burger .
the sweet potato fries and the accompanying sauces .
or more specifically a location within a chain .
but the downtown phoenix location is different .
"first off , the burrito itself is huge ."
this stuff surprised me in a number of ways .
some might call that a scam .
"<UNK> , its almost never crowded ."
as was the case today .
enter the biltmore at 00th street and missouri .
"burgers , sandwiches , omelets , the usual suspects ."
"but so far , no dice ."
"no lines , no pretentiousness , no <UNK> ."
<UNK> very well with the clarendon ' s decor .
are they trying to be a pizzeria ?
let ' s start with the quesadilla .
they were more than adequate .
having wait staff helps guide customers at their pace .
nice <UNK> reuse of this property .
"but what they do have , they do right ."
the location for the brewery is absolutely perfect .
"alright , rant over ."
really good beer compliment .
so close to microbrewery perfection .
"the simplest answer is , well , simplicity ."
a simple margherita pizza .
a very nice cap to the meal .
perfectly fits in with the arts scene on roosevelt .
a couple of pointers .
the diner itself truly is a <UNK> .
"more specifically , the big jim ."
first impressions are mixed .
also got a side of fries .
"including the beer , it was a great lunch ."
"overall , a decent opening impression ."
a quick update on desoto .
the bad : - - the bar .
"so far , the restaurants dominate the interior landscape ."
each has its charm .
"nothing great or amazing , nothing bad or disgusting ."
the quintessential suburban barbecue spot .
and surprisingly none of us felt overwhelmingly full .
hard to beat that .
"finding local , high quality sushi ?"
"yeah , good luck ."
today i finally took the plunge .
seats about 00-00 folks from what i could tell .
three stars is pretty spot on .
"alright , to the grub ."
"and as mentioned before , our waitress was excellent ."
made my second trip here last night .
both dishes are tasty and well-prepared with excellent presentation .
even the bar area feels very homey .
really outstanding little deli and bagel shop .
the sandwich was fantastic .
all with different spice levels and seasonings .
the verdict on the fish tacos ?
maybe next time i ' ll go that route .
absolutely fantastic and at a great price .
"great tacos , great prices , great hidden gem ."
"total cost , $ 00 ."
"high prices , average food ."
"on the plus side , our bartender was excellent ."
i gave him a generous tip for his efforts .
and you ' d be justified in doing so .
there ' s actually three parts to this place .
prices for this place are n't cheap .
"first off , this is a fantastic space ."
the old <UNK> residence actually contains two restaurant spaces .
thumbs up for this starter .
"still , a pretty enjoyable dish ."
perhaps a dollar here or there .
"on the whole , i was pretty impressed ."
historical <UNK> with a personality .
"i mean c'mon , donuts are basically perfect ."
a quick tip if you ' re coming here .
overall a cool little spot .
"it was adequate , but did n't wow me ."
not enough bang for the buck .
much more like a chipotle than a tacos <UNK> .
we both got the carne asada burrito meal .
tonight i went for arguably their most signature dish .
"wow , talk about tender ."
the meat practically melts in your mouth .
that butter would taste good on almost anything .
complements the pie slice very well .
my experience was almost perfect .
the vibe here is pretty straight forward .
the caprese was outstanding .
for the pizza i did the bufala <UNK> .
"cibo and bianco , you ' ve got company ."
cibo and bianco have been put on notice .
quality of the beef was excellent .
"ticket was $ 0 , while the 00 oz ."
"with tip and tax , total was $ 00 ."
should that experience come at more of a discount ?
it comes 0 to a plate .
the caramel sauce was pretty unreal .
multiple take out boxes were used on this night .
"wow , talk about refreshing ."
holy moly was this awesome .
"okay , a little disclaimer for bias ."
little did i know the following this place had .
do n't let this scare you away though .
especially if you live in the central phoenix area .
brought my girlfriend and another friend .
today i decided to have a yellowfin tuna poke .
i also got a glass of the <UNK> noir .
refreshing accompaniment to the poke for sure .
so back to the drawback of this place .
came here with most of my immediate family tonight .
"still , a good flavorful and relatively light sandwich ."
"overall , a nice neighborhood spot ."
"the customers , the staff , hipsters everywhere ."
also got an oj to wash it all down .
total price was about $ 00 .
the crepe was absolutely awesome .
the scramble was also impressive .
excellent breakfast to start my sunday .
a nice laid back neighborhood haunt .
as for the food ?
for dessert i went with the cherry lava cake .
total cost was about $ 00 .
came out in just over 0 minutes .
the sandwich was huge and the ingredients were fantastic .
for dessert my girlfriend and i tried two things .
now these did not disappoint .
"as mentioned earlier , the atmosphere is relatively blah ."
"so bravo yelpers , you win again ."
total price was $ 00 .
the photos on yelp are n't lying .
the meats were also very well prepared .
"including , apparently , vincent <UNK> ."
the menu offers one of three different dining options .
paired very well with the wines we had .
"but you know what , its worth every penny ."
"its a caloric nightmare , but its absolutely awesome ."
this place draws people from all walks of life .
the pulled pork was very good and plenty moist .
"bottomline , its not little miss bbq ."
nice find in the phoenix suburbs .
kind of an asian version of green .
not nearly as dressy as i expected .
then came the main course .
it was a <UNK> shrimp with green papaya .
super moist cake and the sauce was excellent .
made the experience that much better .
<UNK> important during the summer when the mercury <UNK> .
food prices are ludicrous .
and that feeling carries into the food .
"now , to the food ."
overall i like what chef <UNK> has going here .
without question the best restaurant experience of my life .
"period , end of story ."
coming here is a like a time warp .
so what do i do ?
i really liked the honey lavender my girlfriend had .
both of her scoops tasted very light .
"yeah , i know , fail on my part ."
but better late than never .
there ' s a couple of counter areas inside .
lots of flavor in this thing .
"but overall , good solid chop ."
"the side dishes were good , but nothing special ."
really nice little neighborhood bar .
and the drinks from the <UNK> were on point .
my girlfriend was a happy camper with that one .
"as mentioned , its pretty small ."
the building itself is spectacular .
so just to recap .
five stars for the ambiance and the friendly service .
no issues on either front there .
but two stars for the food .
"not bad , just different ."
it was like a really hot chicken wing .
"at long last , my first visit to lux ."
"good food , quirky setup , crazy busy ."
"but like lgo , this place is an exception ."
the food was pretty solid .
the bacon was fantastic .
"as for the pancake , mixed feelings on this ."
"wow , were those awesome ."
the pulled pork was tender as can be .
"the green beans were good , but nothing special ."
great way to cap off the evening .
great improvement from their old location on 00th avenue .
"pizza is decent , though nothing special ."
and now a great place to watch a game .
a little background on this .
"and like the okonomiyaki , huge in portion ."
"tasty , but mostly forgettable ."
a really unexpected treat at an already solid restaurant .
my one disappointment was the beer and wine list .
would gladly take friends here .
great value for the price you pay .
the location is exactly what i expected .
took about 00 minutes to get my food .
great burrito all around .
"again , just as delicious as their main location ."
made the experience that much better .
but no the gap is n't that wide .
i had scrambled eggs with sausage and toast .
the chips themselves were excellent actually .
i also got a modelo especial beer to drink .
so i went with that .
the mole dish i got was $ 00 .
"nothing really distinctive , but comfortable nevertheless ."
the pie was outstanding .
bianco has no dessert offerings .
"some hits , some misses ."
first the po boy .
next came the the <UNK> .
no missing meat on this dish .
"the clams were pretty mellow , but good ."
total for the dishes plus tax was $ 00 .
"simple , stick to your ribs goodness ."
on the west side of downtown is cibo .
on the east side of downtown is bianco .
in north central downtown is pomo .
my girlfriend and i came on a wednesday night .
probably explained the light <UNK> .
the place was much busier than my last visit .
its a pretty manly dish .
an insane wine and beer selection .
the rice was pretty much what i expected .
and the tortillas i got were enormous .
"in summary , its a start ."
both were as good as i remember .
the food here is pretty stand bar fare .
"good call yelpers , good call ."
"for starters , excellent brisket ."
"c'mon tammie , i know you can do better ."
my favorite pizza in all of the phoenix area .
"bravo pomo , you never cease to amaze ."
"the prep time , and the portions ."
total cost was $ 00 .
i guess this is the normal prep time ?
the texture of the tortilla was perfect .
so what am i doing here ?
a lack of traditions .
"josh , you ' ve been put on notice ."
the west side wants their miracle mile back .
just had my first experience at this place .
"the drink choices were minimal , but good ."
so the overall verdict ?
is it worthy of all the hype ?
first trip here in awhile .
"second , they now have dessert offerings ."
it ' s good pizza .
it ' s national pie day ?
total for the two mini pies was $ 00 .
here ' s a couple of tips : 0 .
work your way from lightest concoctions to <UNK> .
you ' ll feel good helping them out too .
for the appetizer we got the crispy rice asparagus .
"not bad , but not what i anticipated ."
basically reads like a greatest hits menu .
we washed it down with some saki of course .
great deal with the discount .
but thats just me .
four of us split two main dishes .
the mahi-mahi and the pork tenderloin .
a great fit in the exploding downtown food scene .
had a terrific burger here for dinner .
"dijon sauce , sauerkraut , and swiss cheese ."
i just sat up front this go around .
the shepherd ' s biscuit .
one look at my meal will settle that question .
as for the taste ?
"great experience , great value ."
"coronado folks , that spot has arrived ."
ron can recommend items depending on your taste .
the cooked veggies were prepared very simple .
"and of course , the main event ."
big time props to you ron .
or i might just dominate that salmon again .
either way it ' s a win-win .
and until recently i never suspected i would .
"wow , wow , wow ."
a slice of their <UNK> del <UNK> .
"a deliciously smooth , creamy and surprisingly light dessert ."
the menu looked fairly simple but tasty .
really excellent quality lunch for the price .
"west valley yelpers , go get yourself some sammiches ."
the interior is hard to describe .
a footlong super sicilian .
total cost including water and tax was $ 0 .
"that said , the place was n't crazy noisy ."
"very casual , comfortable atmosphere inside ."
"so yeah , four stars is probably about right ."
"that ' s a pretty simple dish , right ?"
this one was a little bit disappointing .
they say its all natural with orange flower water .
everything was spot on .
the flavors were superb .
the price was right .
"a quick tip , park behind the restaurant ."
five stars for a sports bar ?
"most shockingly , the food ."
all in a cast iron skillet .
"again , a solid dish ."
"yes , its enormous and yes its awesome ."
this is n't your run of the mill rice .
its <UNK> traditional and delivers a wonderfully tasty experience .
forget for a moment that this place is vegan .
for a drink i went with lemonade .
the service we received was excellent .
"for starters , this restaurant has been around forever ."
tonight i went with the chicken <UNK> .
a heavenly burger to be sure .
the chances of you getting hooked are quite high .
"the more questionable the neighborhood , the better ."
who does n't love a good neighborhood burger joint ?
notice a theme here ?
the burger was excellent .
"otherwise , a decent starter dish ."
the place was packed .
as for the food ?
the appetizers were probably a 0.0 out of 0 .
the main courses were an improvement .
thats about right to me .
now to the food .
as expected it was outstanding .
"overall though , cool place and great food ."
just make sure your vocal <UNK> are adequately prepared .
will the newest concept stick ?
asian chicken and donuts ?
"much to my surprise , the place was packed ."
"without hesitation , he said the maple bacon ."
been here a couple of times .
i ' ll leave that up to you .
too much of a shock to my bank account .
"you guessed it , walked into the wrong door ."
"just as i expected , it was outstanding ."
"still , the markup seems a little steep ."
clearly a place thats proud of it reputation .
most of us got dessert to finish things off .
but after 0: 00 pm the place was packed !
you like old school ?
now for the food .
for dinner i got the 00 oz .
but this one was close .
all the richness you ' d expect and more .
"because , well why not ."
only these beignets came with caramel to dip in .
so how does federal stack up ?
a group of us played some shuffleboard as well .
to start the evening i had the pork bun .
"small , simple , but bursting with flavor ."
great way to start things off .
at least based on my initial experience .
"the cornbread was , unusual ."
"not good or bad i guess , just different ."
the thick cut noodles were also quite good .
i started with an app of irish sausage rolls .
<UNK> that however you wish .
what i found most pleasantly surprising was their burgers .
"cheap , local , delicious ."
"first off , my gyro was huge ."
"despite its sheer size , i demolished it ."
clearly the buzz is still going strong here .
here its all about the salads .
anyways to the food .
that ' s what <UNK> does best .
count me in i said .
great texture and tasty filling in each .
$ 0 for three pretty small pierogis ?
<UNK> <UNK> is such a chef .
so here ' s where it can get dicey .
"first off , the beers ."
"not bad , just a little unexpected ."
and how about serving true <UNK> food ?
as for the food ?
"decent flavor , a little oily ."
hit the spot on every note .
not bad for all the food that i got .
"her pasta though , wow ."
the atmosphere is pretty quintessential scottsdale .
a mix of fine dining with a trendy vibe .
"yeah , no thanks ."
"that said , there are some drawbacks ."
"all in all , its more than adequate ."
"healthy portion , but a pretty simple dish ."
was a good meal ?
was it a great meal ?
ca n't say that with as much confidence .
this really was a shot in the dark .
perhaps the lunch crowd had n't yet flowed in .
good price for a good amount of food .
i ' ll investigate that possibility the next time .
"overall , a good choice , yelpers ."
professional wash for a excellent price .
clean fresh delicious coffee .
friendly and intelligent staff .
everything was delivered on time and exactly as discussed .

water kept going empty .
i am that kind of greedy eater .

and then wondered if anyone was working ?
there was football and basketball on .
and they were playing ... <UNK> ?
` ` rush hour ' ' !
that must mean they get that shit ready fast !
"no sweat , right ?"
<UNK> ' d a couple hungover girls stumbling in .
but we did n't see shit going on .
"0 minutes later , my sandwich got there ."
what kind of response is that ?
and they gave us the wrong bagels .
and them damn things cost like 0 bucks .
- ca n't get basic orders right .
- manager ' s a jerk .
the food is awesome .
the chicken katsu is my personal favorite .
and the loco moco is pretty legit .
i ' m an asshole .
i really was an asshole .
"the kiltlifter was fantastic , as i expected ."
but the problem lies in the staff .
damn what great service and staff .
very cool place here .
monte carlo and had lots of beer .
the place is extremely sport oriented .
outside there are nfl flags of every team hanging .
food : burgers and burgers and more burgers .
they also have a burger challenge .
other times have been other problems .
i will avoid this location .
you get what you expect .
eggs were fluffy and nice large portions were served .
best healthy mexican food around .
this place is the best around .
no one can compare to their cuisine .
you get what you expect .
this place is a hidden gem .
great middle eastern food at a great price .
food was tasty but a bit bland .
i am willing to give it another shot .
you get what you expect .
at the time my wife was 0 months pregnant .
good deal if you want cheap chinese lunch .
go somewhere else if you want good thai food .
the ladies were really nice .
my wife ordered a carne asada fajita .
the quantity is right up there with the quality .
the service was exceptional .
i was very happy with the end result .
they have no cars ... for anybody .
not sure how this works as a business .
"the burgers are good , but overpriced ."
"the burger was good , but not worth 00 ."
that ' s what this place is .
the bacon wrapped dates are not to be missed .
best punk bar in vegas !
"yah , but what is n't in vegas ?"
"i dunno , but you should ask these people ."
"this is upscale , for real , but hip ."
and that suits me just fine .
this place is run by cheap bastards .
i have eaten here before .
"that said , it is well worth the search ."
fantastic food & service .
the lines are n't usually bad either .
service was just average .
ordered because of 0 star rating .
this place is garbage .
super clean chinese grocery store .
"good and real chinese dim sum , so far ."
serving speed is also fast .
the food was always good there .
cons : no real good tasting chinese food .
service is awesome and fast .
taste is definitely top tier in madison .
what is missing for a five star ?
"imho , it is a killer entree ."
"real farm food , real good dishes ."
"so , <UNK> , it was such a failure ."
a good solid cab that covers the madison proximity .
i had the steak kabob plate .
the steak was tough .
cherry blossom roll is interesting .
average breakfast food at best .
decent pizza ... good for the price .
great drunk food and it stays open till late .
their croissant breakfast sandwich is n't bad either .
this changes my view on what good bread is .
the nutella ice cream is awesome .
this place is a gem in south phoenix .
the philly cheese steaks are amazing .
their beef chow fun is legit .
good sushi and the prices are n't that bad .
first time in the las vegas location .
i liked the po boy it was quite spicy .
chicken + waffles = food coma .
buy meat buy the pound !
the moist brisket and ribs were awesome .
everything else is usually a miss .
one of the gems in phoenix .
i found a good taco shop .
the food was excellent .
- the butter burger could ' ve been better .
their mozzarella tomato sandwich is simply delicious .
beef gyros are always good here .
they expanded and the chili dogs are still awesome .
the lamb with mustard mint was interesting .
they used to be $ 0 .
definitely worth the trip and for sure good eats .
saw them while i was driving by and stopped .
nice guys and good reasonably priced food .
give these guys a shot !
employees seem to be purposely moving in slow motion .
"best chinese in pgh , hands down ."
the food is superlative .
everything else is to the same standard .
"well , maybe they hired someone new ."
things went downhill from there .
nowhere near as good as normal .
what gives ? ? ? rip mekong .
mr ramsay popped out .
the shakes were pretty amazing .
makes sense i suppose .
we started with the ox tail chili fries .
"impressively good , it disappeared quickly ."
the taxes here are insane .
"' ' ` ` ok , no problem ."
". ` ` whatever , fine ."
"yes , a very 0 star experience ."
"if you ' re a fan , go there ."
about $ 00-00 for a burger .
"nice dã © cor , located inside the casino ."
service was friendly and efficient but not <UNK> .
selection was very good .
but it took 00 minutes to get seated .
that pumpkin ice cream was unedible .
so my wife did n't like the <UNK> smell .
my wife went to see a movie .
so a really nice cinema complex .
i ate at the garden buffet several years ago .
did i mention this sucks ?
a steady stream of customers in and out .
the portions were rather small compared to german portions .
lots of kiss memorabilia and merch .
some games and video games inside as well .
this food has always been high quality .
plenty of rolls for those that want it .
they have a ramen bar .
"the sound , lights were awesome ."
no problems hearing anything from the cheap seats .
the bar during intermission was rather slow .
i started to feel kind of bad for them .
"bottom line - cool , but no value ."
"and the basement had early man , <UNK> <UNK> ."
geared toward younger crowds so no information overload .
"admittedly , there is n't much to see ."
it ' s basically one wall .
"sweet , looks like a winner ."
good but rather simple .
"small place , probably only room for about 00 ."
"the omelet was fresh , tasty ."
but the food is on-point .
"seriously , the food is great here ."
and i already mentioned expensive .
"i appreciate art , but certainly not a <UNK> ."
kids are free and retired military was $ 00 .
the problem was there was only one waitress .
went to see living colour on 0 october .
my complaint is the pricing .
the family price is $ 00 .
the main course was the american filet .
the tickets stated 0pm show .
. get your ticket scanned .
. so here are the prices .
. $ 00 dollars for them .
you wo n't be disappointed .
the one star is because yelp made me .
the food and service were ok .
<UNK> decent sushi option .
"sat quickly , good service , nice ambiance ."
"typical vegas resort pricing , no value here ."
. which is unacceptable from a chain like bjs .
. i ca n't get a bad meal here .
. true true stuff .
. cheap good food all day and night .
. so off to a bad start .
. pretty easy stuff .
service at the bar is excellent and friendly .
a few things that seemed weird ... 0 .
the stench lingered though and it was horrible .
breakfast was buffet style and the staff was exceptional .
"for us , that is a good sign ."
i have had better service at mcdonald ' s .
excellent service and food .
the bad news was our server .
"three days later , no call ."
a very updated and modern version of mongolian bbq .
"very satisfied with the portion , taste and service ."
damn i may be the you <UNK> !
"awesome bar , can be a bit loud !"
bring your attitude and you ' ll fit right in

good news is the food was rather tasty .

decent dry cleaners but kind of a dump .
food is above average but the value is average .
wait times during lunch can be quite long .
been here a few times .
the best pizza in pgh .
"not your typical pizza , more euro in approach ."
not cheap on the meat like some stores .
standard chain in market square .
for me the menu is weak .
cheap and bad for you .
fries with gravy is the best .
going to the o is a pgh experience .
recommended chain sub shop .
much better than subway .
"needs to improve the bread , a bit denser ."
and hectic during lunch .
a step or two above subway .
not <UNK> but solid .
bland americanized mexican food .
standard upscale chain steakhouse .
"good food , etc . but nothing memorable ."
expensive but you know that going in .
good value for your money .

recommend for a dive pizza meal .
do n't expect atmosphere as it does not exist .
great food but on the pricy side .
not a chain so that is a plus .
sweet woman owns and operates the store .
same scenario played out at our destination city .
<UNK> was tasty and the sushi very good .
<UNK> have joined <UNK> with fine dining .
good is great but will not return .
reminds me of my decade in houston tx .
best tortillas ever ! ! best .
internet is really slow .
they took me right after i finished my paperwork .
also waitress knew nothing about the beer selection .
she knew nothing about any other beer .
finally got a beer after eating my meal .
burger ok but not so good without a beer !
hands down my favorite tacos ever .
"dark , indian like curry sauce ."
probably ate enough for mercury <UNK> .
but it was worth it .
small doors open to a palace of thai deliciousness .
he is simply the best !
owner mr . wang refuse to repair it .
your job is taking care of your customer .
"however , i was widely impressed by the burgers ."
the spicy lamb burger was very good .
"my favorite , though , was the peppercorn burger ."

only in las vegas .
everything on the menu is surprisingly cheap .
my girlfriend loved the pan fried noodles .
the food here is fantastic .
anything i would say would be redundant .
but no place compares to the beef jerky store .
"shut up , yes you do ."
and that ' s not all .
just try to avoid all the <UNK> pan handlers .
the service is excellent .
forget the overpriced buffets on the strip .
forget the <UNK> hipster nonsense downtown .
' ' just keep moving ahead .
there ' s also the famous steak special .
they also advertise the monster burger for $ 0.00 .
you will not leave hungry .
things do n't get much better when you enter .
"sorry about that , yard house ."
"because people should know about this place , dammit ."
' ' just keep moving ahead .
there ' s also the famous steak special .
they also advertise the monster burger for $ 0.00 .
you will not leave hungry .
a few other thoughts .
the coffee is bad .
i ' ve very rarely been disappointed .
the menu looked to be nearly identical .
it really made the wait time easy and enjoyable .
by far one of the coolest places in vegas .
"a nice break from the neon , glitz ."
bin 000 is a definite highlight .
chorizo and manchego cheese cut perfectly and flavorful .
"and , lastly , the service was spot on ."
nice to have a server with an opinion .
"great food , great service ."
the nigiri is fresh and the portions are large .
i ' m an experienced <UNK> <UNK> .
typical <UNK> inventory and retail pricing .
"well priced , ca n't rave enough ."
needless to say we were greatly disappointed .
their spread is limited .
based on yelper ' s recommendation ... 0 .
the room was smaller than my hotel room .
main on tray good but small portion .
my first time here and the food was excellent .
they have a new customer for life .

chris second time back to the wing counter .
the wings were excellent .
service is top notch .
will be back again .
"and , very loud ."
my wife ordered pappardelle an a glass of wine .
$ 0 beer was tasty though .
disneyland ends up being cheaper and far better .
rick and jesse are awesome !
paper napkins always bad with $ 00 entrees .
"oh , and fried calamari and wine and beer ."
calamari sauce was great .
who is cooking here ?
- lrb - $ 00 special ?
maybe it ' s normal here ?
cooks make dollar menu items .
the food was awesome .
all were very good .
another word - lrb - s - rrb - .
that ' s all there is to it .
the house made mozzarella is an inspiration .
you will not regret it .
i ' m an interior designer .
you wo n't be disappointed at lon ' s .
what can i say about <UNK> ?
definitely worth checking out .
i think you ' ll be glad you did .
"for the price , the food is fantastic ."
this place is great to check out .
i ' m sure you ' ll like it .
i really enjoyed this place .

definitely 0 star food .
it ' s a real ` ` <UNK> !
i like this place .
upgrade from 0 to 0 stars takes effect now .

this place is definitely worth checking out .
i like the rokerij .
the food is good and the atmosphere is great .
still - a solid 0 stars .
definitely go to tortas el <UNK> .
noble beast is great .
definitely worth checking out .
great chicken salad sandwich !

if i could give them zero stars i would .
same day delivery with these guys is a joke .
are they opposed to tips ?
doubt that i will be back .
mild wings for me ... cool .
while in vegas i happened upon this place .
they ate cheap and dont know values of guns .
june 00th at 0:00 pm .
cooks do not use gloves when touching your food .
not much of an order selection .
this trip was in <UNK> of 0000 .
"its hip , novel and cool ."
the best is how it looks upon arrival .
"looked for a lid , all out of medium ."
"and the floor , my word !"
this does n't happen in an hour or two .
just gives <UNK> to the other reviews .
i have family visiting from out of town .
so i eventually just ate it .
"disinterested , slow , unhelpful ."
great authentic italian food with warm personable service .
you must try the veal parmigiano .
house wines are excellent .
the food here is awesome .

these guys and gals know their stuff .
you will be corrected if a correction is needed .
the community is great .
you will not be disappointed .

cant say enough good stuff about this place .
bison burger blew my mind .
installers were fast and professional .
salesman and staff fair and easy to deal with .
i cant recommend these enough .
it was well worth picture of vegas .
the hallway is clean .
lots of choices but no crab legs .
there are lots of buddha figurines in different sizes .
i prefer a balance flavor broth .
the price for the beef noodle soup is fair .
the service is unpredictable .
since there is not much service that seems rediculous .
might as well order a beer for your thirst .
this new restaurant seems very promising .
handlebar and mellow mushroom also crush this place .
the pasta was fine .
the marlin in particular had a very pleasant consistency .
"late review , but still relevant ."
shame since it is down the street .
bachi has lost it ' s mojo as well .
why not capture as much business as possible ?
dr . <UNK> is awesome .
"very nice , very helpful ."
the only place i will go .
the food comes out when it comes out .
ridiculous ! ! very friendly staff .
recommend the torta <UNK> and the carne asada fries .
great standard thai food that elevates above standard .
the food here deserves your patronage .
best mexican in vegas ?
great smell walking into the place .
i will be back again .
the food and drinks are standard at beat .
have n't been here in years .
the ones you use are terrible .
also the burger patties are frozen and disgusting .
this place has horrible customer service .
that ' s about it .
now the bad news .
first : the beer .

- rrb - buffalo : boring and poorly seasoned .
finally : the price .
avoid it if good food means anything to you .
the location in downtown chandler is terrific for us .
the burger was very tasty .
but we keep trying to find places to love .
bld may be one of those places .
these were just right .
my coffee was terrific .
bld got the coffee right .
"good job , bld ."

the flavors are subtle and nicely balanced .
i ordered a traditional gin martini .
"yeah , it was pretty good ."
caroline had the deconstructed coffee .
service : counter service .
"friendly , in a swedish kinda way ."
it took 00 minutes to get a chicken wrap .
00 minutes for a chicken wrap ?
blue hound nails it on all fronts .
this guy is good .
deviled eggs : this one is surprising .
they are dangerous mouth popping snacks .
sun will shine through in the morning .
this is what a bar experience should be like !
menu is influenced with new england style seafood options .
do n't come for the chicken wings .
sour cream worked really well with it .
all were fantastic and more than enough food .
"great views , great service , great food ."
service was very good as was the meal .
the drive-thru guy is very courteous .
the burgers are good .
the fries are great .
"may be 0 minutes , may be 00 ."
we appreciated her honesty but decided to go .
that is simply unacceptable .
the lack of attention comes second .
there was nobody who looked managerial in sight .
i ' ve been there 0 times now .
the food was excellent though .
i had the mexican mule .
very good as well .
their prices are pretty average for the area .
"i ordered online from their website , <UNK> ."

' ' def got ta check this place out .
outside setup is pretty cool in the night time .
the stacked enchiladas was excellent as well .
this place was just over a-ok .
probably wo n't be going back again .
service : i wanted to start with this .
dessert : chocolate lava cake with gelato .
chicken noodle out of this world .
"the service , atmosphere and food all top notch ."
warm and inviting and at the same time efficient .
"' ' round 0 , deserts ."
avoid at all costs .

egg on the burger was n't completely cooked .
so far <UNK> wears the crown .
uncle josh does tremendous work .
all four came out looking great .
do n't get delivery for this place .
keep coming back for more .
they were virtually everywhere .
ordered a <UNK> ' s bourbon .
asked for one with one ice cube .
"fat tire , son ."
i certainly ca n't complain about that .
not sure what all the fuss is here .
perhaps that explains all the high reviews .
a nice coffee house in downtown vegas .
i came here twice for that very reason .
my wife too liked her sandwich .
where the heck were all the beers ?
"well , how about the quality of the selection ?"
"either way , bad business ."
great billiards bar on montford .
this place is great .

food was good and prepared perfectly .

i would not recommend this to a friend .
"great food , cocktail , and beer menu ."
"pretty good pizza , did n't impress too much ."
give them a try .
pretty affordable food offset the ridiculously expensive sake .
right inside the caesars forum shops at the valet .

the cuisine is consistently good .
the pricing is reasonable .
the staff is friendly and attentive .
her recommendation by the way .
their buffet pricing was at 00.00 for weekend .

you will know that you had greek .
sounds like stealing to me .
this a nice place to take a date .

drinks and food is way overpriced .
all in all a bad experience .
horrible do not waist your time .
i was probably here at the worst possible time .
the staff was completely overwhelmed by the lunch rush .
the food was excellent an the service was amazing .
avoid this <UNK> at all costs .
now called venti ' s ... mmmmm .

it will be served undercooked and cold .
the food quality is horrible .
"unfortunately , i found no such thing at dozen ."
the menu is quite varied .
good food - lrb - mostly - rrb - .
things get really tight in there though .
i would give it 0.0 stars if i could .
summertime brings great seafood specials like the seared scallops .
staff is nice and consistently busy .
great food but a bit messy .
weekday crowds are much lighter .
"all in all , this diner is a classic ."
they have great food and a great atmosphere .
definitely my favorite pizza place in madison .
the service was excellent as well .
the service deserves far less than four stars .
the outdoor porch on a summer day is excellent .

another bout of <UNK> silence and staring .
i will certainly be heading back .

excellent environment to enjoy some sa food .
we ordered starters and slices .
nothing great on the pizza just good i guess .

this place is exactly what lothian road needed .
"good selection of beers , ciders and lager ."
the spirit selection is n't bad either .

the decor is great low ceilings with wooden beams .
massive queues out the shop onto the street .
hey ho you live and learn .

the ramen was good along with the spice .
on the other hand the gyoza was okay .
the place looked pretty cool .
' ' the artichoke hearts were pretty good .
"i got the border burger , it was great ."
any option you might want they have .
this is the case every time .
nobody is doing anything .
the food is mediocre at best .
the salmon burger was very good .
the place is pricey - no argument there .
the bread variety was quite delicious - esp .
the olive and rye breads .
the price is moderate but nothing completely unreasonable .
the service and finished product was fine .
the food was bland and took forever .
"carnegie ai n't it , folks ."
just a great show to experience .

the motif is cool - retro furniture and ambiance .
drinks are moderate but not terribly overpriced .
this bar is pure vintage .
<UNK> street is where my club life began .

one of the best burgers i have had .
place lived up to the hype .
just try not to get shot getting there .
excellent little korean restaurant .
chicken parm was filling and delicious .
very cool setting for a nice dinner .

good luck getting more of anything from this restaurant .
the gyro was good but not amazing .
do yourself a favor and try somewhere else .
the menu was small and underwhelming .
outstanding chicken ` ` under a brick .
' ' excellent service at the bar .
"to top it off , the tamales were outstanding ."
"lastly , the portions are not tiny ."

avoid at all costs .
"- patrick , tempe , az"
great bartender and excellent food at great prices !
each table had a <UNK> built inside of it .
this trip was n't without its negatives .
they should have someone clean it up .
it took forever to be served .
"yes , this is a <UNK> target on stilts ."
it earns it an extra star for architectural creativity .
bread came out burnt and the sirloin was rare .
"pros : clean , modern , great views ."
check in and out were fast .
so good i ordered the truffle marrow filet .
everything i had was delicious and beautifully presented .
my wife and i bought a new mattress here .

it is las vegas .
the food is good .
the side of asparagus was also tasty .
the dessert tickled the taste bud as well .

extremely friendly and willing to help you .
well worth the money .
this is a gem of eatery .

best fried cheese curds .
soooooo superior to subway .
very authentic and high quality .
"sadly , the same company delivered ."
too bad cuz they had some good food .
"sucks now , it ' s a bitch gym ."
one star for scenery but thats it .
"drunken morons , <UNK> , fights , and police ."
find something else to do .
not a bad place .
this place is a little hard to find .
they make a variety of hand pies from scratch .
excellent food and atmosphere .
when you go try the tsoynami deserts .
very beautiful plants and a real nice walk .
these guys are great .
not even a whole hotdog .
clearly a ton of profit for them .
more like chicken nuggets .
"courteous beyond belief , both michael and juan ."
time to find a new place .
' ' then thai lotus is for you .
"admittedly , this is on the nicer end too ."
da vang is a 0 - star restaurant .
it ' s as simple as that .
"good food , good service , and good prices ."
oh yeah - - this walmart is the pits .
"as others have mentioned , it ' s slow ."
does this location not staff ?
is the staff not trained ?
does the staff not care ?
is the equipment not functional ?
does the equipment not care ?
bookmark it and hit it up .
you ' ll agree with me .
carly ' s is a great little joint .
i get the execution .
"as good as it gets , indeed ."
how could this be a big deal though ?
it ' s a local chain diner .
"if you have been to tucson , for example ."
one should expect more than the typical fox <UNK> .
big ups to just <UNK> .
<UNK> is a nice little <UNK> hike .
we went to zipps to watch college football .
probably a 0 star sports bar experience .
do n't have to toss in a business card .
my personal recommendation is the stuffed baker .
<UNK> ... status update !
is there a yelp <UNK> badge ?
who does n't like dq ?
"___ in all , it ' s a dump ."
definitely worth a stop .
"could it be better , absolutely ."
"but , hey , it is what it is ."
but so would another world series title .
the interior is cool and comfortable .
well look no further .
pretty standard cheap pizza and wings fare .
go to blueberry hill .
"that said , the <UNK> is nice ."
just a very legit mexican dining experience .
nothing i can do for you here .
but that ' s part of vegas .
it gets so old .
pricey for a lowly fast food restaurant .
this starbucks is losing it .
"really , it ' s good ."
"great coffee , friendly service , and good food ."
so that ' s oregano ' s .
you know the soup nazi episode of seinfeld ?
its a solid five stars .
the interior is awesome .

federal pizza is my favorite upward project .
looking on yelp for the best indian food option .

so why two stars ?
would not recommend this location .
well worth the money .
great schedule with several options each day .
please to do not waste your time or money .
i would work with them again in a heartbeat .
"best , and most authentic british pub in charlotte ."
excellent place for an omelet .
"service is always good , and the food excellent ."
after reading the reviews for <UNK> plumbing on yelp !
they ' re doing great .
keep it up jinya .
"crab cakes were great , also the onion straws ."
then dinner got poor .
both came out properly cooked .
problem was is that their was no taste .
massive <UNK> of salt did not help .
and we do n't normally use salt .
poor quality has no place in this operation .
their presentations is clean and fits perfectly .
i could throw down a <UNK> without thinking twice .
these guys need places to sit for people .
and the bar crowd occasionally scares people off .
but this review is for the food .
and it ' s great .
"problem was , horrible and i mean horrible service ."
took forever to get a beer .
"well , folks you are missing out ."
he made us great omelets at 0:00 pm .

this time i tried the lobster and pasta dish .
my wife had the pork belly .
"the verdict - - good food , excellent service ."
the taste was great as i expected .
yahoo give me more of it baby !
i ordered chicken pot pie with mashed potatoes .
the minced chicken in lettuce cups was bland .
the spare rib was really tough .
definitely worth a stop .
just inside ph from the mgm grand side .
prices equally compared to panera .
get the 00 magnum .
security gave the big no and that was that .
what a good choice .
a good visit for a one-time trip .
most of the dishes come in a stew form .
service is also quite good .
<UNK> really is superb .
performances are excellent and the facility itself is breathtaking .
i ca n't say enough about this place .
"great drinks , excellent food and outstanding staff ."
terminal t0 is the newest terminal at the airport .

"beyond the food , the service was very good ."
not bad but not good either .
her fries tasted liked cooked in very old oil .
place pretty empty so not sure why .
waiter and manager do n't have answers .

condiment trays were empty .
the soft serve ice cream was liquid .
the pulled pork was dry .
each visit lasted a total of 00-00 minutes .

no brisket which was a disappointment .
their mac & cheese was superb !
"expect to wait a bit , but no worries ."
"awesome service , good food , reasonable prices ."
"the food is n't anything special , satisfying nonetheless ."

really fresh and friendly chefs .
i travel thru las vegas frequently .
i really enjoy the convince of this property .
otherwise for sure a 0 star review .
the room had the most pungent smell of smoke .
"enjoyable dinner , reasonable prices with great food ."
her response killed me .
the game they claimed was not on tv .
what a disappointment this place is .
first it looks dirty and <UNK> .
hogs and hops will compete with the best !

the music does not stop until 0:00 am .
the french fries are awesome .

excellent food and service .
i tried on 0 suits yesterday .
that pretty much sums it up .
"and oh , how wrong they are ."

"' ' ` ` oh , but they will ."
"nothing against borders fans , of course ."

kobe beef makes for a pretty fantastic <UNK> .
the crab cakes were pretty good .
their beer selection is n't fantastic .

five guys burgers are straight up burgers .
- rrb - what grade beef is it ?
what sort of bread is it ?
it ' s a hamburger bun .
"and damn it , it ' s greasy deliciousness ."
fresh cut and fried .
owner or manager was also friendly .
stumbled upon this place on our visit to montreal .
staff provides great customer service .
and the selection of gear and shoes is good .
avoid it like the plague .
it ' s very bad service .
expect a crowded french bistro <UNK> was attentive .
- lrb - 0-0 stars - rrb - .
the edamame was very good as well .
"first off , the food we ate was excellent ."
"excellent restaurant , period ."
"prices were ok , i tried the korean bbq ."

had a great time at the mgm .
the ambience of this place is really cool .

peggy had the <UNK> mussel dinner that was superb .
. no culinary chops needed .
the rib eye and lobster specials were simply superb .
"yet again , the food was amazing ."
what ' s not to like ?
<UNK> is a master at informing and entertaining .
peg and i are delighted by this place .
the burritos are always top notch .
' ' would have been something more palatable .
a single meatball was another course .
what i heard was the sound of ... crickets .
"friendly , and efficient ."
. it deserves a new yelp .
- rrb - and the crew .
tony was our server and did an outstanding job .
they were extraordinarily tasty .
the limited menu is unlimited in taste !

the obvious ... the espresso and cappuccino were wonderful .
what a special place .

sumo maya is one of them .

the seating and service was prompt and courteous .
for a gastropub this place is not bad .
foie gras <UNK> 0 .

great local place for japanese hot pot .
"food fresh , good service ."

prices are fair for what you get .
grilled artichoke appetizer wasnt cooked enough .
the guy <UNK> is a con artist .
look up his records .
he should be in jail not in business .
"server , busser , excellent ."
we order bowls this time instead of burritos .
big bowls ... skimpy portions .
maybe a spoonful of meat .
the staff was n't nearly as nice as before .
"bland , and not very hot ."
a few small shops .
"overall , it ' s an ok transfer point ."
heaven forbid you have a quick connection .
family owned and operated .
this business appears to be family owned .
this individual has zero professionalism managing employees .
try some positive <UNK> for a change .

they just give you salsa free of charge .
others open at 0 .

"these guys are fast , knowledgeable , and professional ."

desert : cheese cake .
the whole place is just a little off .
decent spot for breakfast .
service could be a lot better .
every coffee cup in the whole place is different .

. starters and sides are always good .
with the name comes a little hook .
there is some good and some bad here .

my wife ordered some tacos based on my recommendation .
four peaks is the dominant brewery here in phoenix .
you can tell the owner is a dead head .
really ties into the college vibe .
they dont change it up much .
four peaks makes good beer .
the problem is that they dont make amazing beer .
invest some of that money into an ac system .
"solid biscuits , chorizo , and a well-cooked egg ."
"will be back and again , best steak ever ."
the chips are usually a bit stale .
they run about $ 00-00 ish bucks a bag .

i really want to give this 0 stars .
i went for the hop knot ipa .
they charged me $ 00 which thought was high .

the rooms were fairly up to date .
"wow , what a hidden gem ."
- rrb - and wow on the food .
friendly staff and cool atmosphere other than that .

overpriced and run down .
personnel were not fun or engaging .
this place is that good .
definitely recommend for a good slice in vegas !

"great food , nice atmosphere and great service ."
"other than that , 0 stars ."
these plates could easily hold 0 .
the other soups were tasty as well .
great beer selection with even better staff .
it was like having 0 servers not just one .
"had 0 of everything , mostly brand new ."
tv ' s in the lounge and both bedrooms .
they do an excellent job here .
it is a great place to relax before flying out

when in charlotte always enjoyed sushi at <UNK> location .
lunch special was great value .
this is the best food in las vegas .
casual place with a laid back atmosphere .
best food in vegas .
great food and atmosphere .
the fries were cold .
the drinks and variety of beers is very good .
we found the sports complex to be very nice .
an unbelievable looking and tasting deli sandwich station .
we also had some craft beers which were good .
so 0.0 stars sounds good .
"yeah , the world is n't fair ."
anyway ... the inside looks good .
the view upstairs is pretty cool .
our group always comes here to drink and eat .
one if my favorite korean restaurants here in vegas .
love the bbq ribs and garlic squid !
to go is better than dining in .
fyi my car has manual transmission .
the front of the house staff are like zombies .
' you get a response and a smile .
` what else do you want ?
owners - do something about this .
truly the best restaurant north of shea blvd . .
no wonder the joint was mostly empty .
so many good things about this joint !
you know where i am going ?
"great food , fast and friendly service ."
"really good sandwiches , soups and drinks ."
i hope these guys do well .
some changes to the menu will be required .
"bland , low quality chicken and only $ 00 !"
coupon valid only on day of printing .
this bar / club plays too many games .
great service without the <UNK> .
honest and operate with integrity .
i ' ve used erik for a year now .
excellent job and everything works for way less money .
someone recommended this place and what a great idea !
i got some sort of omelet .
0 bucks for a scoop is pretty bad .
but maybe it ' s just because its vegas .
the entire staff was friendly and very helpful .
the server was friendly and prompt .
"great , job , fast service and reasonable rates ."
new to the area and saw on triple d .
"amenities - - bowling alley , good ."
casino - - nothing special .
the worst service ever .
southwest bikes is that shop .
the real question do have the lowest prices ?
do not sign up here go else where .
another scam is the <UNK> even with charge card .
february is short month .
they never admitted their system was in error .
"worst casino management in henderson , nevada ."
that contributes to high blood pressure .
overall best gym i ever been a member of .
i have tried all in las vegas ie .
"towels , built-in key locks on lockers ."
anything less does n't deserve your business .
i do n't drink alcohol nor smoke .
are they going to treat me better then ?
the casinos are its surroundings ... ghetto .
best computers and best software .
design is how it works .
the impression is this a business to avoid .
do yourself a favor find better deals somewhere else .
extremely racist management and yes they do <UNK> practices .
when reading the sign that says backpacks not allowed .
is like saying <UNK> are not allowed .
i gave them my players card and left .
kroger brand is tough to beat .
that says a lot to me .
prices are also good .
four the locker rooms are way smaller .
this still a world class gym by far .
worst place to play .
this business try to emulate dotty ' s .
worst customer service and most deceptive gaming machines .
good advise and i am leaving .
no question i will come back .
not overpriced : check .
let me give you some perspective .
why a four stars instead of a five ?
but buttered bagel with swiss cheese ?
"man , this was the bomb ."
' ' the food was pretty good .
the curry was very good .
i went on the <UNK> which are ridiculously cool .
these karts are fast .
inside they have tons of games .
this place is in good shape by comparison .
i ' ll be back for sure .
potstickers with 0 sauces are a good pick .
this <UNK> my review .
do not miss steak cilantro !
totally worth the short wait .
i recommend this to anyone who likes mexican food .
inexpensive and would order again .
looked better than it tasted .
been to the one in green valley .
find a new interior designer .
"on the plus side , the <UNK> was good ."
not compelling enough to bring me back .
cafe berlin has authentic german food .
this is a good thing .
a foodie ' s wet dream .
also the atmosphere is <UNK> .
amazing flavor combinations well presented .
scottish salmon was well worth it .
i do n't say that often in this town .
why does the pizza in vegas suck so bad ?
this is a case in point .
the stuff this place turns out is plain nasty .
how he stays in business is beyond me .
major missed opportunity here .
this place is outstanding .
the flavor was surprisingly good .
call it a test .
my wife had a glass of bordeaux .
we opted for three appetizers which were all spectacular .
the steak was a perfect medium rare .
both solid offerings and made in house .
this place has our business from here on out .
it is always outstanding .
that <UNK> my review .
will try this place again .
excellent burger and fries !
tried mod pizza on a whim .
good service and clean place .
"the food is cooked to order , nothing reheated ."
place gets crowded quickly in the late afternoon .
haircuts start at $ 00 .
great new mexico stay food .
great food for the price .
always great service and food .
try the chicken wing to start meal .
small place but big on customer service and quality .
very good customer service .
very hospitable people and educated staff .
at the golden gate .
they speak of the diner .
the diner is the reason why i went here .
the food is good and cheap .
there ' s a reason it ' s cheap .
same goes for this spot .
it is what it is .
you see the weirdest shit .
i moved to las vegas in 0000 .
"yes , i am alive to talk about it ."
one had <UNK> or whatever on .
if you had done drugs heavily ?
so here ' s the deal .
do yourself a favor and go here .
i saw big unit pitch .
way to screw up an otherwise beautiful park .
"anyhow , this stadium is top-notch ."
great value as well !
the dinning area was super clean and maintained .
it ' s a good buffet overall .
"otherwise , pretty good service and helpful ."
a restaurant that serves beer .
"burgers are very good , service not so much ."
atmosphere is classy but business casual .
i have been twice and will return .
:p thanks <UNK> ... awesome business .
tom is are server .
he is so efficient and courteous .
the food is ok .
dont buy from <UNK> .
service was good and fast .
the food was a mixed bag .
i was in town for a business trip .
the first time i went here i was hooked .
it ' s just 000 % awesome .
my last visit had a better fry selection .
visiting this place i was a little skeptical .
i started with the white bean soup .
location is fairly nice being central on the strip .
overall the ambience is great and its very enjoyable .
its one of my hotels of choice .
not a whole lot going on anywhere .
"overall , the place is nice and clean ."
wife raved in her eggs benedict as well .
all was good but pork shoulder was great .
hope you enjoy your visit to island style !
this place blows me away .
accidentally came across this place and just love it .
one of the best services we ever had .
the staff is friendly and pretty prompt .
looking forward to my next visit .
all i can say is wow !
the food is excellent as are the prices .
i ' m excited for these guys .
i highly recommend wayne and certified garage doors .
this place still never disappoints .
the only issue i had were the onions .
eventually another hostess led us to our table .
the dessert is in the <UNK> of the area .
just remember to pronounce this place correctly .
i go to shows here just about every month .
"as for the security , they have a policy ."
not the security team ' s fault .
the bow bar helped me greatly in that endeavor .
flavorless is the only way to describe it .
not one spice could be seen or tasted .
panda express is sadly a step up .
instant potatoes instead of the real think .
the best mexican food .
this place is great .
and the risk of damage .
shakes at this place are amazing .
i ' ve had nearly everything on the menu .
the atmosphere and food are outstanding .
a surprisingly good restaurant considering the <UNK> .
this place is one to avoid .
wow are these some big plates !
my wife had the sage chicken which is huge !
better than any pho place in chinatown !
"best car buying experience , ever ."
could n't have been any better .
they need longer hours .
so convenient and right by the light rail station .
they are supposed to have a trade in policy .
i feel lied to and grossly mislead .
loved the 0 corner pizza with bacon .
"last week was not good , today the same ."
i ' ll give this 0 more chance .
well it was not !
biscuits and gravy was cold and stale .
a simple little place .
did not like the humus .
keep up the good work !
"cool location , building , courtyard ."
this is run of the mill mexican food .
i remembered this place from a few years ago .
other than being microwaved gravy it was ok .
the big star here was the server .
"please try this place , its not horrible ."
sad state that are in .
. gravy was cold but flavor was good .
i like this place .
you can not go wrong here .
just jump right in .
food well worth the visit bit a bit pricey .
waited an hour to get it prepared .
my favorite is the black pepper sizzling beef .
"i don , t know about this place ."
tables dirty floor dirty .
im <UNK> i will try jersey mikes next time .
no one bussing tables .
hard to have a conversation when its packed .
coffee and tea bill came to 00.00 .
"now , worst in the valley ."
keep working to make this better .
had a slow leak in the front tire .
"took it in , they changed the tires ."
tires were not leaking air just the rim .
disappointed in this decision .
manager running around not paying attention to the store .
the humus was horrible .
if it is they are doing it wrong .
i love to get a pizza on tuesdays .
can not go wrong here .
steak was not cooked properly .
only real negative was the side order of toast .
it ' s like eating in a <UNK> .
"great green chili pork , awesome biscuits and gravy ."
i have the biscuits and chipped beef gravy .
food is most of the time is off .
. much better than <UNK> .
i contacted the corp office and never herd back .
the food sucks not .
"food was good , on the small portion size ."
why ca n't they open on time .
been able to get in now .
the service does lack sometimes .
not a fan of this place .
especially the fried chicken .
denny ' s would have been as good .
the fried okra was bland with no seasoning .
the food was hot though .
avoid this at all costs .
never i ' ll go to the mayo clinic .
had a fantastic time here this afternoon .
so i basically paid 00 dollars total .
tried the fried steak and will get it again .
finally got the chance to stop by this weekend .
super service and great food .

the compressor works fine .
their pho is some of the best ive had .

"great service , but a little over friendly ."
water and a beer was brought to the table .
the appetizer ' s were ok .
the firecracker was good .
it ' s a shame .
they took on a large space up front .
"yes , the portions are gigantic ."
the thai tea was decent .
i would recommend you stay away .
nothin but a whole bunch of crap <UNK> around .
a great way to celebrate our wedding anniversary .
mccarran needs a makeover .
seems like these workers makes their own policy .
amazingly good service and could not have been nicer .
thank guys for making our evening great .
see you next time .
- rrb - try the sea bass as well .
very unorganized when it comes to ordering .
forget about the kids chicken strip meal .
good luck hope you can turn this around .
we will be back sooner than later .

someone there does ! ! ! .
refilled water and hot tea / coffee non stop .
they put 0 buckets to catch the water .
excellent meal service and drinks .
the cocktails are top notch .
the lunch deal was great .
sushi loca ' s fish is pretty damn good .
as good as ive had in tokyo .
served with the special care that toro deserves .
very friendly and flexible .
this is definitely the case with <UNK> .
not worth the money anymore .
what more do you need ?
"oh yeah , brew selection ."
"ok , then lets recap ."
based on service only .
food and shakes are very good .
kids meatball and spaghetti 0 used .
food came out ninja fast .
for us with two kids was good .
wait staff seemed to be every man for himself .
others experiences seem to have good service .

"very good coffee , music , and atmosphere ."
freshly roasted single estate coffees expertly prepared !
huge burger with melted cheese and it was fantastic .

i took my nevada ccw course here recently .
0 - rrb - good instruction from mike .
everything about south point is great .
good rates compared to what is on the strip .
i have stayed here a few times .
rooms are very nice .
the best country bar in town .
if you are a local do not come here .
and this is from an experienced shooter .
by far the best bar in vegas .
a butcher and steak house .
they park my car at 00 miles an hour .
good healthy steak is the theme .
. along with the <UNK> head !
thai cuisine is healthy <UNK> doubt about it .
but only in the hands of the good chefs .
but it is cheap which explains the <UNK> .
some chefs have the touch and other do n't .
the secret to good indian food is authentic cooks .
. this was the old days .
they need good entertainment to draw the gringos .
but he ca n't fool the real foodies .
this is the best japanese eatery in vegas .
this was not a class but a italian feast .
and pineapple is not one of them .
with slices of pizza for the <UNK> .
. sure thing ben !
<UNK> by one minus rating .
we looked like two hairy <UNK> ' s !
it was neatly presented .
. especially between the manager and his favorites .
both of our mac and cheese sides were cold .
the food is marginal most of the time .
i had the chicken fried steak .
easy to miss and drive right by .
beats <UNK> ' s and <UNK> inn for sure !
basic mexican food you can find on any corner .
do n't go expecting more .
yet another corporate crap restaurant comes to scottsdale .
welcome to new american dining .
what a let down .
but the <UNK> is n't terribly comfortable or attractive .
"a very , very average restaurant ."
"imo , true foods does a much better job ."
and the wait staff was attentive and polite .
"very , very average ."
the only thing really worthwhile is the sushi bar .
"extremely well done , and well worth the admission ."
but it is n't something you will rave about .
the nicest overall experience in the area .
i must shed a tear and move on .
our try your hand - lrb - foot ?
chili was quite good and filling .
the sauce is amazing .
"there ' s nothing else to say , really ."
go here for good pizza .
how low the mighty have fallen .
do n't waste your time .
. machine ? ? ? <UNK> posh .
i can handle my menus hand painted on <UNK> .
"the whole bar <UNK> , which my girlfriend loved ."
spaghetti and meatballs were tasty .
the hamburgers were really good .
"for the price though , i was very satisfied ."
first impression walking in was very positive .
so we proceeded with ordering .
i got the hamburger with french fries .
the hamburger was very good .
no doubt about that .
"bottom line : good food , but way overpriced ."
my favorite diner when i com to las vegas .
only 00 minutes of drive from the strip .
strongly recommended for a hang over .
it was very affordable and amazingly quick .
simple breakfast with ` ` miami ' ' decor .
came here on christmas day with my family .
"wrong again , fruit were very limited ."
i concluded my experience on this trip .
they will serve you second grade food .
"quick , efficient , and friendly ."
not enough personnel to support the customer .
appointments do n't mean nothing here .
they left a really bad impression .
really nice looking place - modern / industrial look .
the food came out quick and it was excellent .
the breading was nice and thick and tasted amazing .
oh & the coffee was excellent as well .
had a good time and was very tasty .
' ' no need to call anyone else .
but ... internet access is simply horrible .
a 00 dollar burrito filled with very chewy steak ?
"nah , i ' m not coming back ."
i had the dinner buffet on a wednesday night .
the curry does n't have any taste .
i ' ll not pay full price for this .
"pizza comes thin , but not completely crunchy ."
i ' ll be back .
because it has a nice little menu .
"with that said , the crowd is generally older ."
this is old-fashioned breakfast cooking .
"alright , first off i ' m an idiot ."
so here ' s the final verdict .
i ' ll be back .
the concession stand seemed to be cheaper as well .
cant get much better for a dollar theater imho .
how can you dislike jack ?
"it really hits the spot , every time ."
this time trying the calzone .
i had my left <UNK> replaced on <UNK> .
"again , nice to see ."
"all-in-all , a great place ."
oh yeah ... this place is a bar .
nobody has taken me up on that offer .
i ' m now thirsty .
"c'mon peeps , judge it for what it is ."
i come here every thursday to bowl with friends .
the lanes are nice .
i can not stand this .
will stop by again .
a small oasis in the center of the city .
so nothing here has changed .
the four stars on this place remains !
what do you get in an outdoor <UNK> ?
"well , the heat for starters ."
"and for seconds , bad acoustics ."
"wtf , $ 00 for a 00oz can ?"
i do n't like to sit in a seat .
also expect to have no cell service .
"you will get it , but it is low ."
i stopped by on the chinese new years .
i really wish i remembered what they called it .
i like this place .
"first , separate yourself from the group ."
their quoted price was way more than other places .
"ha , nacho ' s nachos ... or nachos ."
<UNK> is in a weird place .
it was damn good .
place was spacious and felt very down to earth .
"slightly off topic , but my server was <UNK> ."
the seared part was absolutely <UNK> .
holy crap this was good .
i went there quite often during the march madness .
and you know the worst part ?
this is n't the playboy mansion you weirdos .
what ... no <UNK> gin ?
what the hell kind of bar are you ?
your mileage may vary on that last one .
this is a dive bar .
you will be <UNK> and <UNK> .
drink specials are the bomb .
"secondly , he prescribed my cat <UNK> ."
so much for being a loyalty member .
i liked this place a lot .
they make both of them in house as well .
i just was n't 000 % .
i got charged for everything at their inflated prices .
"and occasionally , <UNK> !"
sit with whoever you want .
both good in my opinion .
so i am lost of what to say .
"for this , i give them low <UNK> ."
tired of the horse cops on mill ave ?
want something close to the light rail ?
"well , bar smith might be your place ."
so what did my friend think about the place ?
what else is bad ?
so what is good ?
"maybe not battle , but show their latest moves ."
so what is the verdict here ?
"<UNK> , there goes that 0 - star review ."
my experience on <UNK> was terrible .
so what did i experience here last week ?
"for starters , there were three lines ."
most places have two - general and vip .
our grease price was n't high enough .
the place is a swamp both figuratively and literally .
"first off , line for the dudes ."
the dance floor is an absolute joke .
and not only that ... no coors or budweiser .
where the hell am i ?
moral of the story - get it repaired correctly .
"hours : monday - saturday , 00:00 -00:00 ."
i ' d call it fixed .
update 00/00 / 0000 : xbox 000 repaired again .
update 00/00 / 0000 : emailed andrew .
update 0/00 / 0000 : the xbox 000 died .
i received no response .
i will list the reasons why .
- lrb - 0 - rrb - prices .
- lrb - 0 - rrb - <UNK> hell .
- lrb - 0 - rrb - trip hazard .
i also like the bowling pro shop here .
mixed results on all this for my <UNK> <UNK> .
i injured my <UNK> in 0000 .
it is my pleasure to submit this review .
my experience here is being compared to performance bike .
i am far from a <UNK> .
i took the girlfriend here to try something new .
"with that said , the gf liked it ."
"again , not bad but just not my style ."
the gf loved her salad .
"real sleek , <UNK> bar ."
the kitchen is open .
we finished the bottle off without issue .
as for service and atmosphere it was pretty decent .
everyone dining there seemed laid back .
big massive country bar / restaurant in the hills .
"this should go without saying , but bring water ."
you can still drive out after dark though .
this one is bigger than the average store .
"cool , all the better ."
so <UNK> is a 00 minute drive without traffic .
you know what this means ?
it means it is good .
it means that i like it .
"to me , that seems like <UNK> <UNK> ."
do i order here or there ?
good lord this place is confusing .
the owner however was super nice .
"actually , absurdly nice ."
it was nice for us two <UNK> folks .
"with all this said , would i go again ?"
nice hd tvs of the game everywhere .
"again , no apologies ."
so what is the conclusion on all this ?
"came on saturday @user 00:00 pm , nobody here ."
"service was nice , quick , and easy ."
in april 0000 i tore my <UNK> .
oil pan gasket was replaced and no longer leaks .
and the electrical problem was fixed .
they do offer a discount for making a review .
<UNK> food is pretty good .
the other ones have been so-so .
i was the first person to be picked up .
what is the downfall of the place ?
"for me , that they close at 0p m ."
the crowd is generally pretty good .
i came in about 00mins before closing .
- rrb - the food was pretty good .
good food and service .
so leave your pretty scottsdale attire at home .
drink prices were higher than <UNK> prices .
the atmosphere was pretty cool there .
could be a rather interesting time around 0am !
"good sales , good delivery ."
cadillac ranch seems like the scottsdale away from scottsdale .
perfect place in chandler to go and get plastered .
food is actually pretty good .
always friendly to this <UNK> redneck .
not sure what else i could ask for .
this place failed on both of those fronts .
the atmosphere is pretty cool .
"in any case , the bad ?"
this is a review for bb ' s nightlife .
met some cool people back there too .
"on my corner , i have <UNK> and kokomo ."
what is there to not like about this place ?
0 - stars simply because they are expensive .
pump in some quarters and wash away !
the crowd was far from my prior douchebag experiences .
the main bar seemed pretty efficient .
so they seemed pretty diverse .
so why the $ 0 star ?
this place was good .
this line had nobody in it .
i got the moist brisket and some other stuff .
not a big deal .
he seemed very straight forward and honest .
get out your yelp smartphone app ... and check-in .
the food is n't bad .
"you sir , are <UNK> ."
what is there to say about the home depot ?
the competition is generally lowes .
"however , who cares ."
thanks tom and anita !
but make a trip here a lunch run .
i ' m totally cool with this .
prices are good on some things .
tip 0 : hungry ?
it generally is the lowest in the area .
why not pre-game before getting raped at another bar ?
while in there i thought it was pretty cool .
"no expectations , maybe you could say ."
"now , my friend is a tough food critic ."
some of the chips were not bad .
"bld responded , in a way , <UNK> ."
they seemed kind of personally offended .
"as in , the dance floor is too bright ."
price of pizza was slightly above average .
they also served far less rice than rama .
all of them in my opinion were great singers .
no hungry people at my show .
there are all sorts of sub places .
"for hot subs , i prefer firehouse by far ."
i really love most of their subs .
are you really needing your food in 0 seconds ?
the steaks are really good there .
the price is n't too <UNK> there either .
food is great as is service .
first and foremost i am not a pho master .
"guess what , my room also smelled like smoke ."
room did cool down eventually .
i ' ll be brief .
this is an ohio state buckeye <UNK> bar .
in general their food is pretty good .
upgraded speakers as of last wednesday .
"with that said , thanks for the tvs ."
"drinks are pretty good seriously , over 0000 reviews ?"
"with that said , the pizza was good ."
it had a fresh feel to it .
kind of like it was homemade on the spot .
guess being popular is a good problem !
"chandler <UNK> central , <UNK> mall ."
always clean with scenery .
if it wo n't close then it will drip .
could i have done it myself ?
their selection is phenomenal .
i was that guy .
so what is the good ?
the place is country enough .
people wearing boots and daisy duke shorts .
airport is generally clean as well .
i ' d say the location is bad .
i ' ve eaten sushi all over the place .
- rrb - and taste great .
so what is the bad ?
it helps you and it helps them .
"ah , <UNK> <UNK> ."
"bottom line , would i go back ?"
april gives the place a 0/0 .
i give it a 0-0 . 0 / 0 .
"in my experience , the times are fairly accurate ."
this is n't jimmy johns serving you a sub .
"sonic , eating with you is a <UNK> ."
the food was good and the prices were fair .
"<UNK> , however , is a staple ."
the place is fun though .
"in all , i liked the place ."
i hate that place .
get your haircut old school style .
much better than any cut and <UNK> place .
this place is nice .
even i knew this .
so about this place .
the staff is new .
time may improve their service .
"i got my staple , chicken alfredo ."
what was my impression ?
one was a a / v receiver .
"heavy , bulky , and electronic ."
plenty good to return another time .
in quiet chandler there is n't many options .
this is a pretty good place .
got some cheap dish cleaning utensils .
is this place super styling ?
a <UNK> representative came by my house on <UNK> .
"wtf , are you serious ?"
i will give it a 0/0 .
what was magnificent with this place was the service .
"first , do n't eat 0 hours before arriving ."
i ' ll be back .
the taters were good as was the steak .
i ' d call that a win .
check out the bbb method and save some money .
this sold me on <UNK> almost alone .
are they the cheapest ?
ps - the women there were attractive .
i had a ball here .
i ' ve gone here for a few years .
staff is generally nice and quick at the bar .
they are little greasy nuggets of joy .
"but dang , they are awesome ."
this is a new one .
always friendly and fast service .
the place has old pinball machines and arcade games !
holy hell this is freaking badass !
they have veterans discounts every day .
i got the chili hamburger .
the place was clean and easy to understand .
why do people hate jack so much .
my girlfriend and her family rave about this place .
phoenix is a huge sprawling city .
the train always seems clean to me .
ask for bartender mike .
it really is n't my thing in either case .
this target is no exception .
what is there to not like ?
"overall , it ' s good ."
"and better yet , it tastes phenominal ."
oddly enough can you guess what i brought in ?
it is that good .
the price was $ 00 .
"however , in normal light it is fine ."
the place is good .
"this place is n't gourmet , but who cares ."
they even denied the claim for <UNK> anal glands .
i do n't care for that vibe .
the place seems clean and fairly lively .
the buffet is a good meal .
"come hungry , the buffet is huge ."
you are the dive bar in scottsdale .
nobody will notice how old i am anyways !
it is what it is .
it ' s basically a <UNK> .
but the vibe is good .
live band on the weekends and strong drinks .
the wings are great and the food is solid .
but it is a good time .
minors customer service is outstanding .
they were a bit understaffed that night .
and the burger i ordered was outstanding !
lazy lack of attention to detail .
they did a very poor job cleaning the inside .
i had the prime beef tenderloin .
i highly recommend the philly roll .
i had the <UNK> soup .
"now , the good stuff ."
the food was very good .
the others in my party also enjoyed their food .
wonderful martial arts school .
i called member solutions to reduce the payments .
there are only three methods to cancel .
next time sticking to room service .
reasonable prices for a lot of food .
"it ' s a little loud , though ."
casual sports bar to hang out at .
awesome view from top .
you should go here once .
the owner / manager was friendly and professional .
the bar looked great from a distance .
we had the pulled pork sandwich and a burger .
"excellent food , friendly staff ."
food is upscale without pretense .
efficient and friendly staff .

do n't waste your time - go somewhere else .
very similar to the beverly hills one .
"room : old , dirty , used up ."
the spinach soup with lentils was superb .
the food : steaks are great here .
the fillet was exactly as described .
seafood : daily flown in from around the world .
` ` farmed here in las vegas .
` ` everything in las vegas is wild .
"no doubt , <UNK> does a great pasta ."
"as other yelpers noted , service is exemplary !"
"anyway , jim told the history of the company ."
value : steaks and seafood entrees run <UNK> .
a local recommended the flame .
the sides were just average .
these crabs have a thick shell .
the standard omelet is made with 0 eggs !
so my wife and i split a plate .
"salmon belly , for example , is a treat ."
this place is <UNK> .
the bathroom door does not close properly .
the steaks are top notch and cooked to perfection .
the food was overall good .
lots of different meats soups and dishes .
overall worth going to .
the food lives up to the reputation !
definitely worth going to .
excellent view of the strip from upstairs .
so why only three stars ?
i tried 0 types of pizza and their meatballs .
the meatballs were average .
a nice unique option when you need something quick .
it ' s not their fault .
the service was pretty good as well .
i will visit this spot again before i leave .
"not bad , but not great either ."
nice lady running establishment .
love the bbq and everything else .
they where not offered assistance in any form .
"problem 0 , risk management ."
nevertheless the fried rice and the pork were good .
very good food and even better service .
"this place is really great , love the concept ."
this is a pizza chipotle .
didnt see that coming .
very friendly staff and good quality ingredients .
under staffed during lunch .
simply put ... poorly managed
waited over an hour for the food .
everyone was apologetic saying the kitchen got slammed .
do n't go here at an odd time .
superb flavors whichever way you go .
prices are low for what they serve you .
i highly recommend braddah ' s .
nice buffet for the price .
a sure bet here in vegas .
you will not be disappointed .
it was hard as a rock .
the bbq pork was almost the texture of jerky .
highest recommendation for this business .
best thing i ' ve done for my sprinklers .
wife and i had lunch here today .
we were real pleased .
the delivery men were top notch .
i mean these guys are super .
this is the place to buy your bedding .
now on to the fare served here .
the consensus was that each was excellent .
five star times four equals twenty stars .

you earned our future business .
they ' ve got em .
"fun people , great food , nice environment ."
what more do you need ?
coming from chicago this is a pretty steep price .

warm and welcoming staff .
kinda 00 ' s malt shop .
this place is a keeper .
places like this are far and few between .
skip their other location on the strip .
the sauce is what makes this pizza .
i always find something sassy when i visit .
especially if that store is walmart .
the italian sodas are also good .
i would call this place fast-casual .
"long wait , good food , good beer ."
"nice atmosphere , bit over priced ."
great food and service .
overall quite heavy but very good .
it was very good .
the service was below average to average .

"no complaints , a-ok ."
the bad is the service / overall friendliness .
i ' ll be generous and give 0 * .
a huge portion at a reasonable price .

good values and less common finds in the us .
went to the emergency room here .
"the fish was terrible , definitely not a recommend ."

just food shoved into a tortilla best meal .
"great chicken , great veggies ."
really enjoyed the food .
and stop using microwave food .

alley cat worked well .
the highlight of my night was the bartender .
also served was some awesome <UNK> ` <UNK> bread .
turned out to be a delicious choice .
the shrooms were perfect and the asparagus were good .
seems like your standard carryout chinese place .
that ca n't be a good fortune .

what you see is what you get .
well worth the cost .
both were quite tasty .
mac ' s is an appealing place to eat .
mac and cheese was good .
the service was good baby .
good tv set up .
the mustard was pretty good also .
still a great place with a cool vibe .

mini golf courses need walls .
"however , i do recommend the driving range ."
we went with the club and the meatloaf sandwich .
the sam adams draft was $ 0 plus tip .
it is n't as upscale as i thought .
we also tried a tasty burger with steak fries .
seems to be something on special most days .
the bar looks nice and inviting .

the legend is true .

"why it ' s there , nobody knows ."
it just has such a unique feel .

nice selection of beer .
huge patio with several corn hole boards set up .

you can substitute other sides for the french fries .
i went with the veggies which were good .
wife is currently in love with the carrot cake .
this place was amazing .
lobster and crab were cooked absolutely perfectly .
the guys were pros .
the absolute worst car buying <UNK> .
is this place closed ?

this is a great shop .
the selection of new <UNK> is impeccably curated .
the used section was also impressive .
great friendly staff and very clean place !
great place for breakfast .

the flavor is in the meat not the sauce .
the jack daniels burger was great .
the fries are way better than mcdonalds .
very easy to make a cheap game here .
the gyro deluxe is amazing .
this place was bomb .
what the heck it was like 0 bucks .

it makes coming to a game affordable .
i will not continue to support this trend .
including that guard this place place is bomb .
but the price is what is really great .
service was tentative and extremely polite .
a failure on both counts .
service is attentive and good .
"it comes with the territory fellas , stop whining ."
viva mexican food in vegas ?
decent food and good service for the price .
nice remodeled rooms and bathroom sundries .
my server did not speak english .
dirt cheap <UNK> pricing .
- rrb - holding it down for eastside lv .
great little spot and worthy of multiple repeat performances .
blood stains on wall .
asian guys giving me hard looks .
pool access is included either way .
this place is starting to show its age though .
something is definitely amiss here .
as for the establishment itself .
the sandwiches are huge and priced right .
stay away from this place .
pacific auto was fantastic .
short & sweet rental in las vegas .
certainly worth a stop when you are in town .
he was by himself .

the seasoned home fries were also good .
the pork is extremely tender .
the french toast is fantastic .

ribs are tough which is unfortunate .
inside the food was great and staff was welcoming .
easy to get to location .
cooked fine at rare .
service was very good and attentive overall .
their ' s were much better .
"overall , slightly above average food ."
should be no broth in this dish .
"if you concentrate , you could taste some pork ."
the only thing noteworthy is their service .
the food itself was solid .
"not outstanding , but certainly above average ."
the distribution of meat was quite inconsistent though .
my entree did not show up .
i would recommend against going there .
the downtown location may be better .
paying for internet did kind of suck .
sandwich and slaw shoved into there .
it is an acquired taste .
really pleased with this place .
that ' s exactly why i went .
to learn and to experience .
"pleasant , but not up to speed at times ."
the bathroom is exquisite .
and a most excellent <UNK> bathtub .
the property itself is magnificent .
this place is absolutely amazing .
there was a pride in communicating about their heritage .
the mushrooms were magical .
the property is pristine .
you ' ll be able to find alone time .
the rooms are a fantastic escape as well .
and as for food ?
there are multiple options .
your first priority there should n't be the food .
comfortable inside without a bad seat in the house .
"higher up , great views of the surrounding area ."
get your credit card ready .
"fresh , simple , and <UNK> ."
the side of <UNK> lobster sealed the deal .
but better than both .
this place is operated by <UNK> <UNK> nation .
it was recently named a james beard american classic .
the red chili stew was <UNK> good .
does this place have a sense of humor ?
i was sold on fried prosciutto .
bet you have n't had this before .
duck <UNK> with molasses foam .
"of course , a molasses foam ."
puff with bacon and bacon powder .
are you exhausted yet ?
we ' re not even halfway though the meal .
each bite was somehow familiar and exotic .
orange soda palate cleanser .
a <UNK> cappuccino to celebrate surviving this over-the-top experience .
i had the double double .
"i ' m a fan , no doubt ."
one thing i do n't remember is the cost .
heinz field is right there .
a few blocks from the andy warhol museum .
a few blocks from the 0th street bridge .
the place is modest .
the staff works hard .
"so yeah , prepare to wait ."
the margherita pizza is the <UNK> test for me .
that makes a huge difference .
these are not large pies .
' ' i made the pilgrimage .
i ' m born and raised in ny .
i ' m a <UNK> fan .
i used to live 0 blocks from <UNK> park .
i used to live 0 blocks from wrigley field .
pnc park is currently my favorite mlb ballpark .
the location is incredible .
right on the river .
i asked them who often won .
i miss the religious who worked the store .
one of the best indian restaurants in the valley .
definitely one of the best stores in the valley .
"physically , the place is bland ."
"but overall , it <UNK> the usual chains ."
pizza : great toppings and quality .
the sauce is fantastic .
it ' s a pretty standard crust .
a very nice guy it seems .
the flour tortilla was thick and light and delicious .
great looking place and friendly staff .
"nice place , good food , good beer selection ."
this place has a lot going for it .
we tried the greek salad which was awesome .
asked for diet coke and she brought regular coke .
not the case at this flemings .
really engaging person and spot on knowledge .
"also , they have plain coffee and flavored ones ."
"lasagne was a nightmare , steer clear of it ."
"instead it was tough , and horrible ."
my review of this restaurant below still stands .
i have usually had very good food here .
a shame too because this place has potential .
next i had tacos carbon .
very tasty and well prepared .
"all in all , a solid visit ."
the food was just perfect and as advertised .
received mostly well done piece of bicycle tire .
the place is always clean and busy .
the chocolate chip cookie is a nice touch too .
first time dining here tonight .
"in addition , i prefer the <UNK> pan style ."
for starters - pick a theme and be that .
are you trying to be a sports bar ?
action bar with games ?
the potatoes arrived ice cold !
our taste buds may never recover !
you can tell these guys like what they do .
a world class establishment all the way around !
wings - not enough wing sauce .
beer - first beer came out promptly and cold !
so not a great start for me .
"when my fish arrived , it looked very good ."
highlight of the trio was the <UNK> slaw .
so 0 out of 0 was good .
the reason for 0 stars ?
quality shines through each and every time i go .
wife had the kobe burger .
way better than the boxed frozen variety .
"other than that , the food was mostly awesome ."
best prime in town in my humble opinion .
"yes , it certainly was your fault ."
congrats dave & busted !
the place always looks clean however .
far fewer stars for the experience .
the salsa in my opinion was a home run .
i ate them and it filled my stomach .
' ' this was not the case .
i was blown away .
the short rib really stood out !
the service was also very good .
absolutely perfect in every respect .
fine dining at it ' s best .
parking is a joke .
the wifi was a joke .
terrible signal that dropped repeatedly .
almost $ 00 for bacon and eggs .
their signature roll was lame .
the top of the line toro oh is incredible .
all for only 0 dollars .
"and , they are very friendly and professional ."
none of us had ever eaten there before .
the deco is western mixed with southern hippy .
the food took a long time to come out .
let me tell you about my experience .
the food was great .
very nice people and quick service .
"alas , i digress ."
"good food , good service ."
this is somewhat new to the business .
"no harm , no foul ."
this is a good location for a car wash .
the one negative part about the location is traffic .
it can be brutal during peak times .
"once parking happened , we went inside ."
i will be having those again .
- the bathrooms are always clean and fully stocked .
this is the happening place to be in charlotte .
we enjoyed some very delicious wine and cocktails .
the service at this location is outstanding .
the <UNK> is high quality and very clear !
great new addition to the charlotte uptown area .
that makes tipping crappy service even more awkward .
need some clothes tailored ?
this is a welcomed addition to the elizabeth area .
that is the best value for your dollar .
food was incredibly good .
beverages are in bottles or cans .
service was friendly and it seemed busy .
busy for good reason .
the apple pie desert was <UNK> .
aloha to all the staff at vegas valley motors .
hands down the best place in town .
the pizza at il <UNK> was fantastic .
the ambiance was very nice as well .
new to area and know good chinese food .
the rice tasted great !
crab wontons were great .
wifes entree was very good also .
glad i finally found some good chinese food .
sushi portions small and not fresh .
some food undercooked and some overdone .
outback steakhouse is much much better .
we decided to stop by at this place .
the breakfast styled burger was epic .
the customer service was top notch .
took good care of us and was very informative .
definitely over priced for the quality of the food .
. dirty dishes and knives to begin with .
if your cooks ca n't cook steaks .
. please consider a new profession .
". spacious , clean & relaxing vapor boutique ."
friendly knowledgeable staff on the floor .
i really like the place .
. it ' s worth checking out .
i went there twice and loved it both times .
dim lights - lrb - sucker for ' em !
the rock was standing guard at the entrance .
. i ' m a only a man .
suit yourself - your loss because i loved it !
anything else would n't have been good enough !
you can get one of them there as well .
i highly recommend it and kudos to yelp !
ridiculously overpriced and ridiculously diluted with other crap .
you must check this place out .
we ' ll be back soon .
it still had crumbs in it .
i will be finding a new car wash .
not the best but not bad at all .
however the service was lackluster at best .
all of the food came out a different times .
and for the price go to nobu .
kinda disappointing for the price .
the experience was nonexistent .
if you ' re a whiskey man / woman .
"hummus was thin , but tasty ."
some of the best vegan i ' ve had .
"very marginal food , service , and atmosphere ."
"respectful , courteous and plain spoken ."
they give unlimited chips and their own unique salsa .
we leave having eaten nothing .
"the real question is , why ?"
"to be more specific , human <UNK> ."
do not eat here .
"anyway , back to the beer ."
prices were surprisingly reasonable as well .
another highlight here was the service .
both were excellent desserts at only $ 0.00 apiece .
sounded interesting and it was actually pretty decent .
the original spot is located across the river downtown .
' ' two 0/0 patties ?
i envy the duke here .
hopefully they ' ll fix that this season .
this place is pretty cool .
sam adams must be considered ` fancy ' here .
- plenty of tvs all over the place .
screw the white wood bar .
` ` it ' s dollar drafts until midnight .
short visit for this straight-up dive .
do you like craft beer ?
multiple shelf lined <UNK> make that decision rather difficult .
want some fresh air instead ?
grab a table at the outdoor seating area .
what to eat for dinner ?
my mistake for not reading the description closely .
glad i stopped by .
prices were about what you ' d expect .
"although different , it was actually very good ."
"yeah , me neither ."
- rrb - around 0:00 pm .
do n't want to worry about parking ?
- convenient parking garage right across the street .
cheap rates on the weekend .
- a couple of good restaurants on site .
a great find in the city .
"also , has its own bar and restaurant ."
a chocolate cinnamon swirl latte to be exact .
"bar review , no food ."
"thank you very much , sir !"
i will be back again and again .
i am a big fan of this place now .
prices were very fair .
awesome dogs that greet every visitor .
they ' re doing nothing but losing money .
never a dull moment and never an empty drink .
one of my favorite burger joints in the valley .
one of my favorite local eateries in town .
"0 dollar bowling , cool , whatever ."
the vig never disappoints .
definitely the best in town .
"reasonably priced , attention to detail ."
"gorgeous views , laid back , and fun ."
stick to local places where they still care .
definitely going to give it a second try .
. <UNK> recommended this hotel .
the sandwiches are in a tasty bread shell .
ordered the 00 dollar steak and eggs .
casino casino : really <UNK> .
casino is a cluster <UNK> .
ice cream sandwich : the brownie was really rich .
smallest bottle of <UNK> was like 00 bucks !
"cheap drinks , and cheap gambling on the strip ."
"line was pretty long , 00-0 hr wait ."
the food was mainly good .
i ordered a burger that has kobe beef .
got food poisoning after eating at this location .
ca n't go wrong in this establishment .
the smoked meat comes in three degrees of fattiness .
"convenient to mcgill , on the eastern side ."
overpriced ; poor ingredients ; americanized thai food .
had the sicilian style and just a regular pepperoni .
best gelato in vegas .
cool little spot in the new summerlin downtown mall .
the pizza is really good compared to most places .
settebello was interesting and good .
the hamburger one was not good in my opinion .
this place is amazing .
they make and cook it the authentic italian way .
the crust and dough is amazing .
cool ambiance and setup inside of the restaurant .
cool seating and tables .
pretty good pizza all around .
wow what a dish .
they have great wine dinners and happy hour specials .
buy 0 yogurts - lrb - of 0 oz .
veggie / meat ratio = just right .
you need the greens to help regulate the <UNK> .
the two main characteristics ?
"it ' s here , folks !"
the rest was up for discount .
i highly recommend this appetizer .
i got a <UNK> chicken burger .
"- rrb - , and banana ketchup ."
no minced green onion as garnish .
the peppercorn rub was definitely memorable and aromatic .
this was only 0 dollar extra .
the 00 cent junior bacon cheeseburger .
first round must be finished before second round .
"closer , cheaper , and tastier ."
mexico city does not do mexican food justice .
- price is currently the same as razzy fresh .
"they gave me a 00 % discount , however ."
too bad it started working before we left .
the environment can most certainly be described as distinctive .
i was seeking the same experience here in pittsburgh .
"however , stay away from the salsa fresca appetizer ."
priced at 0 - lrb - or 0 ?
yelp reviews can sometimes be deceiving .
this was probably one of the prime examples .
california burritos and other burritos are packed with meat .
a couple of points : 0 .
"once again , it lacked all flavor ."
i threw on some ketchup to save the sandwich .
the advertisement claims they use fresh cracked eggs .
moving parts on a disposable plastic cap .
all of their homes were in brand new condition .
nice store good location .
"price is ok , and definitely recommended ."
great store have all the food and water needed .
"somewhat good selections of meat , and seafood ."
came here to have diner and service was outstanding .
<UNK> of the plane is really bad .
restroom needed some touched up .
they do it right here .
in pittsburgh to visit duquesne and pitt .
the new renovations are great for the family .
i ' ve never understood this .
"first visit , this place seems great ."
but it sounded good .
waste of $ 0 .
just as good as eating in the restaurant .
cox cable is a completely incompetent company .
everything about it was great .
i was in a state of awe .
0 stars no doubt .
this looks like some kind of theater ' ' .
they were playing modern pop music .
that ' s too long for a sports bar .
saturated in brown sugar rich sauce .
the atmosphere is very homie .
i would frequent this place .
"all in all , it was a great experience ."
the way a burger should be .
some of the best waffles i have ever had .
and 0 transactions per bill is bullshit !
<UNK> would have hook it up .
the atmosphere is great for close conversation .
"seriously try noodlehead , you wont regret it ."
the high notes of <UNK> did not stop there .
quality food and atmosphere .
this is a great place to take a date .
the staff was friendly and service was excellent .
"thanks for the cold , expensive food ."
i have for years .
"rooms good , staff great ."
as always the teriyaki chicken bowl was fantastic !
we ordered the infused vodka with blackberry and lychee .
i like the new terminal 0 .
i ' d say close to an hour .
the service here was slow .
good spot to have a great time .
the steak is nicely seasoned and pretty tender .
"also , being a smoker , this is heaven ."
even my over easy was pretty much over hard .
there is nothing really special about this place .
maybe with the new ownership things will improve .
great place to get a sandwich .
i was starving by the time it arrived .
the gravy was pretty bad .
the cole slaw was soggy and lacked any flavor .
the mashed potatoes tasted bland .
"again , the gravy was bad ."
second time back at this wonderful indian restaurant .
the decor and setting was tasteful and <UNK> .
the hotel and casino staff are great .
"great waffles , buttery & fluffy ."
but this place is always good .
not to mention parking was slim and none .
low key hangout kinda place .
"great food , great atmosphere ."
i went here first night after it opened .
sangria ' s are very good .
. and i dont usually like ' em !
"they were well done , and intense ."
the 00 oz ribeye steak deal was the best !
that steak almost brought us to tears .
"also , the channel selection is way below average ."
it overlooks the rehab pool during the day .
my hangover cure in vegas .
"much more ` economical ' gambling , as well ."
an average fast food chain .
"polite , and , quick ."
recommended for a <UNK> range hotel in mtl .
<UNK> ' s is cafeteria style in nyny casino .
the pastrami sandwich i got was average .
this place is a party ! ! amazing scene .
seems like a mtl institution .
thanks for the memories <UNK> .
huge ` wow factor ' when you walk in .
really good food and a really friendly staff .
very flavorful and savory .
plenty of choices to choose from .
nice flat screen tvs on each other .
but they earned / deserved it from our party .
the sushi was american and barely even had fish .
dim sum is a do n't try .
their customer service techs are always friendly and professional .
food and staff are good .
the place is nothing special .
the service was helpful and the food was tasty .
be sure to make reservations .
the food is very good .
i gave 0 stars due to price .
the food is good .
it ' s in dire need of renovation .
even then the service can be poor .
this place is completely insane .
the food was bland and mediocre .
they do great work and are very reliable .
always a fair price and always professional and courteous .
my favorite mexican food restaurant period .
"great food , great prices ."
excellent food and great service .
so surprised for an airport terminal location .
that is until i ate at steak 00 .
would definitely recommend to anyone in the area .
atmosphere is great and the food is awesome .
not worth the extra dollars .
just a great experience all around .
the service has always been excellent .
never any problems with the food .
"<UNK> , the service is terrible here ."
this led to much confusion and <UNK> .
the chowder entree was bland .
it was served in a bowl that had <UNK> .
i ordered the halibut fish and chips .
the decor can best be described as <UNK> .
service was very poor .
cool staff : always friendly and cracking up jokes .
bottom line they have great pizza for decent price .
driver was there exactly at the agreed upon time .
i saw the clouds parting and sunshine came through .
they are horrible and have done absolutely nothing .
they are horrible and have done absolutely nothing .
the vegan pizza was definitely subpar in my book .
"superb , no way around that ."
i just moved back down to phoenix from seattle .
that long for a fish fry in wisconsin ?
the head on the beer was ridiculous .
there are two of these places .
they <UNK> it with melted butter .
the rooms were very comfortable .
what a fun place .
i had the calamari app and the hanger steak .
right up there with clowns and <UNK> .
i now have a smile i am proud of !
the man needs a cape !
for the parents the food is excellent !
. very nice for the money .
these were not like nice hipsters either .
they were the stereotypical of uppity <UNK> hipsters .
"first , the place seems super clean ."
also the great beer selection is reasonably priced .
<UNK> is the furthest thing from <UNK> .
they kick it old school french with modern twists .
"sublime , breads , cookies & pastries ."
"very fresh ingredients , creative choices and amazing service ."
we ate at the bar and had indifferent service .
never a bad time .
tanya is perhaps the top mixologist in las vegas .
i . a . c . is also immaculate .
sit in the bar and take it all in .
the other stuff is good but not great .
"again , the beef here is sublime ."
definitely one of the finest properties in las vegas .
the building and facilities are immaculate .
"one more thing , service is professional and attentive ."
i could not recommend <UNK> maids more highly !
the value they provide is absolutely worth the money .
the carne asada beef was made really well .
- the original : very flavorful and savory .
i tacked on a beet salad which was good .
this food court is actually inside the casino royale .
i guess that ' s what happens in vegas .
"however , the burgers made up for the wait ."
i really enjoy the flannel style of hash .
omelet bar is good .
so the one star is basically for the food .
same with some of my friends .
enjoyed the level of <UNK> that the crust was .
- rrb - outside on the deck .
would be good to eat with bread or something .
the sauerkraut is a nice touch .
no signs or warning that they would be closed .
' ' went for a late lunch .
the fish tacos were good also .
i have been to this place twice .
elite spent hours detailing the exterior of our camper .
go to new york .
you want the best new york pizza in arizona ?
no one is here .

dinner was good not great .
the food was good but really small portions .
the buffalo chicken sub was picked by a friend .

not only did the partial refund show up .
it had an alignment issue .
he had good news and bad new for me .

meatballs were different and tasty .
mine was perfectly done .
my wife ' s not so much .
it was under done and very tough .
the dish was redone <UNK> the same result .
seemed the several cuts of snapper were bad .
one area for improvement is the basing of tables .

enjoyed good food last night around 000 .
good food gets it right .
- rrb - and went to go cash out .
they charged my account six times .
a 00 dollar bill !
all i needed was a straight answer .
the staff was very friendly and courteous .
the guac was excellent as usual .
the televisions were a bit dated too .
"a little pricey , but very good ! ! !"
avoid this place at all costs .
they make such good hot pocket .
"burrito is in america , really no mexico ."
it so bad i can not finish .
it ' s amateur night on weekends .
the ribs were out of this world good .
the pulled pork also was quite good .
"very moist , tender and flavorful ."
made a great sandwich .
which for myself is very unusual when eating out .
but the quality speaks for its self .
my take on tennessee grill is sub par .
wife had the ruben which was average at best .
anyway enough about that experience .
medium rare and medium rare plus .
wife fish and chips .
the jack daniel pie is the greatest .
reservations are not accepted .
restaurant is crowded and noisy .
manager sucked and food was worst .
he is a master of audience involvement .
this was cooked exactly as requested .
excellent price and service .
great place to grab lunch .
the salmon was succulent and not dry at all .
i go for golf .
service is prompt and courteous .
time to cut the cord .
what kind of customer service is this ?
where ' s the beef !
there was way more bun than burger .
as terrible as a meal could get .
high quality stuff on the rocks .
told me my room as recently renovated .
evidence of no floor care plan .
"on the upside , the blackjack dealers were great ."
"and lastly , no wifi ."
only old school cable internet .
this place has ruined me for all burritos !
it ' s a huge electronic store .
maybe i should avoid going on sundays ?
got a flat or leak ?
"mistake # 0 , not checking the order ."
only if i was given a killer deal .
service is friendly and quit to assist .
ca n't beat it .
this place is awesome .
look no where else .
absolutely the best way to start my day .
service and food quality are excellent .
i had a pressed sandwich with grilled vegetables .
lunch is the best value in town .
the teppanyaki tables are fun and entertaining .
this is the worst review i have given .
the service and food were not acceptable .
instead of just leaving as they should have .
welcome back to the 0000 ' s .
brilliant food and a very reasonable price .
"nice idea , poor execution ."
very pushy condescending salespeople / managers .
seems like a dining hall for the retirement community !
presentation of food is bad .
but that is just my opinion .
both were very satisfying .
"deserts were good , but nothing jaw dropping ."
atmosphere is <UNK> with loud thumping nonstop beats .
not for your grandmother or a romantic date .
very classy and unexpected .
this place lives up to all the good yelps .
my take is this is egyptian soul food .
we went here on a cold weekday night .
if your in chinatown this is an enthusiastic go .
so i wont return until it gets there .
el <UNK> does their paella very well .
cool and noisy ambiance .
a 00 on the rating scale .
. but my initial impressions have not changed .
your not going to find better .
the price points are good but not cheap .
food was excellent and service was friendly and attentive .
this dish is a real winner .
the duck was succulent and crispy .
this is an old school place .
the surprise here was the food .
i liked the overall experience here .
our table of three tried five different wines .
all of which were way above average .
the food was quite good .
the food is very good and the menu extensive .
if you do n't skip it or beware .

so next time i will pass on <UNK> pass .
bottom line : it looked and tasted sensational .
hats off to the pastry chef .
tuna tartar was very oily .
everything here tastes fresh .
been here multiple times .
if you have an option avoid this place .
the car now drives straight as an arrow .
. how can you go wrong ?
"had an order of the wings , hot ."
heard live music as i walked by another night .
i ' ve had 00 hour brew .
... out of prime rib .
. the last time they were under staffed .
check your final tab .
this happened twice before too .
food is average at best .
... pay with cash as you go .
food was good but not great .
the peanut butter crunch sounded interesting .
those burgers were good .
nothing really that special .
consistent with some of his other restaurants .
the bagel was stale .
really nice spa facility .
a beautiful view of las vegas .
"accommodating , friendly wait staff ."
the service is outstanding .
the food is very good .
average but good prices and personalized service .
<UNK> was dismissive of her presence .
thanks to google and yelp i found this company !
they fit the bill and always have .
ultimately they took care of us .
do not try to order for delivery .
"well , your driver just cost you a customer ."
this place is great .
the server replaced the drinks and all was well .
better <UNK> here than any other neighborhood place .
the grande chicken <UNK> is well worth the price .
we have those dual coils ' ' .
"good job , lindo ! ! 0 stars ."
the staff is also very friendly .
a variety of different head scratching illusions .
the accompanying salad was fresh and dressed well .
<UNK> © al beer on tap .
"tasty , simple food ."
"quick service , good price , nice little place ."
have n't been disappointed yet .
my wife and i could n't finish it .
they then suggested the coils .
seem like very honest people .
guess you have to be buddies with these guys .
restaurant is nice albeit a little crowded seating .
service started out quite slow .
duck confit would have been better .
"roasted and fried to death , with underdone sides ."
will give a second chance sometime .
great variety with superb staff and happening bar !
attractive place with good food at fair prices .
both the streaks and the sides were wonderful .
authentic to say the least .
great beer and surprisingly good eats .
their broasted chicken is insane .
try the spicy version .
is the crowd old ?
"like , maybe 0 oz ."
the spinach was uninspiring .
about this particular pei wei .
i say : bring back the <UNK> .
she got it right on the third try .
as for the meal .
way decent bar food for a reasonable price .
"first off , i read about the service here ."
some said it was lacking .
i almost licked the plate .
also the bacon was just right .
thick and tasty and cooked to perfection .
<UNK> over a recent <UNK> or paper cut ?
i think i recall it being good .
"nice ambiance , friendly waiter ."
what are you expecting ?
"fresh , jumbo prawns straight out of the atlantic ?"
this is joe ' s crab shack in arizona .
"really sweet server and hey , you know what ?"
i like this place .
"still , great little place ."
wow this place is terrible in every way .
the place smells disgusting .
it is a dingy gross old building .
"ok , i ' m a food fanatic ."
this is one of those .
"gorgeous atmosphere , good prices and excellent recipes ."
that ' s a shame .
they could answer the phone a little faster though .
what do you want more ?
. the town square app failed us .
"nice for a burger joint , definitely <UNK> friendly ."
i have absolutely no desire to revisit .
both we excellent as was the service .
try the peach cobbler you wo n't be disappointed .
man this place is the bomb .
i highly suggest u come here .
i ca n't say enough good things .
absolutely the most honest mechanics in town .
it was served with about a dozen plantain chips .
"as others have noted , the tacos are tiny ."
"the flavours are interesting , though ."
you could easily miss heads & tails .
but it ' s actually very cool .
the drinks menu is a little weak .
i tried one of their gin drinks .
almost all the gear and machines are brand new .
"in my opinion , cafes should n't be fancy ."
the clock certainly ticks all those boxes .
the permanent collection of both buildings is ... interesting ?
but <UNK> fell short of my very modest standards .
"so anyway , the food was not bad ."
"not great , but fine ."
"everything looks worn , ripped and / or faded ."
- uninspiring food menu .
"the food , though , was a big surprise ."
the chilli was obviously home-made and tasted great .
"for a weekend evening drink , go elsewhere ."
"the service was curt , slow and frustrating ."
probably two stars for that effort .
a side of fries is about # 0.00 .
the interior is <UNK> .
the staff are all <UNK> .
there is no alcohol license in cafe <UNK> !
but it is byob with no corkage .
"inside is extremely compact , as you would expect ."
it looks cheap and is not comfortable .
now let ' s get serious here .
i strongly recommend checking it out .
avoid like the plague .
"ok , fair enough , the fault was mine ."
a complete waste of time .
worst dry cleaners ever .
yelp does it again .
pork chop and duck breast was next .
you wo n't be disappointed .
. how can you beat that ?
these things are incredible .
some fresh cracked pepper makes it just absolutely perfect .
i had the bone in rib-eye .
this is a decent hotel .
the building itself needs updating .
the food at breakfast is ok .
the other working machine is all out of stock .
internet access is $ 0.00 per day .
they are clean and functional .
i like this airport .

nice atmosphere and good service .
the mixed bbq plate is solid of course too .
awesome interesting inexpensive place .
like a japanese tapas place .
well it hits the same spot at least .

better than t & t at the luxor .
needless to say my wife got hammered .
for the price the pastries flat out suck .
"third , the service kind of sucks ."
this place is a good little fried chicken spot .
seems like a deal but read on please .

the carribean food here is consistently good .

one of my staples .
it is overpriced for quality and quantity .
my poor decision to their poor food quality .
chipotle is normally pretty good nationwide .
the atmosphere was par for the course .
my new favorite restaurant in the phoenix area !
"the atmosphere is greek <UNK> , but nothing incredible ."
i ' ll continue staying here on business trips .
the only problem is the food .
it might pass for somebody unfamiliar with asian food .
"rating on phoenix standards , the place is okay ."
i recommend the mediterranean gyro .

good price beer on tap from germany .
service was very good .
just do n't order a <UNK> .
they also have the best italian hoagie .

<UNK> your own arm if it comes to it .
average mexican food here .
just had dinner there with my wife .
my wife had chicken <UNK> .
bill including two beers was $ 00.00 .
the portions are tiny considering the prices they charge .
my wife had a burger that was nothing special .
the bill including a standard tip was $ 00.00 .
no reason to come back .
only redeeming quality of this place is the bartenders .
the beers arent very good .
"standard , run-of-the-mill beers from a small brewpub ."
"will not be burned again , not worth it ."
the ambiance of the place is great !
very swanky in red and black .
nothing time consuming or extravagant .
a small carafe of chianti completed the meal .
<UNK> has european charm along with wonderful greek food !
ca n't leave <UNK> tasting the jackie o desert .
party of four dined on jan . 00 .
three of four were very happy with entrees .
the lasagna and ravioli special were similarly tasty .
the best thai in champaign county .
get the pad thai or the curry .
$ 0 ~ a beer + dart board .
if you can see this message by any chance .
. i understand shit happens sometime .
cherry and chevre strudel finished off the night .
we highly recommend safe security .
believe the bad reviews here .
"for sushi <UNK> , this place was meh ."
thanks for a vacation sore .
"outdoor seating relaxing , quiet ."
nice tasty twist on fried mozzarella .
only down side was dirty beer glass .
the mojitos are very good .
their microbrews are decent too .
but my real problem is value .
even electrical outlets that would n't work !
they agreed to take 00 percent off that bill .
. its on your room bill .
shame on you bellagio !
this is a great place for bbq .
"ribs , sandwiches , everything there is delicious ."
staff are friendly and pay attention to detail .
we will look here first before anywhere else .
overall the experience was excellent .
i had a positive experience with these guys .
i ' d give them my business again .
this place is suprisingly good considering its location .
good quality and prepared quickly .
"if you have n't eaten here , you should ."
it is located in the <UNK> station .
best pizza is san tan valley !
the spicy gyro is a fantastic sandwich !
this place is a lot of fun .
authentic cheesesteak sandwiches at a reasonable price .
native is your typical wing and bar restaurant .
the food is average but the atmosphere is fun .
never left you hanging or wanting for anything .
it is conveniently located and food is prepared quickly .
the sandwich at best was mediocre .
their olive oil selection is fantastic and tastes amazing .
fine dining in florence ?
a small <UNK> but with a fine dining environment .
"great for adults , not all that kid freindly ."
the service has always been <UNK> good .
the bar food is good .
i went last night and was underwhelmed .
the pizza was simply amazing .
beer selection was great .
"throughout the meal , he continued to offer excuses ."
both were very good .
this error was quickly corrected .
had the tenderloin last time and was suitably sated .
the hush puppies are plentiful .

good overall with excellent greek salad and falafel .
you ca n't go wrong here .
what ' s not to enjoy ?
the service here is outstanding every time we come .
the bartenders are excellent .
food was just not very good overall .
"service was quick , as was the kitchen ."
that ' s pretty steep .
go for the steaks .
herbs & rye is a vegas gem .
philly cheesesteaks are always good along with the fries .
second time i came with my girlfriend .
this place is the subway / chipotle of pizza .
all trips to best in show have been awesome .
overall no complaints the first visit .
unfortunately service was lacking my last visit .
service is definitely the best in the business too .
the clam chowder came out cold .
hopefully by then the kitchen will be sorted out .
do they do a good job ?
my car always comes out spotless inside and out .
so why the mediocre score ?
"other than that , their work is top notch ."
everything is consistent from the taste to the service .
but the downside to such an awesome place .
not to mention they make your sandwich super quick .
that attitude does not belong in the hospitality business .
i drive by this place everyday without looking twice .
your review helps others learn about great local businesses .
your review helps others learn about great local businesses .
i suggest you look elsewhere .
a lot better than new china .
you call that an excuse ?
"hey guys , i did n't mean it ."
they were as bad as ever .
as well as peace of mind .
has to ask twice for both .
he even let us take a picture with him .
come here if you want to save on breakfast .
definitely worth checking out .
i came here with my girlfriend on christmas night .
i highly recommend chris as a waiter .
i went with my girlfriend for lunch .
i ordered the cajun chicken pasta which was great .
we ordered surf and turf .
pros : big tvs !
the sangrias were pretty weak though haha .
other than that i would def return again .
i enjoyed the apps .
i was charged full price for my hh apps .
he then grabs the mgr .
so after this experience would i return ?
heard about this place from a friend .
came here on a monday late night .
really nice atmosphere the beer list is insane !
staff was very knowledgeable on their beer selection .
i mean she blew me away .
"kinda pricey , limited floor space for the games ."
a couple decent games .
well ventilated for all the people inside .
"the chefs are amazing , witty and very personable ."
pros - has a cool feel to it .
the rules are kinda ridiculous .
pros - had the <UNK> burger it tasted great .
"<UNK> here on thursday night football , and wow !"
surround sound was incredible .
00 $ for a <UNK> ?
cons - seriously ? ! none !
bottom line their kids give them a break !
i miss the bombay and <UNK> .
vegas has two water parks .
"great burgers , great atmosphere ."
also friendly staff made it a good experience overall .
mediocre bbq for north carolina .
it is indeed a cool place to eat .
good sushi in the middle of the desert .
staff is flexible and will take custom made orders .
but dinner fell flat .
"friendly , great food , great service ."
i ' ve been here several times without issue .
' ' why would i label this questionable ethics ?
<UNK> and pork butt were good .
ate here on a saturday night .
in no way compares to rodeo drive location .
i must say your pies were on point .
quick service and excellent pizza .
ice cold beer and friendly staff .
showed up and introduced themselves .
<UNK> the situation and began loading the truck .
you will not be disappointed .
what more could i say ?
eggs were good but the toast was simply amazing .
i ' m a big penn and teller fan .
he ' s a <UNK> .
he ' s not a very good one .
that ' s about it .
<UNK> that ' s where the <UNK> runs out .
"go ahead , i ' ll wait ."
you want a guitar to jam on ?
just the right amount of savory and sour .
"the waiter we had , <UNK> , was great ."
unique ordering with friendly staff .
are you a cowboy ?
a wan na be ?
then this is the place for you .
"do it , you know you want to ."
<UNK> bbq is not easy to find .
it was 0.00 and well worth it .
best drum shop between chicago and memphis !
i stop by anytime i ' m in town .
excellent selection and service .
well it is what it is .
this place is legit .
he makes his own sausage in-house .
i also know they are not serving commodity beef .
"went there tonight , monday night ."
"received my order bagged up , and drove off ."
"outstanding menu , pricing , and service ."
ca n't say enough good things about these guys !
the fields are big here .
half off beer and appetizers .
bartender was a cool dude too .
i cleaned my plate .
tried the pork carnitas plate on my first visit .
at minimum that person should be with a trainer .
the patrons - all locals with families .
apparently everything is home-made .
greatest bbq restaurant we ' ve tried .
whats with the attitude ?
perfect location for fast meeting or morning cup .
ricky the instructor was really motivating and encouraging .
the rooms are pretty decent sized .
"the staffs here are friendly , and generally helpful ."
did n't even finish my meal .
go to monta or ichiza or ramen sora .
"sometimes its really tender , and sometimes its not ."
excellent fish and service .
you can also choose beef or seafood .
i have to say that it is much better .
the beef tartare was also excellent .
the bad : the broth was not very good .
the bluefin tuna steak was a disaster .
expensive if you consider asian roast pig prices ... .
unfortunately on my recent visits they were simply out .
man that bowl looks good when it comes out .
"monta , fukumimi are better choices ."
best plumbers in town .
fair price and impeccable work .
"excellent work , prices and customer service ."
kind of a strange patio dining area out front .
very slow during lunch .
* * * tao <UNK> * * * 0 .
things to know : 0 .
"magically it becomes free , including 0 day beds ."
the room is a great size .
everything was neat and clean with good lighting .
i came for business and had several good nights .
"the staff is extremely nice , helpful and responsive ."
"a must first stop in madison , wi ."
now i see why .
the follow up was great .
reasons why i love vegas ... places like this .
"prices very reasonable , and the cuisine was solid ."
he really wants you to stay and enjoy yourself .
"prices reasonable , and portions very fair ."
last service was at 00k miles .
you ca n't beat the value for your money !
what ' s not to like ?
what ' s up with the reviews ?
the food is great here .
out of this world to be exact .
part of my top ten best sandwiches .
i got the <UNK> sage fried chicken & waffles .
very decent chinese buffet .
decent sandwich shop with plenty of options .
"turkey , cranberry sauce , stuffing , and mayo ."
do n't eat the breakfast ... utter shit .
highly affordable awesome value and taste !
chicken strips ... what more can i say .
the baked mac & cheese was awesome as well .
i ordered double burger with onion ring .
burger was just average .
the music was good the place was clean .
it is a crime .
there are other ways to make money .
someone needs to get fired over it .
i got ta say i had amazing time .
cant wait to return .
this place is a joke .
thank you sir for awesome work .
this place is amazing .
this place is awful .
service sucks but food is good .
thank you for great service zipps keep it up .
this is place is alright .
food is good and decent price .
"great food , delicious cheap coffee , awesome service ."
frankly anyone can afford it .
my friend did like the grilled squid .
thank you to brian and his staff !
i have been to one in <UNK> city .
food here is the same .
great food and menu .
simple and perfectly cooked .
paired with a nice acidic <UNK> di <UNK> .
and <UNK> was the perfect complement to the fish .
so many flavors that match so well .
this is as good as it gets .
"the service was top notch , the presentation <UNK> ."
the food absolute and the wine amazing !
best hand made pastas anywhere .
best in the valley .
i ' m very late writing this review .
i would travel across country to eat here .
"staff was friendly , food was very good ."
what the heck was the cook thinking ?
let ' s talk about the food and presentation .
all were served on a plain white plate .
there is no comparison .
"desert : skipped , they only offered italian ice ."
"mmm , yakitori shrimp with head on ."
"sens , cheuvront , breadfruit ."
"do n't expect gourmet , silverware or place settings ."
this place is just starting to come back .
not many selections beyond the basic fish .
my very top favorite was the pork belly crepe .
$ 00 average for a plate of ok mexican ?
you ' ll do better to hit filibertos unfortunately .
the food here is excellent .
i ' ll be going back very soon .
everytime i go to this place i wonder why .
i ' m an idiot .
- rrb - no big deal .
ambience different than i expected .
regular hours through the week .
"green beef , pork and fish ."
you are far <UNK> in taco land .
service has always been excellent .
get the yakitori shrimp with head on .
food does not get any better than this .
what are you doing in an asian restaurant ?
- rrb - offered some housemade lychee <UNK> shots .
"thanks johnny , your place is a now favorite ."
very crispy thin slices that have terrific toppings .
"cold , lifeless and disgusting ."
prices are mid to high for sushi .
that ' s exactly how they tasted .
also the complimentary bread here is awesome .
. 00 $ family meal .
. just clear runny slime .
the fried rice was cold and and dried out .
"for real though , this place blows me away ."
"for reference , everything house modern serves is delicious ."
nothing even like them .
highly recommended from a sushi junkie .
"and not a <UNK> one , by the way ."
"love home smoked , quality bbq ?"
you ' ll thank me later .
undoubtedly the best pizza outside of italy .
oh yeah ... the pizza is that good .
. this is n't cici ' s .
this place is hard to review .
"0-0 star meal , max ."
they were advertised as live crawfish outside .
easily the worst cajun boil i ' ve seen .
this place is a great mom-and-pop kind of joint .
not for sushi or food snobs .
"that said , the food is really good too ."
"this is a bustling , busy place ."
very disappointed to say the least .
my wife and kids did n't like it either .
after i placed my order i paid with cash .
"however , the <UNK> are against them ."
my loyalty has expired and here is why .
yesterday i took my car in for a wash .
the guy wants to sell me a full detail .
a vip wash took almost two hours .
you will not survive with this motto .
i ' ve been here a few times .
"however , today was much different ."
damage control should have been the waiters priority .
her attitude towards the situation outweighed the burnt fish .
a sad homage to the hilton name .
no problem with the actual care at the facility .
nicely sauced and spiced .
appropriate quantity and price .
chef specials are always creative and very good .
"completely satisfied customer , since sales department till financial ."
ambiance is very good .
"trust me dude , do n't do it ."
margaritaville is the jimmy buffet entry for vegas .
so bad and good things going for it .
no more celebrity chef restaurants .
the apps were fair .
was it worth the money - nope .
"great food , great service , great value ."
"lastly , we had the beignets as breakfast dessert ."
a very relaxed and enjoyable experience .
run do n't <UNK> to grand lux cafe .
i would not recommend this place .
the food was bland .
the service was very good .
the food was only fair .
nobody else was there .
they were just robots going through the motion .
most amazing rib eye you will ever have !
the beef is massive and cooked to perfection .
i ' ve also tried the <UNK> rib eye .
. it was almost equivalent to eating donuts .
". doughy , buttered and dusted with sugar ."
this place oozes vegas in all senses .
spanish tapas / small plate style .
. probably because of the chorizo .
"and fourth , the item that stole my heart ."
"straight up , yo ."
"see ya soon , mccarran ."
it ' s probably because they moved to luxor .
the <UNK> pipe sections were badass .
. just like my old man .
". canadian , japanese , german and so on ."
the italian sausage was tremendous .
it was a little too soupy for my blood .
so naturally when the song blasted .
. * the digital effects were phenomenal .
. it puts everything into an <UNK> perspective .
"literally , our ramen showed up within minutes ."
planning on tossing a few back ?
. i ' m just sayin ' .
do some people observing and find em ' !
"bao down , when i ' m <UNK> bound ."
through the haze of mixed smoke and shady characters .
. meaning it looks like an old school diner .
the menu was simple .
this was the case for the next two combos .
as for the food .
they ' re then breaded and cooked to order .
these things would actually go great with a <UNK> !
when i ' m back in vegas .
pays homage to sinatra & the big band era .
". seriously , they alone could steal the show !"
"i repeat , vegas ."
"no , no , no ."
". orange bang , bang ."
then into my stomach .
. for me at least .
my aunt had comps .
. not a sight for sore eyes .
the scrambled eggs were submerged in water .
". well , the bacon looked pretty damn amazing ."
the pancakes were good .
they did n't seem old .
nice selection of syrups over here as well .
pops needed a <UNK> foot <UNK> for his keyboard .
the brass section was kind of cool .
"bing , bang , boom ."
mum ' s meatloaf is served sandwich style .
the ambiance is true pub .
the pot bread was truly a surprising delight .
in this case it was a complete winner .
very subtle and nice .
". in fact , it was quite the scene ."
the <UNK> was what the doctor ordered .
"i was full , but kept eating ."
flavor in every bite and never ever lacked it .
i guess this is what those clever folks call .
. - rrb - and buttered corn .
a host of large salad offerings are also available .
"active , light and bright atmosphere ."
taste on all items was great .
"great job pizza me , and congratulations !"
a big thank you to steve and ray .
"yelpers , you will not be disappointed ."
"well done , guys !"
"00 minutes later , the work was complete ."
well done <UNK> and frank .
"no apology , just is what it is ."
the dreaded grinding brakes .
there was no avoiding that .
a customer for life .
"clean , friendly , just an overall great experience ."
you absolutely will not be disappointed .
hmmmm ... i digress .
not a <UNK> or speck of dirt left behind .
a big thank you to ed .
"yelpers , you will not be disappointed ."
hot turkey roast with a side of fried okra .
friendly service and great presentation of the sandwiches .
can be pretty loud but very good sushi .
still a great theater to see movies uptown .
two things are great about this .
they also had a good beer selection .
the food presentation is very good .
the food itself is solid .
this place is really a hidden gem .
the special is always outstanding .
i go here every other thursday .
"dark , dirty looking , almost looked closed ."
seemed to have problem with english .
not so after you are a customer .
"ok , it happens ."
what do you think about this .
"joanna , is a great barber ."
i was promised a 00 minute delivery .
was told pizza will be there in five minutes .
their pickup special is the best in the city .
it appears to be all about greed .
if i had n't paid i would have left .
it ' s mostly an indoor swap meet .
they do have an outstanding ranch though .
overall it ' s your typical gyro place .
this place has gone out of business .
the donuts are good but not great .
however the personable service is top notch .
ca n't go wrong .
you wo n't see me again anytime soon .
let me put this into perspective .
you lost my business home depot .
not a winning combination for any restaurant .
kings is no exception .
"the establishment is nice , they people are nice ."
glad to see a business who cares .
this place clearly has a staff and management problem .
wo n't be back solely base on the service .
cousins subs are awesome .
trust the reviews you see on here .
that many people ca n't be wrong .
smash burger is good .
you might aswell put straight yogurt on the gyro .
"then they served bland , undercooked , generic fries ."
give this place a try you wo n't regret .
the reviews way oversell the food .
i should have known better .
the building is old and dirty .
that ' s how a car wash should be .
"i will absolutely be back , well done ."
oh and their smoothly machine was out forever !
last couple trips have been much better .
there is n't a bad thing on the menu .
very flat pita bread with minimum tzatziki application .
overall my experience at this place was awesome .
overall a great place to shoot .
how do you describe a cal ranch store ?
what can i say this pace is something different .
i has the miso ramen which was excellent .
"dirty , grimy and filled with desert rats ."
"it is nothing fancy , friendly and reasonably priced ."
the food was very good .
the service was outstanding .
the location that puts this venue over the top .
"and the breakfast was great , a nice variety ."
"the place , setting and location are great ."
beer selection is better in my house .
no amber ales or pale ales .
all the beers are for college kids .
"also , the waiter i had was excellent ."
very friendly and helpful guy .
"great pho , great guys ."
"the egg rolls are excellent , too ."
the eggs were cooked correctly which was fine .
my meal was not worth finishing .
"not great , but not bad either ."
both are constantly good .
"so , we stumbled across the barrel grill ."
the staff was very friendly .
great group of guys there .
it looks exactly like the image i brought in .
good greasy slices and it is cheap .
total cost was around $ 000 with taxes .
normal variety of hong kong style buns .
best pizza in vegas imo .
the manager said he isnt responsible .
they cater the cheese cake thats why its good .
get it and you will not regret it .
one table game in the whole joint ! ?
great atmosphere and service .
i will be coming back .
the casino layout is also unusual .
the invoice has a price completely different .
every aspect of my experience here was 0 stars .
very greasy and flavorless .
very overpriced compared to other options on the strip .
but that is about all that was good .
the casino was ghetto .
extremely loud and obnoxious .
": - rrb - meh , imperial dump sucks ."
everything was an issue .
this place is overrated .
there is rarely anything neat going on .
far away from the strip .
as in three buses .
"good casino layout , and food at the restaurants ."
feet but the space is put to good use .
it has a nice feel to the place .
both the table and slot layouts are perfect .
"the selection was very , very limited ."
not bad for a bus station at all .
the security is very good here .
everything about monte carlo seems dull .
the various shades of <UNK> and browns <UNK> that .
shame on harrah ' s .
best view i have ever had at any hotel .
this review is for casino only .
nothing stood out as good whatsoever .
saturday night was the <UNK> .
i had such high hopes for this place .
this is a well ran public transport agency .
i think they have made it fairly straight forward .
i found the employees to be pretty friendly too .
graveyard seems to be their weakest staff .
no complaints at all .
back to their old tricks .
the drug of choice for low <UNK> : marijuana .
half the shops were vacant .
something both unique and <UNK> at an unbeatable price .
<UNK> complicated to navigate .
the rooms here are very nice .
which is to say large and well appointed .
the rooms are still very luxurious .
the staff is incredibly friendly and professional here .
this was my favorite place to play table games .
"the layout is welcoming , as is the variety ."
it was much more busy than normal .
major downgrade for palazzo .
probably screwed up my play rating .
the elevators were very slow for some reason .
"the casino layout was nice , but unwelcoming ."
i actually had no desire whatsoever to play anything .
the absolute worse part was the casino stench .
the identity players club is a total rip .
kids with ice <UNK> of beer at the tables .
that was pretty harsh .
i would not do business with them .
service was hella slow .
the cheese enchiladas were not that bad .
the red and green sauces were both good tasting .
"tonight completely different look , taste and different people ."
nielsen ' s is doing it right .
five stars say it all the way !
i would defiantly use carpet monkey again .
how bad can you screw up pizza right ?
excellent service very good food .
"had the combination 0 enchilada , taco and tostada ."
nice atmosphere for a sit down place .
service was prompt and very good .
easily the best thai food in arizona .
the food is fantastic for vegans and carnivores alike .
go see michael jackson one instead .
you will be amazed at that show .
avoid the salad bar as it is nothing special .
"fun , great food , classic old-school feel ."
the finance manager blatantly lied to my face .
ca n't trust them avoid this place .
had the chicken and beef <UNK> platter .
great family place on a sunday morning .
the place is awesome .
great atmosphere and a good staff .
sunday afternoon with really no crowd .
salad took another 00 minutes to finally be served .
one and done in going back to this site .
this little place did not disappoint .
delicious mexican food for cheap .
"i had the fajitas , which were excellent ."
literally more runners than the la marathon .
great drinks and great burgers ... .
great pool for sls las vegas guests ... !
the sides with it were good .
i find charging for hot water ridiculous .
great time excellent atmosphere .
went well beyond the job to make everything work .
he handled a two man job all by himself .
the ambience is great at this place .
the whole trip from start to finish was amazing .
a couple interesting eateries too .
this is a great alternative .
in the emerging ` ` arts district ' ' .
this review i want to say .
but i took him here to scottsdale vet .
i bought airline tickets to spread him over disneyland .
the food horrible i should have made my own .
food just was not that good .
i got the spaghetti and meat sauce .
. bets out red lobster and there cheaper .
best place for seafood .
they charged me for every coke i had .
"warm , inviting , and inclusive atmosphere ."
the service was excellent .
very attentive without being overbearing .
my rate is more of a 0.0 star .
"only my first visit , but it went great ."
have scheduled future appointments .
checked out a new place for dinner .
come pre game here .
just an all around bad experience at cosmos .
unfortunately when the food finally arrived it was terrible .
great idea putting it in a pretzel roll .
"the presentation , food and drinks were top notch ."
"the bartender , carlos , was an awesome chap ."
"mind you , these are important ."
this place does it right .
"the bartender , jessie , was a cool chap ."
the atmosphere in this place is awesome .
this is what a pub should look like .
third time may be the charm .
"great guy , very helpful , personable and attentive ."
everything you want and need in a driver .
we were greeted with professionalism and attended to regularly .
they suck ... jake rocks !
honest work at an honest price .
absolutely the worst place you can stay in vegas .
"also , the doner sandwiches are good ."
the <UNK> and deserts taste great .
very fresh and unique combinations .
my wife had the scallop risotto .
save your money and your taste buds .
best butter chicken in the city .
amazing company and very fair prices .
service was excellent and super fast .
staff and service was excellent .
you guys are amazing .
i did the top gun package best helicopter company .
the kiki burger was ok .
some of the starters are really good as well .
do yourself a favor and visit <UNK> <UNK> !
wine and italian food go hand in hand .
three of us ordered 0 eggs over .
an excellent and inexpensive local place .
seemed she was used to serving drinkers .
this is a solid 0 star place .
this one was good .
i would rate the food a five .
"perfect ambience for conversing , no loud music ."
great song selection and excellent service .
"the fish , pork and carnitas ."
walked out under 00 bucks .
the devils scramble is really good .
"egg , chorizo , peppers ."
just the hot if you like it spicy .
fresh food is to word here .
then an awesome pizza .
the reviews were spot on .
chips and salsa were decent .
the grilled fish tacos were really excellent .
they are normally very good .
0 hour and 00 mins later .
will have to try something different .
then for the drunken noddles that i saw reviewed .
nice looking place and very nice staff .
really good and fresh squid and sea weed salads .
i will be back for sure .
incredibly slow and inefficient .
"walked in , was greeted , and sat down ."
. reminds me of chinese to-go places .
"nothing really bad or great , just good ."
the rush had already gone through .
"after all was done , said , and eaten ."
plus you get vitamin c and <UNK> .
it was an l & l look alike .
this will fill you up for the price .
the garlic ahi was a bit bland .
joe and phil decided to get it anyway .
the girl at the desk greeted with a smile .
take him to jess ' house ?
are you sure you ' re gay ?
what ' s your name ?
biggest club i have seen thus far .
"right night to come to krave , i suspect ."
that is kind of true .
nothing i find <UNK> .
. so poor thing .
the shop carries top end products at fair prices .
its not a museum in the traditional sense .
i went with a 0 on the spiciness .
my chief complaint was with the portion sizes .
i definitely recommend qc <UNK> !
this was actually my third attempt to eat here .
"once seated , service was prompt ."
ended up going with a coke .
it was quite refreshing .
i noticed that everything seemed fairly cheap .
"the food arrived fairly quickly , i assumed ."
pretty much looked like a cheapo supermarket hamburger bun .
it was generally good but not particularly good .
the service and ambiance were very good .
the steak just was n't good .
service was good and prompt .
washed them down with some delicious japanese beers .
followed this up with the beef wrapped mushroom yakitori .
it was one notch above terrible for me .
it was a buffet style breakfast with live music .
well i was wrong .
the food for the most part was again terrible .
would stay again but only if wifi improved .
she was very attentive and truly a genuine person .
i highly recommended it to anyone .
same great food service as tempe .
i highly recommend these guys .
live piano is a nice touch .
drinks are reasonable - menu is simple but good .
stayed last weekend and did not enjoy .
room was not cleaned despite calling room service twice .
light switches in room did not work .
i tried the crispy pork belly sandwich .
service was sluggish at best .
"ok , here ' s the deal ."
i eat out for lunch everyday m-f .
i do not want to under sell this place .
such precision and fast movement .
price - - better than subway .
"the sub is about a <UNK> , for 0.00 ."
put that in your toaster and toast it subway !
now what are you waiting for ?
great beer and wine selection .
without a doubt best new restaurant in old town .
the staff really made me feel at home .
they serve it like a belgian <UNK> beer .
no sweetener or dairy needed .
"robust , round on the pallet ; clean finish ."
highly recommended for the savory connoisseur .
but the coup de grace was the grits .
and i ate them .
in a condescending tone - rrb - .
the burger was awesome and well cooked .
the el rico is the best !
everything else there ranges from 0.00 to 0 stars .
the place is very loud .
it came with fries which were n't anything special .
clark tire is awesome !
needless to say my first impression was not great .
the flavor is awesome .
. i hope this helps anybody reading this .
it ' s just a pretty awesome place .
rotisserie chicken sandwich is awesome !
this place has gone down hill steadily .
the food is excellent .
it could almost be a meal in itself .
great local restaurant in fountain hills .
"the food here , however , was subpar ."
authentic ny pizza and personality .
highly recommend to anyone in the area .
"firstly , it is pretty much all italian ."
and most of the goods are from italy .
"but , the overall food is not bad ."
thumbs down great normal american dinner .
really nothing more to say .
pretty much everything is good for a dinner .
not a place you would want to eat in .
the service is slow and sloppy .
our meals came out cold .
"and , to boot !"
the bar food is half price .
typical bar and typical charlotte food aka crap .
the staff is not very helpful at all .
"and , there is very little riff raff ."
if not stay away .
a private school is near .
also prepare for dirt all over the place .
then this is for you .
the food is not bad at all .
that should have been the sign .
stay away if you want real <UNK> food .
nice area and nice people .
gave tonight a shot and back at it .
great local place to get pretty much anything fixed .
now here is the part that gets me .
gets whatever you need or want done fast .
very surprised by the staff .
it ' s been moved three times .
not much else to say great dog park .
best japanese food 0 charlotte and authentic .
meh normal party store but do n't expect help .
just a nice place to come and relax .
nothing like this around .
give the place a shot .
just the flavor went through the whole meal .
so stay away from that .
the mega meat is fantastic .
from the hour they opened till 0pm .
do yourself a favor and do not go there .
this place is not good .
all you can eat crab buffet was excellent .
"for the price , there are better choices around ."
another bartender who left early was awesome .
the bartender did not shake my margarita .
it feels like a secret hole-in-the-wall place .
we finished our meal with a peanut butter cup .
well worth the trip .
i am looking forward to becoming a regular .
"great food , wait staff , and atmosphere !"
"i have a 0000 <UNK> outlook with 00,000 miles ."
i got the oil change <UNK> everything seemed good .
should have called it the <UNK> .
i had pulled pork and brisket .
had a gyro and fries which were outstanding .
is the lobby and casino dated ?
the shops a bit few and lacking <UNK> ?
stink of 00 years of smoke and vomit ?
a base of operations ?
circus circus is good enough !
who in the hell salts chicken nuggets ?
wife got lucky : she got two sandwiches .
and do n't sell me fat .
i friggin hate that .
"prices have gone up , <UNK> ."
do n't make me go there .
the food is ok .
the food here is out of this world .
this place is great .
the food is top notch .
great restaurant for authentic sichuan cuisine .
the best and most authentic chinese restaurant in pittsburgh .
the drinks and service was excellent .
stick with the drinks and burritos .
"0/0 sides : mashed <UNK> , solid ."
served w / a nice sauce to boot .
the service is 0/0 .
still good solid sushi place .
i ' ll be back .
friendly staff but very average at best food .
best in scottsdale likely .
some unique burgers and sides are awesome too .
i ' m a service guy ' s nightmare !
the food is always great here .
great atmosphere and love the food .
pretty tasty for a discount fish place .
but they were very good plain fries .
the food is always outstanding .

you do n't find that everywhere .
the food is fantastic .
the food is outstanding and so much of it .

i like the westin .
i did n't see a single cockroach .
lets talk about the bar .
parking will add another $ 00 / night .
these little things added up .
however things quickly took a turn .
maybe this is there demographic ?
wanting a real cocktail i ordered a negroni .
i ordered chicken marsala which was uninspired .
i ' d give it a 0/0 .
sadly it was staffed by average looking dudes .
i know that is important to some people .
like tsa airport tight .
maybe they ' re the same guys .
see ` ` <UNK> ' ' above .
i kinda wonder if they have any actual glassware .
the club has a weird <UNK> thing going on .

. all i have to say is wow .
these guys are freaking awesome .
keep up the awesome work .
"nice place , nothing to write home about ."
price for quesadilla was high for the portion .
they fixed the tire with no attempts to upsell .
really 0 + stars .
"well done , i will be back ."
"too overly rehearsed , nothing seemed natural or new ."
the service was lacking in a big way .
nothing that the free hotel magazine could n't fix .
this review is for cox service not this store .
he skipped our table for some reason .
there were about 00 people in the restaurant still .
management really should do something about this issue .
this place is awesome .
honestly this place is 0 at most .
the pizza is good and the deserts are great .
everything was great and the food was awesome .
thank you joanna and the whole training crew !
no complaints - - had a great stay here .
beautiful estate and admirable architecture .
the pizza is the menu focus .
time on wednesday august 00th .
post phoned apt times from one day to next .
possibly some of the best mexican food in town .
for that it gets a star .
less a liquor store and more a liquor emporium .
all in what ' s basically a <UNK> barn .
the fish fry is really outstanding .
skip the fries and get the parmesan potatoes .
have i ever mentioned i was lazy ?
make sure to get reservations .
"back wages have n't been paid , etc . ."
ok - the food is incredible .
most of the stuff is from local farms .
good ` ` mexican ' ' food .
a great place for lunch or a quick dinner .
"actually , a little too nice for my tastes ."
the price tags here do n't equal the quality .
the staff at goodman ' s was excellent .
thin crust pies with an assortment of toppings .
tasty tacos in a slightly <UNK> interior .
<UNK> is one of those places .
but neither is $ 000k condo .
in all the bad ways .
what else do you need ?
if mickey ' s does n't <UNK> .
i think the cigarette smoke there may be <UNK> .
who says the midwest ca n't have tasty seafood ?
"average service , below average food and terrible atmosphere ."
"also , stay away from the brunch ."
<UNK> clearly provides a higher end dining experience .
"fuck you , <UNK> ."
small menu but the food ' s pretty decent .
"somehow , u-haul became synonymous with <UNK> yourself moving ."
there has to be an alternative .
"we get it , <UNK> ."
<UNK> tech tv makes running much easier .
menu is mostly comfort food staples .
highlight is the meatloaf of the gods .
lacking a bit in the really tasty food category .
eclectic sandwiches at reasonable prices .
the food and service are both equally sincere .
this is how truck rental should be done .
that might account for the ease of the transaction .
shuffleboard is the best bar game known to man .
really more things in life should involve banana peppers .
more places need to do this .
blockbuster - cup of coffee .
"however , at wah kee ."
"reasonable prices , quick service , and decent food ."
chat with the owner sometime .
"cold , snowy , and <UNK> ."
"no wait , cheap prices and attentive staff ."
now the new <UNK> ' s .
cheerful and pleasant staff .
"either way , it ' s worth a visit ."
"dave , i get it ."
your establishment serves lots of tasty meat .
the food at <UNK> ' s is consistently terrible .
i guess you can find great treasures here .
"well , they have booze ."
a goddamn castle of booze .
the draw for me is the <UNK> bar .
nice beer on tap .
"otherwise , pretty standard fare ."
"which you probably are , you drunk ."
the old fashioned is a <UNK> to wisconsin cuisine .
' ' i hate this place .
stay the hell away .
"not yet , <UNK> ."
all this with a milkshake .
not your delivery pie .
"nothing stood out but again , nothing offended ."
"tasty , somewhat gourmet sandwiches ."
great little sides as well .
subway this place is not .
"also , doubles as a respectable little deli ."
never been disappointed here .
<UNK> can suck it .
they sell fried cheese curds .
you can replace your soda with a shake .
the fast food of choice when in wisconsin .
reasonable rates that clearly pay for themselves .
"that said , man , do i love gadgets ."
i once bought a 0 lb .
a far superior venue .
and the internet access ... the year is 0000 .
do not stop here .
kept interest the entire show .
great laughs the entire show .
room was outdated but who cares .
casino was maybe a 0.0 .
best deal at the luxor .
0 tacos and 0 sol beers for $ 00 .
i do not recommend this place .
food was below average .
look somewhere else for your water softener needs .
look somewhere else for your water softener needs .
hard to find a goose island <UNK> anywhere else .
this has all become a racket for making money .
only authentic mexican food in champaign .
choose a theme and stick with it .
hopefully all locations are not like this one .
so i guess you take your chance going .
the vegetable ' s were fresh an not overcooked .
former chef from <UNK> ' s makes this possible .
"yes , everyone loves this place ... right ?"
"professional and reliable , i highly recommend don masters ."
what ' s all the fuss ?
the dead duck inn ?
joe ' s local chinese gag house ?
are those places that great ?
it ' s not pei wei !
the food is fresh and prepared to order .
makes me hungry just <UNK> ' about the joint .
"sure , it ' s not chang ' s ."
"and , you wo n't find msg ."
this place is a gem .
skip the buffets and other non sense .
this has the highest quality food and service .
the quality of ingredients are second to none .
"everything is great : food , service , ambiance ."
do not judge this book by its cover .
the real maple syrup is a big plus .
the service was good and quick .
i highly recommend jose andres ' margarita .
small quantity and $ 00 but a must try .
"street parking was fine , no problems ."
"<UNK> , not quite sure where to start ."
what happened to everyone calling stuff out ?
dr . y is truly an expert .
the pizza here is great !
the waiter did a good job throughout .
the service is lacking .
the price is average for a nice breakfast place .
the business owner is responsive to complaints .
i had the peach ale .
"pretty good , fairly authentic food ."
good airport with friendly people .
"good , friendly service too ."
they have a full list of espresso drinks .
was told ` ` 00 minutes ' ' .
i only had to bike 0 blocks home .
the food was luke warm .
but that re heated burger - not good .
it does something to the texture of the meat .
there is serious competition in downtown phoenix now .
this place is not ready to succeed here .
full of surprises from a chef bursting with ideas .
very accomplished and very entertaining .
how many people would have that at their fingertips ?
food gets better every time i go .
breads - very good .
overall <UNK> deserves <UNK> based on these two experiences .
each dish was superb .
each dish was superb .
but at the old <UNK> <UNK> ?
"why 0 stars , given the above <UNK> ?"
i look forward to observing their evolution .
no one senior to her was in evidence .
downtown is starting to have a life .
of course you ' ll develop your own favorites .
- attentive unobtrusive service .
from day one - no small feat .
- amazed at the reasonable prices .
what more can be asked of life ?
"shine , well , shines at this location ."
their pastries are starting to get baked very morning .
"but for now , i ' m a fan ."
simply the best ice cream i have ever tasted .
this addiction could get worse than crack !
on a few levels .
with yelp consensus reviews .
<UNK> the lox is good .
<UNK> the good corned beef is piled sky high .
the food has become nothing short of spectacular .
"again , 0 stars if this could thrive anywhere ."
this place lives its ` fair trade ' philosophy .
they now have a liquor license .
the ice cream is very rich .
the flavors are solid .
starting to feel like a real city down here .
<UNK> french influence on the menus which ditto .
only in a city .
the only place i eat hot dogs in america .
what ' s up with the empty lot now ?
to make that happen nowadays takes something very special .
wine and cheese selection - excellent .
just sort of nonexistent .
"perfectly roasted beets , excellent medley of smoked fish ."
i must be in <UNK> world .
or <UNK> world stays put .
"very comfortable vibe , engaging <UNK> ."
"dominican food that is , simply , delicious ."
the opposite is true here .
i notice from other reviews that is not uncommon .
the place is designed well .
i hope the place survives .
i quite liked the unfiltered sake .
"service was prompt , knowledgeable and friendly ."
so why the 0 star ?
they ' re open until 00pm some nights .
they have food trucks some nights .
much better choices for the money .
. it was incredible .
five stars for the food .
i never had a better lobster bisque for starters .
. entree was a dream .
this is the best sushi restaurant in las vegas .
but that ' s about it .
this location is one of the best in town .
this place is more miss than hit .
wahoo ' s in a nutshell is healthy <UNK> .
their new citrus slaw taco is really delicious .
the outer reef burrito is quite good .
they have two custom coke soda fountain machines .
i much prefer flow rider truck .
this place is outrageously priced .
really impressed with the flavor and value .
just picked up a pizza to go .
this place is usually reliable .
i believe carlos was his name .
he added 0 pieces of sausage .
went with my girlfriend on a slow day .
the food was average at best .
very nice outdoor patio by the waterfront .
the only difference is the decor .
you wo n't be disappointed .
great service and a hidden gem .
"sincerely , matt k ."
thank you for making me aware of the situation .
the crust was good and just chewy enough .
the work they did on my truck is great .
"it was crowded , but the wait was short ."
cold sausage gravy is awful !
food was pretty good .
"great food , really good service ."
very much enjoyed my dinner experience here .
the atmosphere is great .
native chinese own and operate this business .
the wait staff was attentive and got everything right .
metro is a great place to kill the time .
really great staff here .
i ' m a big tiki culture fan .
i asked for a drink menu .
i asked if he could make a tiki drink .
this place is slow .
took my truck in for an oil change .
0 hrs later it still has n't got done .
this place is amazing .
the hotel is fantastic in pretty much all ways .
the food here is above average .
they at least squeezed some lime juice on it .
their sake menu is also fairly priced .
this place has great food .
great meat selection and seafood selection .
overall better than rest i have been in .
perfect service and good value .
try anything ... your taste buds will thank you .
"all in all , i highly recomend this hotel ."
the food was worth the somewhat spendy <UNK> .
my only issue with this place is the atmosphere .
it seems like an eternity before the entree arrives .
i guess the chef is really into slow foods .
this place is an absolute ripoff .
prince of india offered a pretty stellar groupon deal .
i took the plunge and am glad i did .
"in sum , do n't go ."
"basically , this place is terrible ."
i ate here last night .
"secondly , the quality of the food was laughable ."
"on the plus side , the service was good ."
the place was packed and the seating was cramped .
best <UNK> in vegas i went to .
"you ' ll be glad you did , mate ."
the whole thing was a mixed bag .
"first , the good stuff ."
"together , they put out a massive sound ."
"now , the bad stuff ."
together they put out a massive sound .
they have one level .
"<UNK> , <UNK> , victorian mansion , lace <UNK> ."
does he have talent ?
* next came the incredible entrã © e .
what an end to a spectacular meal .
you ' ll find incredible food at unbelievable prices .
"for my part , i never noticed the flaws ."
this place is kept in <UNK> shape .
"usual fast , efficient and jovial staff ?"
* 0:00 - bread and olive oil arrive .
* 0:00 - entrã © es finally arrive .
how about the food ?
wife took a few bites and quit .
what a complete waste of time .
"the ingredients are excellent , locally sourced i believe ."
"breakfast - big portions , pretty standard fare ."
the crab cake benedict is a nice touch .
"very disappointing , not recommended for lunch ."
food is served fast and hot .
not many great places to eat near my house .
my favorite place for standard breakfast fare .
i usually have their standard breakfast .
no dance floor but for some reason dance music .
facility is bright and clean which is a positive .
selection is ` ` just the hits !
. - rrb - focused on school programs .
i ' d agree with regard to the fairways .
great strip access without the smoky casino vibe .
has a distinctly contemporary / modern aesthetic .
the first two times they were great .
perfectly cooked and seasoned burger .
"the food was inedible , the service was worse ."
on the up side the view is nice .
i sat at the bar as i was alone .
the risotto had two small scallops with no sear .
their was virtually no crab in the dish .
not bad but just not great .
it was a <UNK> of some sort .
just keep that in mind when ordering .
and the atmosphere is comfortable and <UNK> .
great array of tvs and lots of games .
my personal favorite perk is the shuttle service .
the point actually comes to a point .
this is dane county regional airport .
i ' ve never had a good one here .
think upscale <UNK> <UNK> with a romantic jazz <UNK> .
wow amazing fresh food great asada !
had their breakfast burrito the best !
the map is cool ... sort of .
i did not see the value .
a staple anytime i ' m in montreal .
this is definitely a minimalist style food serving establishment .
it was a lot of fun .
you wo n't be disappointed .
pad see ewe is probably my favorite thai dish .
i was taken by surprise .
"the rooms were great , very nicely decorated ."
my first impression was .
ambiance a big zero .
place has gone down the tubes .
and how is that my fault ?
both are excellent choices .
shame on you good egg .
great new place in the hood .
several varieties of burgers and all freshly ground beef .
it would also attract more of a crowd .
great food and good drink specials during games .
the wings are great .
the chicken fried steak is out of this world .
never had anything bad here .
$ 0 for a personal pizza ?
perfectly cooked but unfortunately the sauce failed to deliver .
ramen is amazing here .
but for being downtown it ' s good .
i talked to the door manager .
have a good time .
"0 components , rice and fish ."
"other than that , the beer selection is great ."
second time i ' ve been here .
way better than inn n out .
0/0 always a fun place .
mo and <UNK> are great behind the bar .
no food here either which sucks for a brewery .
this is key to keeping tenants happy .
one perfect example shows the case .
you really ca n't beat that for service .
"it ' s another , average in n out ."
it ' s also cheaper then <UNK> .
best taco spot in az hands down .
this place is excellent !
best mexican food in casa grande !
fried fish tacos and <UNK> hot dog are great .
but for now its only gets 0â 0/0 stars .
great place for breakfast .
they the borderline special .
all i have to say is bbq cuban .
u the fries are back jack .
update do not stay here .
parking is a mess and way over priced .
great window tinting service .
thanks the sushi is great here .
ask for the samurai special its great .
must be good right .
best carne asada tacos in az . .
the food is so good here .
outstanding in every way .
rio rico is a very friendly <UNK> to dine .
very friendly and hospitable owners .
the service was great and the food was spectacular .
you wo n't be disappointed .
just wrap it in bacon and broil it .
ambiance and staff was a + .
it looked like the sushi was nice .
half of the rear bumper had swirl marks .
always nice to run into a celebrity .
"oh yea , place was a little small too ."
not very grand at all .
"cheap drinks , nice bartenders , low-key ."
the service is usually pretty good .
their breakfast food is only so-so .
"authentic mexican food , good service ."
t-mobile shame on you .
they did an excellent job with the remodel .
waited 00 min for a waiter to help us .
the place was not busy .
yes go here now .
so far so great with these guys .
good balance between trendy and comfortable .
this place is great .
i got their special .
totaling a little over $ 0.00 .
"- food-wise , watch out ."
i ' d recommend that .
it makes for a pleasant and natural dining experience .
these guys did a really good job .
the bartenders are overall ok .
no real issue there .
- they ' re open 00 hours .
you almost forget your in phoenix when there .
the food is exceptional and reasonably priced .
i ' m also normally a pizza guy .
"this place is a legit , solid restaurant ."
"overall , it ' s a pretty nice place ."
$ 0.00 for a small soft taco .
quality food and quality atmosphere .
easiest 0 stars i ever gave in my life .
waiter gave me a sample of the smoked sirloin .
told him i was a ribeye guy .
but that smoked sirloin was <UNK> .
i also returned today to speak to a manager .
so here is my take .
unfortunately <UNK> is not one of those places .
best tacos in pittsburgh .
"pair with a <UNK> , sangria or apple soda ."
a fantastic combination of simple and complex flavours .
parking can be a challenge on fridays and saturdays .
"great atmosphere , excellent food , great service ."
what else is there ?
the staff was attentive but no overbearing .
i will be a regular .
and wow it was amazing .
the bbq sauce great too .
if only every customer service agent was this intuitive !
rob is a consummate professional !
one tapas dish was really fishy .
i do not recommend ibiza at all .
it ' s not really a great hotel either .
i ' ll summarize below .
the food is great .
a must in las vegas .
* epic water pressure !
my complaint is the size .
"the blackout curtains worked great , too ."
this place is an average place to stay .
a short but sweet review follows .
a t-bone steak at 0am ?
"by vegas standards , this place is a bargain ."
<UNK> - the service .
the key word for our experience was : disappointment .
. king <UNK> <UNK> .
adults need their own version of disneyland as well .
"but really , a balance needs to be struck ."
. like 0 of you out there still left ?
highly recommended is the fish n chips .
"its a very relaxing , mellow atmosphere ."
both days pretty similar .
the service was excellent .
they are might good too !
now this is where it ' s at !
"great friggin ' burgers , shakes , and fries !"
even the syrup did n't help it much .
"i have had different pies , wings and pasta ."
the beef had good flavor but super dry also .
the presentations were tight and delivered well by cam .
this place was a <UNK> from gordon or holstein .
place was decent no complaints more pros overall .
four stars great experience great tour .
blow up on the dry flats or lake bed .
i ' m taking my wife here someday .
this place has nothing you need of quality .
<UNK> selection is minimal at best .
great price and lots of good quality <UNK> .
big selection and cheap as internet pricing .
i send all my clients here .
this is my fourth golds gym .
if you live here its not a problem .
as far as locker rooms .
sauna is big but outdated wood .
service was a joke .
people are nice to get you signed up .
the equipment is ok .
the locker room is small .
perfect place to do cardio and nothing else .
thats the only thing that was good .
that is only if the food is good .
the bread was better then my steak .
the cardio and weighted machine setup is odd .
so i moved into the free weight room area .
great ammo prices for range time .
would recommend to a friend .
the place was good not great not bad .
the one and only downside .
probably the best pool i saw in phx .
all fire and no flavor .
"vindaloo was pretty hot , but no complexity ."
as good as it gets .
the filet with blue cheese was excellent .
the worst valet service in vegas .
sent the food back as it tasted off .
pies seemed a bit odd too .
texture wasnt quite right .
the best sandwich shop in the universe .
cant add much to that .
"the bobbie , <UNK> , cheesesteak ."
great bang for the buck .
soup was very good .
add slow service and it <UNK> the experience .
jerry in the restaurant is not very <UNK> .
"nicely appointed , well kept ."
overpriced as all things wynn
this is the best <UNK> show in vegas .
i hope the proprietor can open in another location .
the place was great .
they serve 0 fillets of fish .
it is very americanized 00 .
it just seemed they like they did n't try .
the toppings were good particularly the sausage .
the cheese gave it away as a phony .
the waiters were all formally dressed .
the service was also excellent .
the bamboo club has an interesting history .
the environment is purely scottsdale .
you would offer a nice bar .
you would hire american people as your servers .
<UNK> cuisine involves tandoori items and grilled items .
the food is on the mild side .
the service and ambience was quite nice .
it was not spicy nor was it cooked properly .
i ' m a comics purist .
"instead , this is my typical experience ."
i do n't see anyone looking at comics .
gourmet house of hong kong 0 .
big wong and 0 .
the pizza is good but disappointing .
the yeast also takes away from the flavor .
"now regarding the actual place itself , skip it ."
and i paid 00 bucks for that .
"furthermore , they are slow ."
note : ignore the reviews above .
it ' s basically a dosa shop .
they also have excellent indian chinese dishes .
do n't think of this place like a restaurant .
negatives their <UNK> indian dishes are not so good .
their <UNK> shake is great .
the service was lousy .
we ordered an appetizer and two dosas .
this is not a restaurant by any means .
it was also expensive .
the tables are clean .
this is certainly not a date place .
i got a quote from <UNK> .
they were very direct and <UNK> .
the one positive was their pricing was fair .
it seems like they do a lot of homes .
this is a <UNK> restaurant .
this is not an indian restaurant by any means .
the waitress was condescending and the food was <UNK> .
it was really a scene out of a movie .
all of the dishes lack flavor .
the calamari is dry and flavorless .
the beer was mediocre .
there is a lot of attitude at this place .
the pizza has no taste .
oh yeah and did i mention the attitude ?
both were excellent but both also had something missing .
the quality of the food has changed .
it ' s curries are too watery .
the service is also pretty good here .
ahh ... the catch 00 of yelp .
he was fast and did a decent job .
and this place has changed for the worse .
"now , it almost feels like a glorified applebees ."
the crowd has gotten older .
the service was lousy .
the food is excellent .
it ' s a rip-off .
the food itself was excellent .
"while they were good , they were nothing special ."
"one more thing , this place is safe ."
the curries were great and so is the naan .
the place is dirty and deserves notice .
that ' s essentially postino in a nutshell .
the service was average .
' ' it ' s just a cafe .
the management does little to offset that .
"in fairness , management was listening ."
i think management deserves credit for that .
a noticeable change was the staff !
the management has to better control the parking area .
dressing well is not limited to scottsdale .
imagine mary smith goes to los dos molinos .
it ' s americanized mexican food at its finest .
the menu was also different and worse .
they replaced my bmw m0 windshield in april .
this is the same company that the dealerships use .
the installer was efficient and did a clean job .
the glass was oem .
this is a <UNK> restaurant not an indian one .
many of those items were basic .
they really take pride in their grilled items .
however this is not a vegan or vegetarian place .
so what ' s lacking ... flavor .
the hours of operation are weird .
the place closes at 0 pm even on weekends !
this is supposed to be a classy place .
here are the problems 0 .
that was n't the case here .
the place has 0 problems .
this place used to be ` ` india palace .
"instead , this place has become a joke ."
it ' s a mediocre cheap indian restaurant .
"honestly , i think honey bears is far better ."
there are several flaws with this place .
the baked beans had no flavor .
the sauce itself is underwhelming .
and that could n't be further from the truth .
the best sauces have flavor not heat .
sorry but phoenix deserves better .
<UNK> provides great service with a very personal touch .
- be loyal to the local teams .
- provide fast and reliable wi-fi .
the pizza was a 0/0 .
the sauce was tangy but not overpowering .
the flavor was spot on .
the cheese was good but not great .
and people should check it out .
it ' s in a divey strip mall .
but this is the best pho in the city .
this is one place where the food carries it .
india gate is one of these places .
do n't believe the hype .
this is nothing more than fast food mexican .
there is nothing special about it .
that all this salsa is .
very amateur to say the least !
the food itself is amazing at this location .
the service needs to improve even at the tables .
this is very unprofessional in my opinion .
i used this company through my home warranty .
they are also in the east valley now too .
"but with regard to service , they were outstanding ."
i used them through my home warranty in april .
"that being said , they do some nice things ."
the food is excellent .
"it ' s spicy , flavorful and well prepared ."
regarding the ` ` spice ' ' factor .
the waiters have attitude .
sometimes indian restaurants can serve warm beer .
that is b . s . 0 .
the food is spicy but it is n't hot .
they do not use reheated rice .
this place had fresh soft and sticky rice .
do n't take the american menu for granted .
bottomline : get both menus 0 .
the restaurant is not a hole in the wall .
water was refilled quickly 0 .
that ' s how it got <UNK> .
the food has n't changed .
is it worth the wait ... most certainly not .
the restaurant is narrow yet not claustrophobic .
there is a <UNK> server and an indian server .
the food : the food was well prepared .
the texture especially was captured right .
it was n't too hot or mild .
something that deserves mention was the chaat .
in the valley so something is working .
and your solution makes little sense .
this is a medical practice not a barber shop .
you ca n't compare it to a retail business .
there are plenty of <UNK> <UNK> in this city .
the food is good but incredibly <UNK> .
the service was great and timely .
the meat was succulent and not overcooked .
it was more or less just a curry .
it was improperly cooked .
this is the best indian restaurant in the valley .
a little disappointed this time .
the service was also a little lackluster .
it depends on who you get as your server .
they had no dance floor .
"the staff was friendly , classy and intelligent ."
i can echo their sentiments .
we even had a contact a the hotel .
i would recommend this place .
probably the second best comics shop in <UNK> .
<UNK> and good layout .
it should be thick enough to mix with rice .
the disappointing dishes include the <UNK> dishes .
bottomline : great food but order it to go .
the quality of the food is slipping .
the curries continue to become more watery .
i would only order carryout .
stick to the curries .
the service needs improvement .
i would stick to their curries .
it ' s the real deal .
the naan was excellent as always .
everything is pretty good on this menu .
"honestly , i have no complaints about the food ."
you can eat a full meal for $ 00 .
but i will say this dishes are prepared well .
the reason for that is the chandler location itself .
that chandler vibe is felt here .
just use common sense .
the service is outstanding .
they are not wannabe models or <UNK> .
it has a very homestyle <UNK> cuisine .
"however , he does a poor job returning calls ."
just be aware that this is not indian food .
it ' s designed to appeal to <UNK> .
their service is inconsistent .
and we paid for their highest level of service .
there have been other problems .
it eventually turned into another <UNK> club scene .
the truth is the other stores are garbage .
they do n't push any comics on people .
the shwarma is also the best in the city .
their humus is good but not very authentic tasting .
the service was also excellent .
this place is terrible for big groups .
i agree with <UNK> ' s review .
their comics are also in poor condition .
they do n't take care of their comics .
you do n't need the repair plan .
you do n't need a second pair of glasses .
be prepared to walk away .
pros : i agree with others .
"their strengths are their kebab , humus and shwarma ."
do n't overcook your <UNK> balls .
it is extremely tough and tasteless 0 .
the kebab used to come out sizzling and tender .
as it turns out it was not .
their install crew was extremely careless .
it still is that way since july 0th .
it is now august 00 .
a couple weeks later and nothing .
the wine pairings with the tasting menu were fantastic .
the service was exquisite .
"the sauce , is good ."
"no greeter , host ."
help wanted printout on door .
"food was good , not great ."
bartender james was a very nice guy .
i tested each product independently .
"buy a tee shirt , support the fam ."
a very pleasant surprise .
he asked if the price was in my budget .
you failed to identify what i wanted .
let the building sell itself .
far worse than its been before .
i ' m forced to dispute the charge .
most shops seem sleepy and dirty .
best piano bar in town .
the service was simply awful .
i am not sure what has happened here .
the food was excellent .
but the service raised the experience even higher .
"friendly , courteous , knowledgable and smart ."
a great restaurant elevated by fantastic service .
keep up the great work guys !
beware about leaving your mower with jj
about $ 00 for a filling lunch .
she allowed me to enjoy the planning process .
great ingredients ... awesome staff .
they comped the check and made it right .
ordered a take-out large veggie .
good service quickly done .
but it is low priced and filling .
"good ribs , the brisket was fatty ."
the cornbread was very good .
the coleslaw was ok not anything special .
my wife ' s bbq chicken was good .
we found both and an excellent staff as well .
we could not have had a better visit .
the views could not be rivaled .
but overall it was the service that stood out .
pretty good food for a reasonable price .
do n't go for the hooters experience .
"this place is n't it ,"
this was a great place .
i would highly recommend .
"two by circus , variety show and absinthe ."
this show lacked any plot or humor .
the cost is higher than your normal benihana .
for the price i expected better food .
great service but the food was average at most .
this is an excellent place for lunch and dinner .
"clean and attractive dining area , clean bathrooms ."
"second , the food ."
would i recommend this place for the food ?
the fries come out fresh .
its been a continuous stream of problems since arriving .
first my room keys did n't work .
there are no menus in the rooms .
you must go see james !
we had the prime rib and the ribeye .
for the price point i expected more .
the attention to detail in every course was amazing .
a long island will run you $ 00 .
so that was a pleasant surprise .
the broth flavors tasted great .
all the food was well-stocked for the most part .
will certainly come back again next time .
the pizza here is mediocre .
- the beer has been flat at times !
i had the white gummy and they mai tai .
the one saving grace were the fried oreos .
i tried the tilapia enchiladas with mole sauce .
spend your money elsewhere .
music from kitchen is a little loud .
the karaoke singer guys is entertaining though .
i am a fan and will be back .
this was a pretty big turn off .
the lemonade is homemade and very good .
was here in october .
the wright bros <UNK> flying to riding a bike .
strongly advise bands to avoid this place .
"otherwise , the food was incredibly outstanding ."

even the ` ` <UNK> ' ' are terrific .
this place is awesome .
the food is just fantastic .
the drinks are also excellent .

0pm is when the dinner entrees come out .
the service was also very top notch .
the fried chicken did not disappoint .
they have a 0 story - lrb - ?
in n out is always honest and never <UNK> .
what is happening with the rio ?
i will say some good things still exists here .
the rooms have been advertised as recently renovated .
and it ' s spotty service at best .
and no more show in the sky ?
everyone has a place they stay at in vegas .
"either way , you are going to be happy ."
go for the surf and turf .
obviously now there is some competition !
the wine list was quite impressive as well .
but the double beat me .
the double was good and the chili rocked .
did i really lose ?
the <UNK> are always fun to visit with .
friendly staff and a great selection .
this place has nice decor and ambience .
service was also on point .
$ 00 for pho ? ? ? way overpriced .
i had breakfast there with family members .
the omelettes were ok but not outstanding .
they put exactly two small napkins in your bag .
they also do not take corporate coupons .
i then noticed the <UNK> .
the salads were not tasty and were poorly made .
the hand rolls had canned tuna in them .
"when i <UNK> myself , no one even <UNK> ."
"no alarms went off , nothing ."
the staff just does not care .
"actually , the range needs a remodel badly ."
"otherwise , it was n't all that bad ."
the staff is friendly and they know their products .
it is in a <UNK> and i legally carry .
they offer a wide range of services .
they act like they appreciate you on every transaction .
"for the positives : taste , looks and quantity ."
the two guys that greet customers are awesome .
i ordered a large pizza from them .
what more can i say about them ?
save your money and get pizza elsewhere .
stop reading this review and go there and eat .
everyone experienced the same thing .
the penne had <UNK> that was dry like jerky .
visited proof for a weekend breakfast for something new .

the <UNK> looks better than it actually tastes .
close to the strip .
there are plenty of food choices in the airport .
the assortment of food available was great .
everything else i had was good .
good location on the border of phoenix and scottsdale .
you wo n't be disappointed .
"the place is small , but clean ."
really fresh and really great flavors .
"my recommendation , try the carpaccio ."
no issues so far .
they do an ok job on the wash .
interior not all that great .
my wife and i had dinner here on 00/0 .
the decor on this location is kind of dated .
but the service was really the only drawback .
the food was quite good .
easily worst car wash in all of arizona .
it was very good .
everybody in our party liked what they ordered .
i would recommend montesano ' s .
took my parents and <UNK> there for thanksgiving .
the prices here are <UNK> high .
they started whining and left in a huff .
please give this local business a shot .
they have all kinds of pasta dishes as well .
still waiting for a legit bbq joint in <UNK> .
i ended up going with the ribs instead .
"thanks for the good experience , jeff !"
we have been here multiple times and always great .
great food and massive portions at reasonable prices .
top 0 steaks i ' ve ever ever had .
service is first class .
just an unbelievable dinner .
great guys that are focused on customer satisfaction .
"the price was reasonable , the service was prompt ."
my initial impression was mixed .
the grounds where well laced with dog crap .
talk about an amazing burger place .
pro : + amazing burgers .
how can you beat that ?
the other options were small and stale .
the crust is the best anywhere .
i have ate here twice .
the hotel and casino is clean and modern .
it ' s your typical jack in the box .
the patrons are friendly and the bartender is excellent .
the staff was courteous and friendly .
ok liquor store overall .
"clean , decent selection , and friendly staff ."
the place was also clean and well kept .
very good selection and great prices .

the customer service was friendly and everything was accurate .
the price was as quoted with no surprises .
"ok , nothing special ."
very nice <UNK> ' s .
great selection of clothing for big guys .
"ok , nothing spectacular ."
both mayonnaise dispensers were low or out of mayo .
the service was very slow as well .
it ' s usually in disarray and often understaffed .
great theater all around .
clean and located in a nice spot .
nothing more i could want from an ihop .
very friendly and laid back .
yet another great starbucks location .
a + standard issue chipotle .
i was here on a very busy saturday night .
i would stay away if i were you .
the classic sausage sandwich was fresh and hot .
the place was clean and well kept .
room was clean and staff was mostly friendly .
breakfast bar in the morning is nice .
overall a nice place .
this is hard to explain .
stay away from the wynn / encore .
you suck suncoast friday ' s ... you suck !
my porterhouse was cooked and seasoned perfectly .
it ' s your average kohls .
clean and well organized .
would shop here again .
not a very good wal mart .
would steer clear if i were you .
the little quiches and the dessert crepe were outstanding .
first spot i hit after hotel checkin .
ridiculous ! ! ! never going back .
needless to say my wife was very surprised .
great product and top notch service .
the decor is quite plain and nothing unique .
great place for watching any kind of sports .
my favorite burger place in charlotte .
absolutely the worst buffet ever .
this place is a great experience .
the live music on fridays totally blows .
"' ' fine , easy !"
great place for a friday happy hour !
update to come after installation .
they installed my gate four days later !
excellent tacos and salsa !
give ' em a try !
what a let down !
i separated my review on railroad pass into sections .
railroad pass is no bellagio .
it is not aiming for high rollers .
the parking lot is all surface .
"however , the iron rail cafe is a value ."
this value also influenced my rating .
halfway to the left is the heritage room .
there is insufficient literature on the rooms here .
the yelp 000 challenge review 00 of 000 .
the property is well-maintained .
the premises feature a car wash and complimentary <UNK> .
"when i yelp , i bark animal style ."
it is delicious fast food made simple .
but then again i always dine inside .
the interior is plain .
i do rate the pharmacy highly .
obviously it did not work .
"square tables , 0 ."
i have been in las vegas for ten years .
there are a few flaws to the supermarket .
the layout could be confusing to new shoppers .
this is a smaller smith ' s .
the parking lot is not the biggest either .
"additionally , saving on gas adds to the value ."
the produce along with the prices is good .
i never stick to one place to shop .
when i review small parks i am <UNK> .
* * * the 0000 yelp challenge .
"approximately $ 0 everyday , except major holidays ."
international craw fish fish rice pilaf 0 .
return factor : high vegas is sun city !
wetlands park <UNK> the las vegas wash . .
civil engineers have done the inevitable .
the administrative building is on my right .
this is where the wetlands park begins .
the hike starts off ordinary .
beyond the <UNK> is a hiking hub .
eventually the trails meet up with <UNK> road .
i call this the <UNK> south bank scenery .
leaves carpet the ground .
s . yelp 000 challenge review 00 .
anybody could enter the trail .
the wetlands park trail has been worth the wait .
they are one of the best deals in town .
i checked-in at the panda .
these days my opinion of the panda has changed .
this panda has a large <UNK> .
chicken with mushrooms was not my food of choice .
<UNK> park is an oasis in downtown las vegas .
the lake also included a <UNK> island for people .
the <UNK> is not a typical park building .
i only saw a couple of instances of <UNK> .
las vegas is referred to as the <UNK> island .
plus they will bus your table .
the restaurant interior with its sufficient seating is ordinary .
this time i experienced the mochiko chicken plate lunch .
i fill my cup with <UNK> <UNK> .
generally speaking i rate this chevron three stars .
understandably the new business has some flaws .
normally i would give it 0 stars .
what a culinary way to kick in 0000 .
this would stop me from discovering new places .
this is an interesting <UNK> .
this <UNK> is a melting pot of clientele .
what i saw more of was higher prices .
their fruity pancakes are the bomb .
still there were some flaws in the service .
everything i tried worked to no avail .
it sells dr . <UNK> ' s cat attract .
it has without doubt taken some of the business .
first off it is new .
petco has improved the layout .
the greenery attracts birds .
fitness stations are scattered throughout the trail .
this is likewise also named a healthy trail .
jogging is a popular activity here .
<UNK> is an uncommon activity here .
harkins theaters at arizona mills features stadium seating .
they are adjacent to a four star food court .
i conclude this review with a tip .
pei wei does not serve ordinary chinese food .
ordering was trial and error .
i was satisfied with the chicken pei wei .
a server will bring your food to your table .
the chicago mix is their signature item .
they make the popcorn fresh daily .
when vacation ended i lost a friend .
the sign said ` ` garrett popcorn coming soon .
' ' the separation lasted longer than i thought .
there is a short wait .
i loaded my plate with asian food .
"eating the asian food , it tasted familiar ."
every great city has its mellow spot .
san francisco has the twin peaks .
it is hidden off the beaten path .
this is the west wing bar .
it even has the classic arcade machines .
the furnishings include overly plush sofas with pillows .
"however , there is n't an abundance of beer ."
but they got the job done .
` ` have you never been mellow ?
olivia backed by her talented band performed 00 songs .
` ` have you never been mellow ?
' ' led off the 00 minute concert .
every band member contributed to the outstanding <UNK> .
fancy ross is n't .
so this will only be a quick review .
that is my arby ' s sandwich of choice .
thats all i have to say .
yelp challenge : review 00 of 000 .
there are a few long tables and two counters .
on both visits the chicken met my expectations .
a line was nonexistent .
the chicken was good but not great .
rei appeared to be the best option .
"<UNK> , pf was winning the battle ."
i am impressed by the selection of insoles .
they are a weapon against it .
there is a <UNK> or two .
that ' s enough about cool .
now i will review hot stuff .
and that is the caffeine beverages i ordered .
it was good but not darn good .
this is a nice cafe with an independent vibe .
it appears that refills are free .
it was for me on my three consecutive visits .
i said that starbucks is a corporate <UNK> .
the other side faces the counter .
"at the counter , the baristas were friendly ."
near the counter was a constant line .
this is the strip after all .
as i said starbucks is a <UNK> .
this view is lightning captured in a jar .
the landscape is <UNK> .
the scenery and aroma is wetlands .
it is an environment ideal for birds .
the <UNK> trail is currently a relatively short hike .
complimenting the food was bottomless cola .
ultimately they deliver the food for your dining adventure .
this has always been the case with metro pizza .
what ' s the worst that could of happened ?
napoli ' s has the coke freestyle machine .
the french fries were n't bad either .
napoli ' s is far more than pizza .
from that point forward the friendly waitress took over .
the quality was superb .
variety is the spice of life .
the shop is relatively small .
i have had zero issues getting a table .
that person also cooks the sandwiches and cafe food .
yelp challenge review 00 of 000 .
airports are very important .
"like las vegas , mccarran is modern ."
the list of fast food restaurants keep growing .
return factor : i ' ll probably return .
the parks revolution has reached the las vegas valley .
it is a revolution of peace and recreation .
the enemy of the parks revolution are <UNK> .
i observed zero security personal .
but the coffee needs improvement .
especially from finishing the meal to the check .
"but in the village , people are not rushed ."
the chicken <UNK> was a good choice .
overall jamie is a good bartender .
it was a similar experience to the 00th .
there is a <UNK> culture that permeates the place .
and that is if there is no competition .
the las vegas strip is the adult disney land .
the interior is <UNK> and everything is new .
and the store was organized and clean .
it is halfway between home and work .
after work i appreciate convenience .
what great clips is is great value .
twelve dollars buys a nice haircut .
value extends to beard trims and <UNK> .
the service and quality of haircuts equal 0.0 stars .
hidden falls park is off us 00 exit 00 .
horizon drive continues into the park .
all the park amenities are off horizon drive .
"<UNK> south , there is open land ."
directly ahead is black mountain .
black mountain stands in its glory .
the <UNK> trail continues from where horizon drive <UNK> .
the wait was less than five minutes .
the food is also delicious .
the chicken parmesan sandwich is unique .
i enjoyed every bite of the chicken parmesan sandwich .
the $ 0 difference is the puny dessert .
three meatballs <UNK> the <UNK> .
maybe this is why the spaghetti lacked flavor .
my final verdict : promenade cafe 0 stars .
in reality i ended 0000 on a high summit .
lone mountain would be my ultimate hike of 0000 .
this is one exit where nature dominates .
especially when i am climbing up a mountain .
lone mountain is no joke .
vegetation is relatively nonexistent on lone mountain .
i give lone mountain 0 stars .
the price is fair .
they say that variety is the spice of life .
the spicy drunken noodles remind me of chow fun .
this got the most action on my plate .
what should i try ?
my brother took advantage of this deal .
"in yelp ratings , the middle is 0 stars ."
i was satisfied with a sesame bagel .
starbuck ' s is a lively third place .
it has some serious competition .
their bagels are far superior to starbuck ' s .
i have had to park by walgreen ' s .
i was in boulder station bound for feast buffet .
so were hundreds of other people .
i was very satisfied .
they were served with both mozzarella and ranch sauces .
the portions were both quality and quantity .
it is whitney mesa recreation area .
the whitney mesa recreation area exceeded my first impression .
the spaces are few and the parking stalls small .
there are three major overlooks .
the path passes along molten rock and <UNK> .
review 00 of 000 .
china a go go was the winning choice .
not every location is identical .
i ordered the shrimp chop suey luncheon special .
but it is nothing like wonton soup .
the fried rice was tasty filler food .
"coming off the long hike , i was thirsty ."
in lake las vegas there are not many choices .
with its sunny climate vegas is sun city .
this would be <UNK> canyon .
this is roughly the center of the park .
graffiti is relatively nonexistent .
this gives a perception of safety and police presence .
"unlike disneyland , real animals replace robotic animals ."
i ' d pass several dog owners .
it is encouragement through a 0 star rating .
the las vegas landscape is full of doughnut shops .
throughout the room the tables are plentiful and comfortable .
in my opinion they are a better product .
dunkin donuts coffee lives up to its name .
friendly characters star on the krispy kreme stage .
there is no stadium seating .
i recommend the australian bee gees .
they will save you a good amount of money .
java vegas is more than coffee .
the luncheon specials are a good deal .
the lunch special features an entree .
i ordered the shrimp chow mein luncheon special .
regardless they went good with the spicy mustard .
the quality was magnificent .
this is an example of both quantity and quality .
the landscaping is candy to the eyes .
the trail is paved and relatively flat .
homes border the park .
tunnels eliminate the automobile and pedestrian conflict .
"but , why sweat over the small stuff ?"
this was a long line that moved fast .
this was my first impression of sharp management .
"after paying , he presented me with a <UNK> ."
the cost was nearly double than in n out .
i hear the shakes are phenomenal .
is shake shack the new york in n out ?
unfortunately nothing about it is grand .
attention to beverage refills was slow .
in the center of the library are the computers .
it is owned and managed by von ' s .
or i might be relaxed and want a coffee .
the shops are middle to high range .
"so here is review # 0,000 on the bellagio ."
the beds are superb .
usually the price is exorbitant .
it passes right by the luxor .
is n't las vegas a 00/0 town ?
the <UNK> passes ordinary scenery .
if i could be elevated from daniel .
here are some comparisons that i made .
and i now have a compatible yelping assistant .
a flaw is there are no tables inside .
there is seating close by outside rubio ' s .
the great customer service is n't an issue .
this certainly <UNK> into my review .
this type of pretzel is not prepared hot .
still my taste buds rate it good .
they serve it in a styrofoam cup .
inside this attractive restaurant are friendly servers .
they were on the 0 ball .
carnegie deli has a long history .
with the sandwiches are pickles .
<UNK> park is canine friendly .
the landscape is mostly <UNK> desert vegetation .
at the entrance is the menu .
the woman greeter nicely directed us upstairs .
i was in a budget state of mind .
most likely i will return to bubba gump .
emerald island is also the cheers of casinos .
it was 0 stars .
i give a shout out to my waitress rosie .
she ' d be an outstanding yelper .
not a bad restaurant .
and not a great restaurant .
the server was friendly and attentive to beverage refills .
hard to catch the fine print cruising on tropicana .
the fries were tasty .
the waitress was on top of beverage refills .
fries are included in the price of the sandwich .
there are countless starbuck ' s on the strip .
inside the starbuck ' s is modern .
there are plenty of seating .
the taste and quality are commendable .
new york pizza that i grew up on .
the people that recommended grimaldi ' s were right .
the answer is employee enthusiasm .
attitude could make or break my ratings .
let ' s try it .
over the years the menu must of changed .
two of the three types of shrimp were breaded .
now the stuffed crab shrimp was delicious .
dining out is precious .
"the place is huge , which <UNK> wait times ."
"maybe , the deserts could be better ."
the live asian station serves fantastic won ton soup .
all in all the food tasted good .
the server was on top of refills .
and it costs around $ 00 .
the casino is one rectangle .
the highest price is $ 0.00 .
at the rainbow quantity equals quality .
the place comes alive during the nfl games .
this starbuck ' s was a good choice .
recently they built the st . rose parkway trail .
this very trail is more than freshly poured pavement .
two <UNK> that replenished my thirst .
throughout the trail there are pockets of mini <UNK> .
i have to bring up some constructive criticism .
in smart style i met the samurai hairstylist .
from there the samurai hairstylist barely talked to me .
"fortunately , the samurai hairstylist does have talent ."
green valley ranch is a hot spot of bars .
i used to be a fan of panda express .
this is a drive-thru equipped starbuck ' s .
threw is sufficient parking .
i usually park by the smog station .
some are meet up locations .
this is the <UNK> starbuck ' s .
the <UNK> certainly are n't <UNK> against customer service .
"today , i decided to try it ."
mediocre service went hand in hand with the presentation .
that car wash attendant is you .
i place the hose setting to low pressure wash .
howard <UNK> gets a lot of mention here .
security would be a wise investment .
wildfire casino is the mini station casino .
further up is the happening bar .
toward the back is the wildfire burger cafe .
lady luck had not been in the house .
additionally wildfire serves barley ' s beer .
and in my opinion it looks like filler .
the feast buffet has been unpredictable .
ralph and bud were <UNK> .
"in 0000 , <UNK> became an <UNK> company ."
<UNK> became involved in their company .
it is something that i accept to get value .
i can not pay by credit card .
overhead music is the pipes and fans .
"again , this goes to saving money ."
the people drive a distance to <UNK> at winco .
a couple of examples .
winco is a winning company for food value .
i rate this winco a winning four stars .
the restaurants are upscale with decent prices .
i enjoyed having lunch in grand lux cafe .
the best way to describe it is elegant .
this is the time to pay for a request .
and secondary library branch for that matter .
the drug and alcohol <UNK> is the constant exhibit .
the restrooms are repulsive .
the incapable security guards are totally <UNK> .
delicious adult beverages that include the blue hawaiian .
if they only knew how good they are .
and that is even before drinking a tiki <UNK> .
the drinks here are potent .
i made an agreement to stick to one drink .
on the way back i would use a taxi .
this route also serves the <UNK> transfer station .
lone mountain discovery park <UNK> lone mountain .
this park is a gateway to lone mountain hiking .
thanks to tix 0tonight we got a major discount .
"from kansas , <UNK> arrives ."
he invites the <UNK> group arsenal to perform .
<UNK> <UNK> is the quintessential bad boy .
things happen again between <UNK> and <UNK> .
<UNK> with the story line are jokes .
the main stage set is the bourbon room .
there is a scene in the venus strip club .
there are other scenes using the bourbon room set .
the acting is first-rate .
the high energy level is contagious .
the performers will occasionally break out of character .
"near the theater , they built the bourbon lounge ."
i turned to yelp ' s <UNK> category .
' ' ` ` did you have a stroke ?
now the tears are being replaced by anger .
did i break a bone ?
the beat coffeehouse is an awesome coffeehouse scene .
a few more feet are the seats .
management has good taste in music .
the ushers were friendly .
i ' m spending 0 hours with shania twain .
i did not need a beer .
then she is on a motorcycle .
the set takes on a <UNK> motif .
' ' shania exits through a red door .
shania rides in on a white horse .
shania performs ` ` from this moment .
flashy guitars are blasting .
<UNK> appears in large <UNK> has become a rocker .
"with the newness , there is some neat features ."
i am a fan of new businesses .
good move in a recession .
after two meals there i was impressed .
in the <UNK> there are couple of bear statues .
"inside the diner , the bear motif is prevalent ."
i selected the meat loaf diner .
i went with the mashed potatoes with gravy .
the abundant portion <UNK> quantity and quality .
black bear diner is down the street from me .
this secret special has been around for years .
the steak ranges from average to good .
in vegas this is a value .
recently they added to their chinese food selection .
vegas is sun city .
it is a park with two sections .
the trails are dirt and gravel .
i learned there are two trails up <UNK> mountain .
this is 0 star picture material .
exploring both trails will extend your hiking experience .
a security presence increases <UNK> quality of life .
security <UNK> the park on foot and bike .
will i return to exploration park ?
ballys best feature is its location .
caesars palace is <UNK> across the street .
anybody could walk onto a south tower elevator .
and there ar no resort fees .
this 0 star rating is my tribute to ron .
his pictures showed an <UNK> for nature and wildlife .
ron did too good of a job with <UNK> .
with <UNK> came some <UNK> .
drama was replaced by <UNK> .
i also developed yelp <UNK> with <UNK> .
his personal friendship lives on .
i am a borderline smartphone addict .
it is a condition affecting 00 percent of americans .
it is a smart concept .
everything at the verizon store is inflated .
i am a borderline smartphone addict that is respectful .
durango drive was built about thirty years later .
this looks exactly like a 00 ' s diner .
the red dominates the booths and chairs .
breakfast is a major part of its business .
the omelet house influence permeates the menu .
the food was good for the money .
it was served on toasted bread with a tomato .
it was a good sandwich .
the refrigerated beer selection is satisfactory .
my beer of choice is the 00 ounce michelob .
it is your responsibility to have the bottle opener .
review 00 out of 000 .
there are two dining rooms .
the waitress was friendly .
"' ' well , maybe not the greatest ."
i am still trying chinese restaurants throughout the valley .
on a serious note .
it is an ok bank .
i consider dylan ' s a classic rock bar .
rocking tunes makes gambling in moderation fun .
this restaurant gets significant sunlight .
and it gets busy .
it was an effort to order a whopper .
ordering a whopper would no longer require thinking .
i was bound for the old mormon fort .
the service was mediocre at best .
the stations themselves are commendable .
but the selection is lacking .
the most obvious example is the soup selection .
the small selection extended to the ice cream selection .
i do not recall seeing gelato .
i give kudos to some of the live stations .
this is a small starbuck ' s .
and the starbucks radio plays at the right volume .
"due to good management , the lines move fast ."
i follow the yellow <UNK> road .
the show room is decent size .
' ' * first-rate performance on <UNK> two material .
* great horn solo on ` ` urgent .
* overall first-rate <UNK> and entertainment .
* i love classic rock * and inexpensive beer .
it is the <UNK> .
the <UNK> canyon national conservation area was born .
in my opinion the parking is <UNK> .
the trail gradually <UNK> elevation with soft curves .
"it reaches 0,000 feet west of mile marker 0 ."
it is an eight mile hike .
there are mile posts that include emergency phone numbers .
the scenery is worthy of academy award recognition .
<UNK> review 00 of 000 .
this might draw you closer to the restaurant .
y addressed brown rice is nonexistent here .
the <UNK> was good stuff .
i am a fan of the old school casinos .
the longhorn is a down to earth casino .
the new york bagel shops never served premium coffee .
this one is not an exception .
einstein has new york beat on coffee .
there is sufficient seating in new york bagels .
i will state my minor complaints slash constructive criticism .
this is like having a hamburger without fries .
there are picnic tables and shelters .
and the facilities are in top shape .
nice homes surround it .
* source : city of henderson website .
my experience here puts an answer to that question .
you could be sitting here a long time .
another minor complaint i have are the booths .
and there was zero 00 ounce beer .
on both visits i was satisfied with the food .
the food was decent .
shake shack has been consistent with quality .
it seems that las vegans including yours truly daniel .
yelping is about sharing cool places .
maybe i am exaggerating but the prices are high .
"being a local , the restaurant is familiar ."
the waiter took my order .
johnny rocket ' s menu focuses on burgers .
the fries were average .
- rrb - started around $ 0 .
the challenge level depends on how sober you are .
on account of size constraints there is one course .
this can impact the rate of return play .
it only took us 00 minutes to <UNK> .
kiss mini golf is more than 00 holes .
vegas needs a decent miniature golf course .
coincidentally the hard rock hotel is across the street .
it is the quintessential scene from a stress-free zone .
the service has improved .
a coworker recommended jason ' s deli .
this jason ' s deli is enormous .
it sits at a higher elevation .
"furthermore , there is plenty of seating ."
the <UNK> is dunkin donuts version of the <UNK> .
in my opinion it is better .
it is a partnership that resulted in the <UNK> .
this tranquil place is the flamingo wildlife habitat .
the flamingo habitat is my garden on the strip .
the flamingo habitat claims to have 000 birds .
they even have a <UNK> checklist .
things have taken a turn for the better .
and it is 0 stars .
kind of how my brother and i also felt .
nothing about brown or fried rice .
i did n't read the fortune cookie .
the six sets of tables never fill up .
the piped in oldies is enjoyable to listen to .
generally speaking the food selection here stinks .
my seat of choice overlooked the hallway .
the arizona mills starbucks is a welcoming place .
there is usually a delay between ordering and pickup .
and a diet coke and regular coke .
my dad texted him and no response .
this kind of service is killing nathan ' s .
the grand china lunch special is a hot deal .
the hot and sour soup was hot and delicious .
the soup was the strong point of the lunch .
a saving of $ 0 a day adds up .
"the answer is , ` ` no ."
not everybody is computer savvy .
i should n't complain that one counter was open .
' ' misery seems contagious here .
' ' this brings up another issue .
everything from the meat to the onions tasted fresh .
the fries are also good .
freddy ' s fries are the skinny style .
the ultimate customer service occurred tonight .
i never saw this at a mcdonald ' s .
the staff is fast .
freddy ' s is the rising star .
what ' s the best beer ?
barley ' s attraction is its microbrewery .
today station casinos owns barley ' s .
gaming is fun in barley ' s .
$ 0 drafts are the stars of happy hour .
<UNK> is the galaxy theaters .
nearby are some decent restaurants including olive garden .
there is a smith ' s .
three months ahead of christmas there was a surprise .
a nightclub is as good as the entertainment .
"as far as bars go , it is decent ."
i rate yellow brick road four stars .
this china a go go is a familiar storefront .
the styrofoam box of chinese food was good .
the location is convenient to mandalay bay guests .
good place for people watching .
one is playing <UNK> and fox .
not worth a special trip .
"focusing on the mcdonalds , it is usually busy ."
but the lines move fast .
there is a high chance of me returning here .
this review is broken into categories .
imagine if it was busy .
there is zero wifi promotions .
yelp is real reviews by real people .
most likely that will never happen .
the noise level is average .
saguaro park is a nice community park .
this is a relatively small starbuck ' s .
it does have a drive-thru .
i had never planned to visit brass lounge .
it is the brass lounge .
my first impression is that it is upbeat .
the service was decent .
from what i remember it tasted good .
the service was sporadic .
actually this review is overdue .
in name this location is a starbuck ' s .
there are less pastries than the corporate owned stores .
i entered through modern electric sliding doors .
the workers were on top of their game .
the interior is more contemporary than mcdonald land .
the mcdonald <UNK> is nonexistent .
mcdonald ' s may not be 0 star dining .
the von ' s is very clean .
the interior is upbeat .
and this von ' s attracts a good <UNK> .
this is a vegetable and cabbage based chow mein .
i pat extra for bottomless coke .
buying the phone is $ 000 cheaper at walmart .
best buy is not the best buy .
there was sufficient sales help on the floor .
stay tuned for a future best buy review .
the procedure seemed to take less than five minutes .
this is usually before a hike .
and the best thing for hiking is bottled water .
the sign is by subway .
and that if its even legal .
review 00 of 000 .
the red booths resemble the new york pizzaria .
the scent of baking pizza permeates the small restaurant .

minor league baseball is more than a game .
"during the game , fans do the stretch ."
security made sure they were empty .
it is just your basic ball park snack bar .
i must state that draft beer has gone up .
the result is a high noise level .
yellow brick road is not a road .
club madrid is both a club and bar .
even a server was singing along .
your records are like bottles of fine wine .

the purpose of my visit was new hiking boots .

the difficult decision was where to buy hiking boots .
then i recalled norm .

"however , it was quality over quantity ."
the hiking boots and prices were remarkable .
the hollywood theatre is a small and intimate room .
- rrb - to pick a number .

it is hyper jumping .
and adjacent to a fitness center .
the cheesesteak special was delicious .
i am a coffee drinker and regularly patronize starbucks .
the store could use their employees more efficiently .
this albertsons could use a remodel .
the summerlin and college road albertsons are examples .
the vegas strip is a grown up disney land .
unfortunately this location falls far short on sufficient seating .
the ice cream was delicious .
the steak house is in <UNK> .
she did have a valid point .
it is the <UNK> of <UNK> .
the lighting was just right .
the dã © cor was extraordinary elegant .

my taste buds greatly enjoyed it .
i leave the cafe more relaxed .
the park was big enough .

it was 00 minutes of amazement .
the young man started out as a <UNK> .
one word describes the terry fator show : amazing .
the puppets were <UNK> funny with great pipes .
terry fator was the voice of the puppets .
this does bring up a slight issue .
terry ' s puppets are an entertaining supporting cast .
the show starts off with winston the turtle .
he yells out that he has had four <UNK> .
there is no intermission in the show .
this ought to be one of my shortest reviews .
' ' this review describes the experience .
i have been flying with southwest airlines for years .
fast forward to the flights from midway .
my dad ' s flight got delayed three hours .
the cause was a mechanical problem .
lining up to board the airplane is a hassle .
unfortunately the humorous flight crews are being utilized less .
their jokes <UNK> a tense environment .
there is an issue .
the bar tender was also a waiter .
the result was a wait for the tequila .
it brings the old school casino prices to summerlin .
i am a fan of the casino cafe .
but to me it was a no brainer .
bottomless cola added $ 0.00 to the price .
the chicken parmesan was also good .
"but , it was a large plate ."
i ordered shrimp chow fun with bottomless coke .
this is my review .
it is broken into sections .
sleep inn wanted around $ 000 .
amenities sleep inn ' s greatest amenity is larry .
the hotel includes a continental breakfast .
and you do not need a designated driver .
the hotel itself was well managed and clean .
i recommend it through yelp .
paradise road has the bavarian beer hall .
beer drinkers share good times at long tables .
$ 0.00 also pays for a strong beer .
hofbrauhaus is more than beer .
i will be honest .
i am a sensitive guy that adores animals .
it is going to be an exotic petting zoo .
the other star was a <UNK> .
the <UNK> was full of life .
this was a hot july afternoon .
and it can get hot in a trailer .
s 0000 yelp 000 challenge review 00 .
but the meatloaf was the bomb .
the quality and quantity satisfied my expectations .

including the flamingo cafe .
raising canes raises fast food to a new level .
i walked into raising canes .
the caniac combo is overflowing with food .
the plate is overflowing with fries .
the chicken fingers appear larger than kfc chicken legs .
"on my visit , there was one glitch ."
sometimes the best things in life are free .
tree top park is free admission well spent .
not every starbuck ' s is identical .
this is the area where starbuck ' s is .
there is sufficient shade and tables .
the main sound is the birds chirping away .
i believe that a venti frap exceeds $ 0 .
bottle water exceeds $ 0 .
i have been to del taco in the past .
in my opinion their cheeseburger is tasty .
online courses are available .
next i was filling out the simple paperwork .
i was never isolated from the outside world .
steve leads the class through videos and reading materials .
it is usually a four hour class .
this means i will not be a duke here .
the cola is not flat .
review 00 of 000 .
and their super cheeseburger is greatly underrated .
service has never been nathan ' s strong point .
the prices here are reasonable .
nathan ' s food is greatly underrated .

the gatorade is $ 0 .
their cold beverages are a <UNK> .
a canyon dominates the landscape .
rushing water is rare in the desert .
the wetlands trail hike requires some <UNK> .
the parking lot is busy .
firehouse was started by real <UNK> .

firehouse is one of the better sub chains .
it has been a unique relationship .
that is a sign of charisma .
big elvis ought to be called big charisma .
there are countless elvis <UNK> <UNK> .
that is 000 pounds lost .
the sun studios dueling guitar set is gone .
' ' people will find it entertaining or corny .
i recommend seeing the big elvis show .
admission is a $ 0 beer .
all at fair prices .
the larger <UNK> is on the lower level .
all these businesses add up to traffic .

they did give a fair amount of shrimp .
in my opinion little dumpling is an okay dumpling .
this is one more positive panda express experience .
the design <UNK> a large number of balcony seats .
what happens in vegas stays in vegas .
the attention to detail is commendable .
the star attraction is the live shark tank .
the signing is replaced by audio .
it ' s a nice break from constant reading .
<UNK> mountain is the beast of vegas hiking trails .
"this is a height above the 0,000 feet stratosphere ."
life is about the experiences .
lolo ' s displays them in two spots .
the prime spot faces the walkway .
i hope it survives .
and i left satisfied .
this adds to the family-friendly environment .
the only place to park is on venetian <UNK> .
"in this day , that is a bargain ."
i recommend dunkin donuts .
this review will also discuss them .
he brought the fort to first base .
they brought the fort to second base .
then the railroad and bureau of <UNK> owned it .
they brought the fort to third base .
when i <UNK> a fort it is the <UNK> .

my mind was set on fish and chips .

diamond china 0 is a rectangular shaped restaurant .
the rectangle is divided into two rooms .
this is a full service restaurant .
this is an older mcdonald ' s .
there is no theme .
the coke was flat .
the beer and nachos are inexpensive .
"i correct myself , the beer is a bargain ."
lately i have been one of them .
the <UNK> fans get really into it .
especially from the fans that think it is real .
food is a big part of it .
their laser show is first-rate .
i enjoy playing caveman keno on their <UNK> machines .
in daylight the <UNK> seats are the prime seats .
i expected a full service restaurant .
i was still undecided .
it is their hangover burger .
should i order the burger or the ruben .
"the answer was , ` ` yes ."
the friendly staff would consistently checkup on us .
here are my constructive criticism points .
the price is to high for what you get .
the hangover burger with fries is $ 00 .
just a little overpriced .
i just had supper here .
this panda express did not let me down .
so far it has not let me down .
there would be a 00 minute wait .
i am a fan of brisket and mushrooms .
delicious smoked beef brisket that is .

there are at least twelve ponds .
there are <UNK> for viewing the birds unnoticed .
"they include <UNK> , coyotes - lsb - wow !"
in the distance over wetlands park stands <UNK> mountain .
' ' fuku burger is really lucky burger .
they are either inside or outside .
at least on yelp .
after long hikes their cold beverages are welcoming .
there are too many people <UNK> too few seats .
plus the lines are frequently lengthy .
the food is the normal panda express .
regardless all <UNK> are expensive on the strip .
it is big on fun and small on price .
"throughout <UNK> on paradise , tvs show sports ."
<UNK> ties in sports with beer and food specials .
their $ 0.00 price for beer is reasonable .
their $ 0 beer special is sensational .
the british pub theme rocks .
china go go does not splurge on their portions .
$ 0.00 and $ 0.00 for shrimp based entries .
this is the typical china go go experience .
no <UNK> on quality here .
return factor : high .
there is only a stop sign .
plus they have seattle ' s best .
in my eyes dunkin donuts is dunkin bagels .
since then some dunkin donuts have folded .
return factor : high .
a one star <UNK> from my past review .
the ticket counter <UNK> is nonexistent .
a bit pricey but you live once .
the downtown summerlin panda express had filled me up .
the theater brought comfort up to the next galaxy .
this was stadium seating on steroids .
my library card registration needed renewal .
all the <UNK> are featured under the individual categories .
the sahara west library collection of cds is substantial .
this gets me on fire .
i ordered the firehouse hero .
the hero was warm and filled with substance .
yesterday was one of my few bad experiences here .
this experience started off promising .
i tend to disagree .
ditto for the meatloaf .
celery spoiled the taste of the rice pilaf .
regardless i ' d fill up on miso soup .
my relationship with <UNK> has become <UNK> and unpredictable .
"the way i see it , you live once ."
i expected a three to four star experience .
the service is average .
a grand price for mediocre food .
the service was decent .
nothing grand and nothing negative .
the trail surface is rocky and <UNK> .
there is an entry marker warning of <UNK> .
take in n out burger .
they have turned dining out into a simple experience .
in n out burgers taste freshly made .
the cannery failed at that .
the restaurant met my standards in <UNK> .
this is a <UNK> that can handle the volume .
both specials are $ 0.00 before a beverage .
this brought down the pepper steak and lo mein .
likes : good value .
only white rice comes with the lunch special .
my taste buds are indifferent to celebrity chefs .
something is fishy about this mcdonalds .
this is no ordinary aquarium .
children seemed amazed by the fish .
palace station is the exception .
now let ' s talk about outrageous prices .
talk about two awesome <UNK> .
it is urban planning as good as it gets .
throughout the trail there are decorative shade stations .
it is still awesome .
being adventurous i tried grits .
this is a two line process .
the sights and sounds of the casino is exciting .
i was the sole bar patron .
his catch phrase was ` ` no worries .
i was only having one beer .
wednesday is gamer night .
friday is live music night .
<UNK> has an advantage over its competition .
the public check-ins are outstanding advertisements for a business .
then what fast food place is n't these days .
the <UNK> dinner has been a personal tradition .
it was a logical choice .
but not these streets of new york .
maybe this is first-rate new york pizza .
this is how it works .
the lunch and dinner menus feature whopper sandwiches .
i am hooked and keep wanting to return .
at raising canes you are not a number .
the combos are abundant in quantity and quality .
my favorite is the caniac combo .
"kind of tastes like 0,000 island ."
* coleslaw ... very good .
raising canes is raising the standard of fast food .
where ' s the beef ?
' ' in this case the beef was beacon .
this is my second time at this panera bread .
and there is sufficient seating and lighting .
when your done they bus the table .
a blt gives me an impression of a restaurant .
i could return to panera bread .
"in new york , we miss arby ' s ."
i decided to try a drip coffee with syrup .
the majority are relatively up to date .
complimenting a decent library is a decent staff .
i ordered a toasted blueberry bagel with salmon <UNK> .
when i shopped here the place was very clean .
there is a total photo and us bank .
this <UNK> fell short of my expectation .
my <UNK> ' s <UNK> check-ins stop here .
convenience stores are a dime a dozen .
i am a fan of new york chinese restaurant .
my complaint was too much celery .
i am a fan of new york chinese restaurant .
a major reason is the restaurants .
i especially enjoyed the feast buffet .
lately station casinos reduced their prices on buffets .
i recommend the feast buffet at boulder station .
dining here was a laid back experience .
' ' overall bangkok orchid is a good restaurant .
i appreciate las vegas shows .
it is easy to see what shows are playing .
that person also controls the traffic in the room .
its kind of a two step show purchasing process .
it was in yelp friend <UNK> .
it is not a stand alone chinese restaurant .
the lunch specials are a fantastic deal .
the shrimp based entrees are the highest priced ones .
it is a take out atmosphere with sufficient seating .
the fried rice was of good quality .
china wan wan is china win win .
this chow mien is vegetable instead of noodle based .
it works like this .
near the counter is the coke machine .
you serve yourself as often as you want .
i feel that this service deserves a dollar tip .
it is now and <UNK> .
s has reviewed it .
it does a good job at this .
"in the summer , jimmy <UNK> jr . ."
park features night time movies .
i am impressed with jimmy <UNK> jr . .
the $ 0 slice is a fantastic deal .
the interior <UNK> new york city .
one thing is certain .
shopping here has <UNK> and advantages .
these are the <UNK> .
the interior is bland .
the store is not the cleanest .
these are the advantages .
there is a good selection at great prices .
' ' i would become an <UNK> yelper .
yelp challenge review 00 of 000 .
it all comes down to the money .
this review is just one man ' s opinion .
however my wallet does n't .
i enjoy the coney island theme and dining environment .
it is a separate combination dish .
he recommends the barbecue spare ribs .
the bagel was 0.00 star good .
first i ' ll talk about the gardens .
sitting here was a five star aroma therapy session .
"when i shop , the <UNK> experience is important ."
this smith ' s is in a convenient location .
"and at night , parking is convenient ."
the street lighting is kind of din .
my check-ins here will most likely continue .
coffee bean is obviously doing something right .
in 0000 coffee bean continues to brew good coffee .
forget about a laptop and coffee with some space .
i support good coffee shops .
this starbucks also includes a drive thru .
the cafe is on the roomy side .
the egg <UNK> beverages are likewise delicious .
the orleans is the best of both worlds .
for the record they never checked .
the <UNK> ' s has good dining options .
this is a casino with cool bars .
there is <UNK> ' s irish pub .
near the main entrance is the bourbon lounge .
one night a country act played here .
all this stuff costs money .
my game of choice is caveman keno .
i slept very well on the soft bed .
i am a fan of the theme casinos .
the casinos that overdo it with <UNK> are blah .
it is a regional mall worthy of four stars .
the <UNK> layout is very easy to navigate .
i give arizona mills four stars .
i was doing as much drinking as looking .
i ordered a drip coffee with white chocolate powder .
this is a well managed coffee bean .
"in panda style , the service was good ."
"from ordering to paying , i was treated decently ."
on the other hand verizon provided bad service .
some locations are more affected than others .
this location is moderately affected by this flaw .
there is sufficient seating throughout the store .
the lunch special tops off at $ 0.00 .
this review is long overdue .
there is over and above sports facilities .

"thus , i shall not be going back ."
"great bbq , and decent service ."

"they were , in a single word , outstanding ."
i will certainly return here many times .
who cares if it looks dated .

. i ' ll be back time after time .
my personal favorite is blt burger .
it ' s the second happiest place on earth .
this had both advantages and <UNK> .

homemade ketchup was fantastic .
especially when it ' s going to be expensive .
service was very good .
"friendly , friendly staff ."

the fried egg sandwich and blt were awesome .
want to have wifi and a gym ?
$ 00 a night .
the staff was completely incompetent .
you ca n't miss bringing your car here .
give it a try and you will not regret .
after that the game works almost fine .
i ca n't rave about spinato ' s enough .
stay away from these guys .
the vip host staff can not be trusted .
this is obviously totally unacceptable .
and this is how they treat me ?
you should be absolutely ashamed of yourselves .
just be ready to haggle prices .
plus the female screeching has got to go .
most of the music is amateur and forgettable .
both were absolutely excellent .
pep had great sauce .
"no thanks , i ' ll stick to yogurtland ."
the best dessert value in las vegas !
absolutely first rate service at this place .
it is a great dining experience .
go for a shake if nothing else .

green chile sauce makes it more than worthwhile .
dessert was another great creation .
the waiter recommended it .
the staff was more than friendly throughout the evening .
the caesar ' s salad was good .
the short ribs were decent .
that dish absolutely rocked .
i arrive at a 0000 pio <UNK> <UNK> .

"in this day and age , <UNK> ."
com is the great <UNK> for the consumer .
the grape was <UNK> <UNK> .
"the entree was good , not great ."
one of the flavors was mocha porter .
i paired it with a <UNK> wine .
it does n't get any better .
this place does not live up to the hype .
"the doughnut dessert was awesome , though ."
the short rib dish was outstanding .
the wine could use a bit of work .
we had no chance to try desert .
i would say that this place is very dependable .
it is a real phoenix institution .
long live the 0 & diner .
loved the fried chicken and waffle dish .
is a very creative interpretation of the timeless classic .
"service was top notch all the way , also ."
make sure to get a flatbread dish .
i paired my meal with a spanish <UNK> wine .

"also , i strongly recommend ordering a <UNK> ."
why does he keep calling him my friend ?
i am a fan of hooters .
"simply put , the best gelato in arizona ."
i frequent houston ' s for dinner .
houston ' s has an innovative approach to service .
do not be offended if you see multiple servers .
it boasts extremely americanized asian food .
i would avoid large groups .
<UNK> is what i call a hybrid restaurant .
it is very low maintenance and quick .
this is how i feel about pete ' s .
the food is great .
"part ketchup , part hot sauce ."
"also , a haircut averages about $ 00 ."
the food seemed fairly common and nothing stuck out .
the food is well worth the wait .
a pair of jeans and a polo is fine .
one of our favorite restaurants in charlotte .
"service always good , food always excellent ."
jose did a great job .
on time and on budget .
no casino and no smoking .

i really enjoy the food at native .
"apart from that , prepare to be upset ."
"great coffee , great food , great people ."
what else could you ask for ?
we could n't even fill out our own contracts .

the sauce is just so damn good .
subs here so far are excellent .
i ' m a fan ' ' .
it ' s an upscale trendy burger joint .
little local hole in the wall with great food .

pretty tough reviews but this was my first visit .
. so win win .
but good place to hang at night .
that ' s not a bad thing .
my recommendation is that you try it out .
the waiter just dropped it off and bailed .
the girl said her burger was good .
and i did very much enjoy her fries .
normal or spicy chicken is my pick .
the staff is very friendly and always attentive .
. though i doubt it differs many days .
as in modern and clean .
"prices are fine , what i expected ."
standard rolls were just that ... standard .
my friend says the <UNK> is pretty great tho .
so why review it ?
. many they ' re kinda friendly there .
excellent take-out and ordering .
i felt like an idiot .
i ate ... got my wallet and drove back .
that ' s a win in my book folks .
not many people out past 0pm .
also the automated billing never worked .
so i set it to do manual payments online .
it is what it is .
little slow at lunch but they seemed understaffed .
very good no complaints at all .
i say get down here and try it out .
0 of 0 best gyros in az . .
very nice location btw ... good <UNK> .
nothing bad to say at all .
they ' ll have to figure that out .
you can see my problem .
went here for a lunch meeting suggestion .
but overall pricing is fair and normal .

i mean it happens ?
i ' ll be back .
anyways - check it out - good stuff .

the guy at the counter had plastic gloves on .
should have at least two people at the counter .
"and yes , the gelato is very good ."
well here ' s the thing .
the layout is clean and simple .
could n't agree more with the majority of reviews .
this is phoenix arizona .
"not bangkok or chang mai , thailand ."
and i ' ll be honest .
same with indian food .
the indian food in london is stellar .
a really special blend of different regional fares .
it seemed pretty ordinary .
the service and selection is excellent .

i would definitely recommend them any automotive service work .
food quality and customer service are both below average .

this month was disney themed .
this place reeks of a <UNK> era in vegas .
two words : chef ' s table .
three more words : chilled seafood platter .
this place is fantastic .
i can not recommend this place highly enough .
mexican and chinese street food both done well .
it is my meal of choice in this city .
the only ding was the wait .
' ' no traffic school .
"the service was good , but very slow ."
this one was n't bad .
a bargain at $ 0 .
$ 0.00 for two .
"clean , comfortable , great style ."
oh yeah handed it right to her .
you ' re not saving lives .
you ' re not <UNK> the common cold .
always a good time .
nothing really that great about it .
it ' s a mediocre burger .

0nd branch of monta ramen .

fantastic addition to the neighborhood .
one of the best ramen spots in las vegas .

the food is delicious and very consistent .
this review is for the hotel & casino .
this is the ultimate greasy spoon indeed .
he takes incredible pride in what they produce .
you will come out of a random montreal bar .
a kick stand and a pseudo basket .
i ' d avoid this place .
flattened dough with ingredients on top .
late night eats for cheap .
staff was friendly with trying to assist however .
they have a decent brewery as well .

staff was very friendly .
one of the best japanese restaurants in summerlin .
the cheesesteak was outstanding .
the red italian pizza was absolutely amazing .
the 0rd and final is of coarse the food .
pretty standard fare from a somewhat limited breakfast menu .
hands down best sushi in vegas .
fish is extremely fresh and tasty .
ordered the burrito of the week which was beef .
do n't be afraid to ask for spicy .
sabor exceeds that expectation .
"outstanding , fresh , nothing else needed to say ."
top notch as well .
you will not be disappointed .
marc is a true professional .
the food is amazing here .
the best part is they take requests .
"great story telling , great magic , must see !"
this place lives up to all the hype !
plenty of choices for all taste <UNK> .
"again , hail caesar !"
the flamingo sports book is close as well .
would make it 0 stars .
good destination in downtown .
plenty of entertainment and people watching to be had .
what more could you ask for ?
its all you can eat .
started with miso soup and crab as well .
the brisket was undercooked and tough .
we ordered two gyros with fries .
the food is great .

this place is great .
it is that good .
not bad for a 0 course saturday night .
this place is the definition of awesome .
another downside is the inside .
dr . browns soda 0 .
the service was also a solid 0.0 .
are you from mars ?
i am looking forward to my next trip up !
the only downside is their change in policy .
great hummus and fattoush salad .
pita jungle seems to break the mold .
start off with the baba ganoush with chicken .
finish your meal with the baklava coupe .
pita jungle gets a solid 0 stars from me .
"for example , the add on fees ."
the sesame chicken is very good .
i would recommend any of the three i mentioned .
pane bianco represents the <UNK> hipsters paradise .
this place just <UNK> the <UNK> smug vibe .
the staff is very friendly and always attentive .
i do n't see the allure to this place .
but the hotel ' s beat up .
nonetheless there must still be standards .
they are also very military friendly .
yesterday was my third visit to la <UNK> .
i found the staff to be very friendly .
i highly recommend several trips here .
speedy service and a great menu .
spiffy little diner with very friendly staff .
"good on you , canada ."
an outstanding experience all around .
"loud , overpriced and under portioned ."
one of the worst benedicts i have ever had .
hollandaise was nothing to yelp home about .
lets back up a bit .
so perhaps just bad luck ?
... your are smokin the <UNK> my friends .
if i could there would be two reviews here .
customer service would be a 0 star .
lets start with your parking choices .
you advertised it in an arizona specific newspaper b .
great place with great people .
thank you and well done folks !
"not bad , not bad ."
what do they have ?
lazy ass piss poor food .
lets get the positives out of the way first .
http://url notice no goopy reduced soy sauce mess ?
the moral of the story ?
what a great concept for making money .
you have a $ 00 gourmet pizza .
best burger joint hands down !
server mandy was excellent !
service could use a little work .
i have recently found another place .
oysters were cold and clean .
casual spot for creative and delicious pizza .
which was a flat out lie .
best french restaurant in las vegas .
good coffee and very friendly service .
would give it 00/0 stars for the personable staff .
great place to watch games .
"except the poke , do n't eat the poke ."
the best cirque du soleil show in las vegas .
the insulation is terrible for these houses .
bacchanal buffet is probably the best buffet in vegas .
actually it is the best buffet in vegas .
hence the near $ 00 price tag .
i did n't expect zumanity to be this good .
it was best sushi place in town .
. quality is going down .
came here a while ago with the wifey .
the 0 star is for the service department .
well today was no exception .
great ownership best in vegas : - rrb -
"great food , poor service ."
"nothing mind-blowing , but good food ."
"no exaggeration , just awful ."
staff is friendly enough .
it ' s essentially ` their cheeseburger .
pad thai and curry all day .
"at least , i would hope you were wrong ."
the stuff we ordered was good .
she tried mine and thought the same .
one was the appetizer we chose .
i was right on the money .
it was very good .
great vibe and good food .
you can tell they use top notch ingredients .
ca n't wait to get back .
i grew up in paradise valley .
the bartenders knew how to take care of you .
then it all changed .
it was <UNK> to say the least .
so fast forward to end of 0000 .
wow ! ! what a mess .
this cost me about $ 00 .
this is not one of them .
"old , <UNK> furniture , rooms smell like smoke ."
the place has not been updated for many years .
you can do far better at other locations .
they should stick to what they do best .
i would avoid this location .
"service was quick , friendly , and courteous ."
first time visit to bill johnson ' s .
the pulled pork was bland .
the highlight were the sides .
"baked beans , great flavor and a little tang ."
what kind of bs is this ?
i have stayed at the hotel many times .
the problem this time was the late check in .
i was very obvious the whole hotel is understaffed .
the service and food was consistently excellent .
what an incredible establishment and staff .
overall my stay was very nice and enjoyable .
it ' s a short walk to the restaurant .
hungry for a cheesesteak ... perfect place .
the dim sum was really good .
- rooms are mediocre restaurants are mediocre .
some drawbacks were the internet and crowded pool .
the ramen is not all that spectacular imo .
"wow , this place was great ."
i ordered the sea scallop appetizer which was disappointing .
the bottom was charred and had a charcoal taste .
the casino floor was also a sight to see .
even the hotel ' s cafe was beyond expectation .
good service and great location .
just returned from the 0000 arizona taco festival .
"service was great , very friendly staff ."
there has been a redesign in the layout .
"chili , silverware , sauces , etc . ."
after hearing about this place .
first time using fox rental from phoenix location .
i ordered a pound of shrimp hot trifecta .
i got ta say it was pretty good .
cool place to hang out to eat and drink .
would definitely recommend this as a hangout spot .
looks like it could be a cool hangout spot .
lets start off with the sushi .
the nigiri had just a bit too much rice .
place was very well lit .
the decor and lighting looked really nice as well .
its not bad but i ' ve had better .
this is bad business .
this place deserved better than 0.0 stars .
each person got their own french press !
but overall they went very well with the steak .
you can catch the bellagio show across the street .
good place to stay in vegas .
really small overpriced candy store in the mirage .
saw steve wynn entering the club .
apparently he has a private room overlooking the club .
$ 00 including tip .
thanks coyote ugly for getting me drunk again .
very simple and traditional take on classic dishes .
a 00 minute sensory overload .
"i sat first row , $ 00 seats ."
prices were reasonable and service was standard .
"free headphones , water , and towels are provided ."
thomas keller is a genius .
not as many selections .
nothing really stood out for me .
perfectly cooked and seasoned with rock salt .
the dipping sauce made it kinda better .
how did you know ?
awesome way to end the meal .
do n't forget about the explosions and fireworks .
the show lasts about 00 minutes .
- do n't get the sapporo fish and chips .
you can find that at the hotel food court .
the nicest and funniest dealer you ' ll meet .
most expensive greeting ever .
"go here , walk around once , then leave ."
more on that later .
the wait was <UNK> long ; 00 minutes .
looks like someone dipped into their retirement fund early .
"maybe like 0nd or 0rd , but not 0st ."
i really liked the concept of the place .
the gf ordered the grandma pizza .
kind of a letdown .
each night was an average of around $ 000 .
the room is huge and very spacious .
"well , in theory ."
this place looks a lot smaller .
make it a point to get here .
my name was on the tv and phone .
i think i need an encore stay at encore .
what was up with the cocktail waitresses ' <UNK> ?
the <UNK> balcony & bar was nice .
gave me the best possible service with tracking .
this is an excellent spot with great service .
the food is excellent and is very nicely presented .
the brunch in here is unforgettable .
for drinks and snacks while watching a game ok .
service was slow and lackluster .
stick to beer and fish sticks .
". a vinegar , sugar marinade that is perfect ."
nicely presented sushi bar .
rarely do you actually hear a new concept .
first and last time here .
"i have cash , no biggie ."
is n't that against some rule / procedure ?
it is quite gleaming .
do not risk using these for your pool !
excellent food all from fresh ingredients .
juices were fresh squeezed and very tasty .
came here for the irish style food .
<UNK> is a very good sushi restaurant .

i believe the crew here are from hawaii ... .
"i ' ll be honest , i had better ."
"excellent , i ' ll be back for sure ."
"very nice room - very clean , like new !"
free internet - both wireless and <UNK> .

very good food for a fair price .
my wife love this place !

stay tunes for my post trip review .
i did enjoy my stay here overall .
this experience might bring me back this direction .
not the best pt ' s experience .
great value for lunch or dinner .
these guys were great .
a great value in my mind .
here ' s the story .
that ' s where the story gets good .
good wood fired thin crust simple pizza .
a bit <UNK> inside for active little ones .
will never set foot in this place again .
most of the time hipster barista is outside smoking .
the alfredo sauce is the best i have experienced .
"try the chicken wings , too ."
"wings were over sauced , buried to be exact ."
for hot sauce it had a good flavor .
liked being able to sit at the beer bar .
<UNK> this is a novelty restaurant .
"the food is ok , drinks a little better ."
michaels is like an amplified version of it all .
very very good pulled pork sandwich .

0 - rrb - no casino .
convenient and consistently pretty good .

they had my favorite fried fish in town .
they ' ve all been great .
they were all excellent .
the ones that are good are .
the ones that are bad are pretty bad .
"they charge for refills on soft drinks , too ."
the rib eye is solid and unpretentious .
"you come for meat , you will get meat ."
the entrees are good and the sauces are tasty .
the ones at <UNK> ' s are comparatively small .
the breakfast offerings are also quite good .
i like the german samplers a lot .

the staff were extremely nice as well .
a perfect place to stop after a long week .
this place is solid .
"it ' s cheap , especially for campus ."
beer battered cod and chips - was pretty good .
less choice in the stir-fry .
we ' ve been 0-0 times now .

"this place is great , though hidden away ."
and that some of the menu options .
. did n't really match what was being described .
but the food is much better .
"very , very midwestern mexican ."
the burrito was not wrapped up .
the sides were forgettable .
"the soups are massive and very good , too ."

this place is amazing .
"overall , it ' s a solid place ."
the tempura squid is also tasty .
"her burger had avocado , lettuce , and tomato ."
my girlfriend ' s burger had much less avocado .
the patties were extremely thin and bland .
edit : a note on this review .
"personally , i prefer <UNK> for a few reasons ."
this place is awesome .
it is the best in town .
that seems to be what ' s happening here .
i ' d look elsewhere for <UNK> food .
it is also one of the cheapest .
the food has always been good .
this is a taco bell alright .
it ' s a burrito !
i had the complete opposite experience with lvac .
these guys did a great job .
ive seen nicer motel 0s goin cross country .
did have the chicken noodle soup instead .
some ribs were good others too dry .
they had a chinese section that was just ok .
the place was just ok .
the carnitas and pastor was delicious .
i ate the asada and carnitas .
i did like the roasted serrano chile .
the tables all needed cleaning when i arrived .
this was the team hotel .
the rooms are a little dated .
they do not have wired internet ports .
perhaps it was the location of my room .
the staff was great .
it ' ll do in a pinch .
<UNK> is one of las vegas ' best .
working with him has been an extreme pleasure .
i highly recommend the triple j boys .
ate in for lunch .
the old avenue was perfect .
it feels like the hotel restaurant of a marriott .
the laid back perfectly wisconsin environment is gone .
classics like the old avenue are priceless .
the salesperson forgot to order the couch we purchased .
avoid at all costs .
i guess the harrah system is run-down .
they have a bar with beer on tap .
"fun , comforting and quite atmosphere ."
"great service , food and location ."
still the best for tacos in vegas .
love this mom and pop restaurant .

another bit of ny in the desert .
easily best bagels and lox in vegas .

"amazing food , really light ?"
this is true heavy french good stuff .
"highly recommend , great casino too ."
"breakfast , lunch or dinner it is all good ."
it ' s not all that long or big .
"utterly <UNK> , 000 % cafeteria food ."
dinning on another level .
the deserts were out of this world .
the little ham and cheese sandwich was amazing .
need to book it 0 months in advance often .
. food was pretty ok !
kind of a goofy half joke place .

the best gourmet burger on the strip !
not sure i would ever order the <UNK> burger .
not many are sit down restaurants .
i tried the pork bowl this time .
plenty of meat and rice and great vegetables .
not a fan of the pineapple fried rice .
but the pad see <UNK> was amazing .
watch your spice level .
it ' s hotter than you request !
and no acknowledgment of spg status .
perhaps i just had a bad room .
bad - rooms and bathrooms are small .
vent <UNK> was broken .
"great place , food is everything i expected ."
the owner is super cool too .
i ' ll keep this short .
there must have been a mistake in the system .
catch his hypnosis show .
comedy hypnosis succeeds with great imagination of its participants .
pho so 0 is large by vietnamese restaurant standards .
noodles are also ample .
you do have to be mindful of your surrounding .
excellent breakfast everyday with a very helpful staff .
it seems to draw friendly talkative patrons .
. the burger was nice and juicy .
probably the best burger i ' ve ever had .
the ribs were fatty and very small portions .
the prices are way out of line .
"the question is , for how long ."
great place and no smoke .
nice menu with great daily special ' s .
parking is also good and atmosphere is good .
"bottom line is , nothing will be done ."
that ' s all i remember .
did not have a good experience at longhorn tonight .
the steak was cold when brought to the table .
they do very shoddy work .
wings took almost a full 00 minutes really ?
i feel like the service is very personal .
but a great cocktail bar none the less .
only 0â 0/0 servers for the place .
can not recomend at all .
"great service , no <UNK> there ."
now extends all the way up to alexander .
great for bikes and runners .
"wow , <UNK> has turned my life around ."
"increased flexibility and less back pain , for example ."
mind and body both were <UNK> to the <UNK> .
wine that is good and priced right .
followed by veal milanese .
i was way too full for desert .
have had many good meals here .
we ordered grilled lamb chops and gorgonzola crusted <UNK> .
fast and friendly service with reasonable pricing .
my french knife is now like a razor .
its the best diner in all terms .
been here before and will return again .
"food was primarily steamed , not fried in grease ."
better than the one i make .
its the thursday special .
good service and not rushed .
"good coffee , fresh roast beans ."
"good selection of greek wines now , much appreciated ."
these folks go the extra mile with service .
quick service and all those noises have gone away .
what a great tune-up on my bike .
stopped by here for an early lunch .
the staff was also very friendly .
just had the worst food delivered to my house .
rented from 0 to 00 november 0000 .
you can not go wrong here .
the flavor profile is out of this world .
worst pizza i have ever had .
i got the invisible man treatment at the bar .
maybe it does n't work that way here .
the kitchen staff clearly does n't give a fuck .
i ' ve had hot pockets that tasted better .
both burgers were amazing .
the food is fantastic .
usually i get a sirloin oscar style cooked medium .
and the oscar style is remarkably delicious .
my wife thought her dish was just ok .
and there was never any mention of desert .
my wife and i visited on saturday october 0 .
overall she was great .
it was a nice touch .
the lamb was tender and the sauce excellent .
same for the beef tips .
his product and service are second to none .
quality sandwiches and great soups at a reasonable price .
their bread is excellent as are their soups .
overall it was a pleasant experience .
that is all nice and fine .
you ' ll for sure be back again .
and learn about ` ` heads ' ' .
the rooms were nice and modern .
i must sadly report that it fell way short .
and thai food should be great .
<UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lotus of siam !
"oh , and the price ! ? ! perfect ."
the quality of their food is below average .
"bottom line : good location , but horrible experience ."
"in my opinion , stay away !"
we were treated to a small family-friendly atmosphere .
though the server / boss - lrb - ?
was there a logical reason ?
this is the place .
i ' m a big fan of breakfast food .
the potatoes were spot on .
service was very good .
this pizza was good .
my eyes were larger than my belly that night .
and lulu ' s earned that spot .
"perfect breakfast , period ."
five stars for the food and beer selection here .
"i like food , i like beer ."
another one to try is the bacon cheeseburger .
it is then cooked with more syrup .
it is <UNK> than good .
' ' service was top notch .
the appetizers are good .
the service is outstanding .
order what you want and it comes very quickly .
they got the extra star for the beer selection .
i ordered their stuffed pasta pizza .
everything in it was spot on .
now as for the chicken wings .
they are among the best i ' ve had .
it ' s loud here .
"all that aside , the rooms are excellent ."
i have a separate review for their restaurants .
service is excellent even when packed .
creamy and a lot of crab meat .
the nachos were excellent .
delivery is slightly above average .
this place is off the chart .
he then gave us a few serious recommendations .
"not recommended , these guys are scum !"
"the best , freshest and most affordable sushi around ."
try the burning skull roll ... awesome .
the rooms are very clean and comfortable environment .
everything you want out of a ramen place .
the kicker : any style eggs on the side .
this is poor poor business practice .
this place sucks and i will never go back .
the appetizer was the waffle fry nachos .
$ 0 was a good deal .
my wife ordered the burger cobb salad .
at $ 0 it was a good value .
i ordered the buffalo chicken breast sandwich .
and the check breast covered the entire bun !
the sandwich was fantastic .
"only criticism , no beer on tap ."
this is not going to be a fair review .
i visited the margaritaville cafe on 0/00 / 00 .
about 00-00 people waited in this line .
this is my first visit to any johnny rockets .
a fun family atmosphere for a casual price .
what can you do ?
this place is a hidden gem off the strip .
mexican band and <UNK> is another cool feature .
one of the few places that <UNK> perfection .
lets leave talking about the food until the end .
the wait staff is friendly and professional .
really good thai food .
the price is also decent .
the beef wellington was excellent and so tender .
waited over 0 hrs to be seated for dinner .
the beer was cold !
the service was decent .
the deserts are great as well .
hall ways were very warm .
"tight seating arrangement , but worth it ."
this meal did not disappoint me .
along with a tall beer and mashed potatoes .
overall definitely 0 star experience .
management really needs to look into this very unprofessional .

i told him to stop by this spot .
great place to learn and watch birds .
. staff is friendly and knowledgeable .
came in from new jersey to catch my <UNK> .

this strictly a review on the cafeteria .

the service was off the charts also .
dud o mention the breakfast was cheap .
this was an ample portion of pasta and meatballs .
good taste and reasonably priced .
on this visit i went to the gift shop .

ft . worth ribeye with mashed potatoes and applesauce .
i was immediately greeted and seated .
fried egg was just the right topping .
overall a very pleasant meal .
they are a choice hotels gold award winning property .
not sure why this is listed as closed .
pleasant staff both at check-in and departure .
"little plaid top , shorts , and boots ."
both were very good .
"five stories , interior entrances , elevator ."
wow does this place have tv ' s !
all of them are large <UNK> screens .
just your average sandwich - good but nothing special .
first visit since 0000 .
which my server kindly provided .
you ' d be better off at a hooters .
this hooters is impressively large for a downtown location .
meatball sub = awesomeness .
large size is indeed large .
"like the decor , especially the mural ."
the burger came with fries and a pickle .
"four stories , interior entrances ."
nice presentation and clean surroundings .
they really piled on the turkey in the sandwich .
food was hot and staff was polite .
"wifi signal was strong , king bed was comfortable ."
the lower tier channels all came in snowy .
nice selection of foods in the free breakfast buffet .
we are n't talking your average continental breakfast here .
had not stayed here in some time .
i highly recommend this comfort suites .
' ' to all that entered .
the steamed bagel sandwiches and coffee are great .
revolution pizza replaced pizza fusion in the met .
one of the positive changes is the garlic knots .
i definitely recommend ordering these .
they should bottle it up ... why not ?
nice compliment to the meal .
i will definitely make some more visits back here .
good sandwich variety and appetizers at decent prices .
nothing bad or great to say about it .
similar to an applebee ' s but with sandwiches .
the fried cheese was also great .

this will be a new staple for me .
the slow roasted chicken was great .
tastes great and is stronger than expected .
small place with friendly service .

the one highlight we had was the broccoli salad .
nothing really special here .
cool little place in south end .
casual food and drink for good prices .
this is becoming my favorite mexican restaurant in charlotte .
and i will be going back here again .
value is n't there .
"hidden place , but the breakfast crepe was great ."
really fresh food with some creative dishes .
- rrb - but no big deal .
almost like a <UNK> version of panera .
. apparently from tennessee .
the big plus here is their service .
great meat sauce and tons of cheese .
cafe monte was a good french lunch spot .
the park also has some basketball and tennis courts .
"overall , it ' s a cool park ."
good change up from fast food .
solid rotisserie chicken and dipping sauces .
"the aesthetics and service was really good , too ."
tender ... and tasty .
this is where i go to get my contacts .
the disappointment comes when you get your bill .
i will probably be avoiding it in the future .
ok food at best .
maybe i caught them on a bad night .
good sandwiches and appetizer selection .
the sugar bacon and chicken & waffles are unbelievable .
the selection and prices are great .
the shopping experience was easy and borderline <UNK> .
this place should move closer to the city .
net score = 0 .
"overall , the pizza was great ."
hoping for a drink menu next time .
"the service here is solid , though ."
"the garlic knots were pretty good , though ."
the only real negative was the service .
. to try the breakfast food out .
the sub options are good and easy to customize .
the house made mozzarella and balsamic vinegar are incredible .
"for dinner , i tried the beef <UNK> ."
"got the pepperoni pizza , and it was great ."
pretty tasty monster sized burritos .
location hurts this place .
"no complaints , but nothing stands out here ."
really friendly service and good food .
"the bar service was great , too ."
fresh pear butter and biscuits were a nice bonus .
the vanilla creme was outstanding .
definitely a staple for chinese food .
but it ' s all included with your meal .
i had beef wellington .
the service and ambiance is classic .
no need to spend $ 00.00 .
highly over rated buffet .
"great food , good service , cold beer ."
bad # 0 check-in .
# 0 no free internet .
# 0 does not follow up on complaints .
# 0 no one wins at slot machines .

arrived today at 00:00 and was promptly seated .
excellent service by mike .
the house italian dressing is good .
the pizza is decent though way over priced .
more if you opt for their signature choices .
"well , chef , what the hell ?"
why take all steak items off the menu ?
i have been going there for years .
it is a pleasure to be greeted by name .
keep up the great job .
old <UNK> burger is great .
circling and displaying emotional illness symptoms .
the place <UNK> of urine .
i told another staff female who also laughed .
the food here is pretty good .
but they sure are proud of their shakes .
the flavor is fantastic .
that ' s where the biggest disappointment came .
but grizzle in a filet ?
it ' s a real shame .
that ' s where the biggest disappointment came .
but grizzle in a filet ?
it ' s a real shame .
but no mention of the delay today .
"and more importantly , no apology ."
both meals were excellent .
the scotch was a single pour <UNK> .
$ 00 for two chicken dishes and two drinks ?
i for one wo n't be going back there .
the food was excellent .
the tap system is cool .
it fills your beer from the bottom up .
it leaves less head than other tap systems .
i had better get my money back .
"but the food was just meh , at best ."
"that said , wait for a table ."
tip : sandwiches come a la carte .
* garlic bread w / cheese * very solid .
"good food , simple decor and good service ."
old style greek restaurant in the charlotte tradition .
the replacement took about and hour .

hope they do well .
the steaks are always perfectly cooked .
"good pizza , good people , great place ."
definitely worth your time to check it out .
an absolutely stunning place to visit .
this was worth the 0 hour drive .
i felt aloha spirit here @user poke express .
and i could taste it in their poke .
this is a must visit in las vegas .
0 hours of driving and no bagel chips .
did n't feel the aloha spirit there !
the salmon and panna cotta was very good .
the fettuccine was excellent !
"service was a bit slow , but nice place ."
this was really about managing expectations .
brilliant classic and unexpected combinations .
worth the effort to call ahead and order .

one of the reasons why i love coming here .
but not at sam ' s town .
my wife is a smoker .
thank you for reading this .
big place and in good shape .
the staff is incredibly slow and disinterested .

mine love the fried mac-n-cheese wedges .
out of donuts and machine was down .
quaint little irish pub .
the soup was fantastic .
was it the best mexican food is las vegas ?

the brisket and pulled pork were fantastic .
$ 00.00 ribeye dinner .
you get on awesome deal right there .
the service was good but the food was not .

"atmosphere is 0 star , price could be better ."
the hours have changed .
le reve is just that .
"a <UNK> world ... who knew , right ?"
really excessive and not required a most places .
certainly not a glowing review .
my biggest complaint is the value .
locals can get a 00 percent discount .
this place just keeps getting worse and worse .
no one else even comes close .
the regular prices are not that much higher .
this is probably due to bad word of mouth .
this place is awesome .
the chef was able to accommodate vegetarians quite well .
the <UNK> were also very tasty .

the food is good .
excellent french fries and battered fish .

' ' they even include <UNK> with the price .
the food was amazing .
lobster tail and 0 oz .
avoid this er - the wait is ridiculous .
total wine also has a pretty good keg selection .
they also have a reasonable keg return policy .

plenty of other non-sushi items on the menu too .
this place really has a family-run establishment atmosphere .
perfect naan and paneer tiki masala .
great place to play darts .

the bland liquid ruined it for me .
i do not understand outdoor malls in las vegas .
the quality on this place has really dropped .
amazing $ 0.00 breakfast .
but breakfast is where this place really shines .
monday - friday 00am - 00am .
check it out and you wo n't be disappointed .
it definitely shows in the quality of the food .

that sort of thing just blows my mind .
everything else about the burgers was top notch .
they were very professional and easy to work with .

awesome selection of bottled beers .
my most recent trip was to see amy <UNK> .

it seems like it has never been renovated before .
the competitive program is demanding but rewarding .
"food was okay , not really that great ."
it was pretty bad ass .
i was on the 00nd floor right above <UNK> .

i had the ipa and the danish redneck .
the bill would be 000 bucks .
the entire 0 hours went by all to fast .

i hope this helps .
i am used to breakfast burritos being somewhat hearty .
to top it off there was no cheese .
come on the burrito has 0 ingredients .
much more bang for the buck .
he referred to the coupon as a welfare check .
"anyway , this place sucks ."
even the corn was ice cold !
this is a no go fo sho .
that amount is right around $ 000 .
my car was scratched there today .
the gm said he is going to investigate it .
i got a real bad vibe from the guy .
i know this is a new scratch .
here is a link that talks about it .
i ate here tonight .
i have been here 0 times now .
needless to say it is much better now .
they make everything from the burgers to the buns .
well this is similar to a review like that .
i ' ll start with a little background .
today that has changed .
anyway they took no responsibility for the tire .
jeff told me that he did hook me up .
the entire experience fucking sucked .
i guess i am wrong .
i am a fan of this dealership .
it took me a while to find the leak .
i ca n't make this stuff up .

its almost to a point where it is funny .
live and learn right .
well it had pickles on it .
what can i say about pei wei .

neon colored frozen yogurt was totally up their alley .
coffee is consistently good .
service is usually pretty good .
00 minutes from downtown or 0 minutes from epic .

it is a secret gem .
not watered down with some real taste .
absolute must visit and taste !
"was greeted immediately , seated and waitress arrived promptly ."
i ' ll be back .
hard to pass up the road kill burrito .
do n't go looking for the lobster .
they really hit the mark .
<UNK> carousel or mountain high ice cream ?

not that any of this matters .
but do n't expect to be blown away either .
i do n't know the <UNK> of the cuisine .
"that being said , i like <UNK> ."
' ' i really hope this place makes it .
authentic mexican food at inexpensive prices .
friendly and attentive staff .
the cleanest filiberto ' s i have seen .

. total price with tax was approx .
will be coming back and bringing friends .
great mexican food at great prices .
"yes , and i will tell you why ."
"what can i say , this is panda express ."
this place is disgusting .

xs is like chicken soup for the soul .
chuck is a real inspiration .

"anthony bourdain , good lord ."
what were you thinking ?

feels like a tourist trap - rrb - .
those should pretty much wrap together the experience here .
very cool to try once .

this is probably your best bet .
a lot of the casino shuts down at night .
doubt i ' ll be back .

this ca n't be a corporate property .

the three of us <UNK> agreed on this .
the duck was perfectly cooked and had tremendous flavor .
"but great flavors , nonetheless ."
"probably a good thing , knowing me and vegas ."
my biggest gripe about this place was the waiter .
how about an actual breakfast place ?
best free bread on the planet .
"jesus christ , just give me the free water ."
whatever the fuck you call it .
look ... i ' m in vegas .
it ' s the same shit .
so i did n't like the deceptive upsell tactics .
and their d'lish pizza is just that !
this place is killer !
and drew the bartender is killer .
this place has a great vibe .
the portions were larger than before also .
finally vegas has something this good .
"slow , slow slow ."
you will get my business in the future .
imo xs is overrated as a club .
"- no open bar , everyone pays for drinks ."
what a waste of space .
- go with cool female friends .
gets my blood flowing and gets everyone pumped up .
attention to detail and goes above and beyond .
you can get fantastic seafood in the desert !
will absolutely continue going back to this place .
that says a lot about him .
"at least , your typical americanized fast food fare ."
they sincerely seem to care about their customers .
the orange chicken is literally award winning .
maybe that is n't the reason .

i have to commend this business .
so these guys are 000 % !
veggie egg rolls were good with the peanut sauce .
i have been using <UNK> family plumbing ever since .
lori did a great job taking care of <UNK> .
you sold your soul to the devil for money .
over 0.0 m brownies made annually is impressive .
that pretty much sums up the entrance to tao .
that dish is unforgettable .
waitresses in poolside attire elegantly serve you .
ordered shrimp & grits and chicken & waffles .
bottom line : avoid brunch here at all cost .
breakfast and lunch selections were all very good .

the portions are great and the food was outstanding !
we felt very welcomed by the staff .
check in was at 0:00 - 0:00 .

i ca n't say enough about this place .
see ` ` bud w . ' ' review .

kids ayce is half price of the adults ' .
call it three stars for reaching middle management .
not as drunk and obnoxious .
best part of the experience ?
which usually means a sandwich .
service was flawless and intuitive .
left extremely full and satisfied .
"the service , however was above average ."
horrible experience again made sandwich wrong for 0rd visit .
<UNK> is the spot for that .
steak was tasty throughout .
fries were seasoned slightly but not <UNK> .
this place is a true gem in north waterloo .
a fun place with great sushi .
"amazing , personal , enjoyable experience ."
would have enjoyed some more spanish reds .
this place is a must for any foodie .
this would be 0-0 stars in my opinion .
the service really was not that good .
crumbs were n't wiped from the table between courses .
<UNK> of mexican food mediocrity .
the carne inside the burrito lacked tenderness and flavor .

i also got really sauced without intending to .
the only beef i had was with the decor .
i play the nickel slots and come out alright .
be kind and tip the waitresses .
this place is absolutely amazing .
service was horrible i think her name was <UNK> .
wow sound like i have to jump through hoops .
these guys are a joke .
my advice check your order before you leave .
these people are very expensive .
"that ' s right no sale , no coupon ."
owner is very arrogant and argumentative .
prices are very high .
they should put there thoughts on here as well .
that ' s about a 0 hour meal .
"nothing to drink , nothing to eat ."
that ' s all you have to know .

the bar staff was great .
great prices and customer service is top notch !

this review is long over due .
stay away from this place .
i really like there pizzas and sandwiches .
saved money on unnecessary repairs .
roberto is the man !
took me longer to get there .
this show proves h . l . <UNK> right .
not recommended for anyone with any <UNK> .
amenities : food : service : convenience : value :
the service there was great .
"overall , its ok ."
sushi is not bad but a little overpriced .
everything is fresh and the burritos are huge .
here ' s where it gets interesting .
however leaving the airport is not the end .
and comparing today its the double for shake shack .
do caesars charge them for their premium location ?
think about this place as a 00/0 cheesecake factory .
"a show , what is a show ?"
guy <UNK> restaurant isnt an exception .
even though this place will get you a car .
came here a late night to get some food .
dont have to do that to enjoy your evening .
"wonderful staff , very helpful ."
another 0 star review .
this was a great authentic meal .

very good but ordinary service .
strange for italian fine dining .
i would defiantly go back and bring a friend .
* large portions of food at affordable prices .
the mango sticky rice desert was good .
the fried bananas were terrible .
may be part of the reason it was lacking .
but man this place sucked .
"i ordered pancakes , hash brown , and bacon ."
the hash browns were good too .
awesome interactive experience and museum .
0 baby shrimp and no asparagus tips .
transaction 000000 field tech greg was awesome .

the $ 00 teriyaki was beyond bad .
"great property , great service , nice rooms ."
"parking , food , resort fees , ad <UNK> ."
great view and good ac .
they made no mention of this at check-in .
do not go to some crappy casino pizza hut .
these guys will deliver to your casino .
you ' ll have to meet them out front .
this a good spot for lunch at the airport .
meat was tender and juicy and had good spices .
this place is great .
potato salad was really good though .
this is a peeve of mine in poker rooms .
my 0 cents : take your gambling elsewhere !
the meet is well cooked and has good flavor .
the real star however is the outlaw burger .
but it ' s very good and enormous .
the sides were a mixed bag .
"kicking beans were good , hush puppies were terrible ."
very good dim sum .
as good as food gets .
the corn pudding was unbelievable .
the food was great again last nite .
it is as if they ignored it .
over all this place sucks in my humble opinion .
the crab is served all cold .
this seams to be done on purpose .
that poor cow died for this !
just go somewhere else and spend the money .
"overall , a great little restaurant ."
i will be back many times for sure .

the atmosphere and decor was splendid .
bloody awful if you are two guys .
this service is a useless scam .
stopped in for an oil change .
took me right in and even rotated the tires .
one of the best burgers i have ever eaten .
room itself was very spacious and comfortable .
the roof deck is a nice touch .
multiple subway entrances are a short walk away .

catchy tunes that enhanced the experience .
so i was rather surprised on the fish sandwich .
great location and <UNK> staff .

"courteous , professional and polite ."
what more could you ask for ?
great food every time .
recommend the carne asada burrito or fish tacos .
nice furniture at reasonable prices .
i would n't buy furniture anywhere else .
service is friendly but not over bearing .
sadly i will not eat there again .
a smile would have been nice .
the food was spectacular .
my friend raved about the steak .
the sandwiches are tasteless .
the menu says the foods are locally sourced .
they have great rates and are very understanding .
they ' ll make it worthwhile .

"staff is friendly , place is never too packed ."
ahhh ... thank god for good food .

this location in las vegas was trendy .
the salad turned out to be excellent .
my partner meal was good too .
the food was very good .
the complimentary valet was a nice touch .
over the years i have been there several times .
something has been lost here about the old place .

this is not a 0 star dining experience .
servers are very friendly .
just wish they could serve a little more efficiently .
good food and prices .
chef specials are always good .
i ' ve been to <UNK> twice .
"but hell , almost everything was gone ."
i was like yo this ai n't cool man .
they got the price raised .
you bet my ass <UNK> .
food in general is good .
you might want try the lemon pepper flavored wings .
onion rings are good starters as well .
avocado sauce with a hint of jalapeã ± o .
in and out in 00 minutes .
prices were reasonable for vegas sit down .
the website for the restaurant is misleading .
this is a great sandwich .
whereas inside it feels like a formal upscale restaurant .
bread was fresh out of the oven .
filet was well prepared .
wine selection was not large but varied .
unlimited beer and wine really makes this worth it .
cole slaw is simple better with some sauce .
portions were above average also .
basil rolls very good .
"service good , food good ."
. bunch of tough guys / <UNK> .
i would not recommend this location to anyone .
just ca n't beat this place for breakfast .
"check it out , you wont be disappointed ."
had a great breakfast .
ca n't beat this place .
show started near 000 .
so freaking crowded you ca n't see the band .
its so loud you cant hear the band .
fire marshall bill would close the place .
"great service , very fair pricing ."
"beautiful day , good food , good beer ."
great people at this store .
like the sliders and chicken strips .
wine is obscenely overpriced for crap wine .
have been a regular here for years .
all inside tables full .
roast beef sliders are great .
recommend this place highly .
dont come after dark .
a great selection of craft beers and fine wines .
wonderful meat and cheese plate .

let the wait staff make wine recommendations .
the food was ok but very overpriced .

beer was cold ; decent options for kids .
this place is an office favorite .
we arrived after the 0/00 / 00 cardinal game .
the seat prices are very high .
"on a hot day , it is brutal ."
it must have been equally brutal to the players .
avoid this stadium on hot days !
and it ends there .
and the asian cole slaw ?
then we where informed about the 00cent wings .
depending on overall service not just our server .
the manager leads by example .
qt is far and away the greatest convenience store .
everyone seems to know everyone else .
italian being spoken by more than half the customers .
"atmosphere is abundant , but the gelato is awesome ."
go away this is all we have .
"only one word to describe this place , terrible ."
its a nice place .

the food was very good overall .
the menu looked interesting and i love sushi .

the host came out and pumped up the crowd .
i highly recommend this show .
deserts were the best part .
i have no complaints about the service .

"it ' s called cornbread , not corn muffin ."
i want a big ass piece .

the wontons were authentic and tasted great .
this was one fantastic steak .
the habanero cream corn .
this place was good .

"nobody , that ' s who ."
i have eaten here four or five times .
the fish of the day was halibut .

the food is excellent - slightly creative pub style .
the food was <UNK> .
first and last time here .
"charge for ice tea refills , really ?"
we are so over this place .
<UNK> would have done a far better job .
"i mean , its hot dogs and french fries ."
"great taste , awesome flavors ."
took the car somewhere else to get it fixed .
would recommend walking before using these crooks .
a few of the beers here are ok .
the bartender initially was sort of a douche .
tried a beer sampler .
four regular beers and four seasonals .
this place is cool .
visit # 0 : liquid smoke .
cool place to check out .
def worth a few bucks and a moment .
... you cant get fresher sushi than that .
huge selection of fresh as well as frozen seafood .
tourist perspective : the beers were flowing here .
but there is crazy selection .
mix and match a <UNK> .
all the dogs were good eats .
they were all decently meaty .
the other flavors of dry wings were ok .
the guy behind the counter does not smile .

"no taps , pitchers , etc . ."
i had the 00 beer sampler .
the coffee here sucks ass .
the sushi is amazing .

the worst ran business in las vegas .
great beer selection and best burger ever !
gnocchi was more than i expected for sure .
could n't eat there .
absolutely the worst stay i have ever had .
"not just a couple , but hundreds ."
nothing in the rooms say luxury .
and the service was lack luster .
you will thank me later .
the breakfast menu is very limited and very boring .
the service for the most part was slow .
both times were great .
we just went to the new el burro .
the carnitas and shredded chicken burritos were tasty .
thank you <UNK> bill <UNK> and <UNK> development <UNK> .

the $ 00.00 will look like a bargain .
wait staff very friendly and not stuffy .
the staff is very knowledgable and kind .
the place was horrible .
do not be fooled by its appearance .
brother ' s is the real deal .
the answer is no .
this is the way small business is done .
came here because of the rating .
did i mention they have crab legs ?
"- rrb - , crazy philly , jalapeno poppers ."
grill city has a cafeteria style ordering system .
all their nigiri items look and tasted fresh .
overall a solid sushi spot for ayce .
this review is long overdue .
white tuna was melt in your mouth kinda good .
the uni too was very good and sweet .
they had very good pork belly as well .
all their bentos are excellent .
00 minutes later nothing happened .
this place is bomb .
only down side is they call me alex # 0
matt the manager takes time to visit every table .
what a nice change from most places .
for me this was the worst place ever .
i showed the server what was wrong .
the food is low grade at best .
even the french fries were sloppily cooked .
chicken is always great .
good food always fresh .
been there several times hoping it would improve .
wait staff pretty good .
i had the arizona burger good and spicy .
my experience with dr . tom was exceptional .
"ordered ribs , salad and baked potato ."
lets just put it in a box .
. who trained this idiot .

the breakfast buffet is wonderful .
so why only three stars ?
- there is no microwave in my * room .
"i had the fish tacos , which were ok ."
the service was actually really good .
the burger was good and fresh .
this time it worked .
this comes into play in a moment .
the pizza box was enormous .
"crap , there was a ton of pizza left !"

"friendly service , got the order correct ."
"wow , really yelp <UNK> ?"
a diamond in the rough .
but the food was excellent .
"the sides were ok , nothing special there ."
but me and my buddy really enjoyed it .
it was homemade orecchiette with sausage and <UNK> .
there are much better places to spend your money .
she stood up to the test and then some .
the seafood tower was delicious and perfectly done right .
it was a steak that i will never forget .
"out of sandwiches , even out of bagels ."
zero notion of customer service .
really enjoyed the good from this joint .
very fresh ingredients and very full of flavour .
"price wise , it was great ."
this is a trip down to something different !
"not bad , but very greasy asian style food ."
the guys there are nice .
they feel great and my vision is crystal clear .
mashed potatoes were real and not watery .
prime rib was tasty .
i also tried their breakfast buffet and no complaints .
i tried the italy and it was awesome .
if your in phoenix you have to come here .
incredible atmosphere and killer food .
the chicken fried steak was incredible .
wonderful spot for breakfast .
. and that itself was great .
checked it out ... its randy ' s spot .
. along with alot of elite mma fighters .
truely an amazing experience .
definitely coming back when i hit vegas again .
price is moderate for a full on buffet .
parking sucks if its busy .
i will be 000 % honest .
no safety net or anything .
it definitely stands out as it looks unique .
one of the better attractions in las vegas .
never tried a fat burger til i wen there .
price was above normal range for me .
just as many posted on here .
that should be expected .
this place is going to get sued for <UNK> .
this place is over hyped .
but service was sub par .
my expectations were exceeded !
that ' s a feat .
this is not how you run a business .
how fucking hard is it ?
"i can show ya , its easy ."
never fails and always through the drive through .
i think that ' s whack costumer service .
again ... feeling let down .
... best strategy might be to share .
sage fried chicken & waffles .
"hard to find , quad ."
states it closes at 0000 .
management should read these reviews and do something .
drinks are inexpensive and the bartender is very attentive .
the casino i must say is a different story .
bad news is definitely the casino .
has to be like a 00oz coke !
"simple , almost fast food soul ."
"good food , fried fish , fried chicken ."
did not have the collards or okra .
"next was the blackened , 00 oz ."
now to the staff .
the dress in my opinion varies .
customer service was top notch .
really really good korean restaurant in vegas .
we had shabu shabu and kimchi <UNK> .
food was sub par .
burgers and fries were cold .
food was room temp .
. drinks were not flowing .
. this place is great .
no place like i ' ve ever been .
it was reasonably priced and good food .
it was well worth the price .
$ 00 for absolute garbage service .
this is not a haute cuisine restaurant .
the sports theme has been their staple .
they also have a number of staples .
my wife loves their nachos .
though i liked the poutine the ravioli was awesome .
today was no exception .
well i got the name of this place wrong .
the smoked meat was <UNK> .
the wait staff was nice to us .
im not normally a wolfgang puck fan .
the mac and cheese was awesome .
the cheese was creamy with a distinct flavour .
it tasted good going down .
the portion size was quite filling .
this was built as a condo .
as such it lacks central air on the floors .
all of the units have <UNK> ac units .
- wireless internet does not work too well .
course 0 - roasted beef rib .
the place is huge inside .
two of my three kids had the kids pizza .
i ordered the bison ribeye .
then the ribeye showed up .
the bison ribeye was great .
so why did i rate the place as a-ok .
the food and service here are excellent .
a must see and eat place .
price was extremely reasonable and service very prompt .
no change after 00 years .
one of the hidden treasures of paradise valley .
frozen processed fish patties are not fish and chips .
do n't bother to order off the menu .
what ' s hot about the place ?
it ' s a freak show .
how do you screw up broccoli beef ?
even panda express does a better job .
the upkeep on the place is average .
the pizza tasted great .
my wife and i decided on four kegs .
both appetizers were perfect .
she still finished them off and i tried them .
` ` six ' ' stars ...
parents got free desert for anniversary .
the mariachi singers are entertaining and excellent !
the breakfast burrito was <UNK> large and delicious .
"nice enough , no frills ."
the queso is ridiculously good ... seriously .
and the homemade tortillas are also outstanding .
"aside from that , everything is average at best ."
"this is not <UNK> comida mexicana , mi amigos !"
it was hilariously underwhelming .
"nothing fancy , certainly no frills ."
it ' s a true shame .
i had the burger cooked medium .
it was ok ... not a great burger .
i think it might be a pre-made patty ?
she found it to be superior .
all-in-all ... four stars .
fun staff and a good happy hour .
it was a toyota <UNK> truck .
great local neighborhood place .
small menu and decent beer selection .
usually very crowded for dinner .
have always had great food .
pretty pretty good it ' s ok .
the food is just ok .
great staff and atmosphere .
not the best food .
look at my other reviews .
i get around the arizona restaurant seen .
i tried and agreed .
service was good and the ambience was hipster .
they even stayed later to accommodate the traffic delay .
the selection of beers is great .
the pictures make this place look huge .
the chips were from a bag from the store .
the prime rib tasted frozen at best .
location - different but not bad at all .
the duck fat fries are really nothing special .
the food was very good but the portions sucked .
no buffet for lunch and prices were good .
ship with broccoli is ok but ship is iffy .
this place is ok .
this place is a good lunch option .
the taste however was more then there .
price is reasonable and competitive .
not even food in the buffet .
bad from the start .
did i mention this place was dead ?
awesome pho and great staff .
one of the best things in town .
"<UNK> , with a side order of spring rolls ."
a big favorite of businesses in the area .
go and you will not be disappointed .
great stand by the best pizza .
the heat level of the food was spot on .
a 0-00 scale very true to what you say .
service was great especially for a indian restaurant .
the best indian food in the valley hands down .
great tacos and good price .
service is decent and the chips are top notch .
you will not be disappointed .
- lrb - perfectly fine - rrb - .
hopefully the owner reads this and make this right .
it has a gourmet twist .
try the <UNK> special wing sauce .
they have trivia on saturday nights at 0 .
great fresh food at a low price .
portions are right in line .
bring back the shrimp bruschetta ! ! ! 0 .
it turned out the new part was defective .
a great <UNK> coffee bistro in the northeast valley .
definitely worth a visit .
great service and the manager knew his stuff .
they do n't service locals well anyway .
lv cabs are terrible .
but still worth it for the quality and flavor .
this place has so much potential .
"and it being poutine , hey , why not ?"
next was <UNK> and the pdc melting pot .
this a great restaurant .
the finished product was exactly what i needed .
"better yet , just go some where else ."
no explanation was offered .
the staff is top notch .
anyway ... there were only 0 customers .
maybe ... if i was feeling cheap .
the atmosphere here is great .
the tacos are legit as are the fresh juices .
this rosati ' s customer service is horrible .
great food at a great price .
sorry to bother you sir .
my recommendation is that nobody else bother him either .
"another emeril restaurant , about what you would expect ."
rolls were slightly <UNK> and fairly tasteless .
reminiscent of a traditional irish pub .
great whiskey selection as well .
"other than that , great , great beer selection ."
about usual for these places though .
not expensive yet not a deal .
hint of bubble gum aroma with great <UNK> .
had enough dressing for two dishes .
great to have a brewpub so close !
- lrb - we went on fathers day .
the food offerings are fantastic .
good yet not fantastic .
great place for decent sushi and tempura .
menu is just the standards yet no complaints .
good happy hour and always enjoyable when dining there .
great friendly staff for dine in .
the revamped kids menu is impressive as well .
this place is for beer lovers !
the menu is not typical bar food .
the green chili sauce is outstanding .
amazingly simple and extremely addictive .
hopefully this restaurant becomes a mainstay in desert ridge .
inexpensive executive course even in peak season .
this is a great alternative to national chains .
now the menu lived up to its namesake .
busy sandwich shop that always delivers great food !
that guy there should be fired without question .
hawaiian chicken bbq was great .
they must throw out thousands of food everyday .
the food is very tasty though .
amazing combination of spices and dipping sauce .
try it you wo n't be disappointed .
they both had very good flavor and seasoning .
both side dishes were excellent .
"creamy , spiced nicely and covered in melted cheese ."
rich but not too rich .
overall a very good dining experience .
four stars only because of the poor wine selection .
and really bad food service .
id rated a 0 if possible .
drive to the next wood .
paid for a deluxe wash and got basic instead .
in the meantime the food sat there getting cold .
so if u come bring ur own .
"yeah , every thing is pricey at the venetian ."
the venetian lobby is just jaw dropping .
oh yeah i almost forgot .
the casino inside venetian is also pretty cool .
this place is more of a nostalgic place .
this place is all class .
to get some drinks here .
all the decor is in good taste .
and the service is excellent as well .
the food is as wonderful as they are .
good food and staff .
old school diner that is still on point .
donuts selection was good .
they go hand in hand .
surprisingly great overall atmosphere for the family .
the duck was well prepared and seasoned correctly .
"nothing spectacular , and priced accordingly ."
this is a smokers paradise .
"great food , interesting menu , good ambience ."
that would be thanks to yelp !

your only getting 0 stars cause of the decor .
big burger was pretty good .
cool ambience and very good service .

no <UNK> of flavor or heat was apparent .
after we had eaten off it ! ! wow !
"second , they have two nice electronic <UNK> ."
bought a <UNK> elite <UNK> from same outlet store .
they may all have been dropped off the truck .
first visit i had the roasted mushroom pizza .
total disappointment for a needed neighborhood pizza joint .
they do have good beer prices for happy hour .
well perhaps the initial recovery .
random stupid <UNK> decorations on the wall .
old cheap flat screen tvs .
cheap tables strewn about .
gordita chicken was dry but the sopes pretty good .
ben my bartender and jordan the manager were outstanding .
may be my favorite restaurant in all of wisconsin .
i ordered the gyro pita and fries .
i am a life long steelers fan .
just go and experience this place .
my problem came last night .
and <UNK> ' s has better beer selection .
staff was attentive and helpful .
my first bad was getting the sandwiches delivered .
i wouldnt go back nor would i recommend .
the reason for three stars only ?

the food alone was probably 0.0 stars .
getting to the valet parking location about 0:00 .
i still enjoyed the kobe beef burger .
the food here is average .
i tried the ramen and kim chi fried rice .
"not the best dim sum , but still tasty ."
we also tried the lamb chops .
lamb chops were good .
i tried the <UNK> killer breakfast skillet .
the portion was kinda big .
0 stars for the honey glazed salmon .
pretty good for the price .
as good as the shake shack in ny !
best sandwiches i ever had .
prime rib was good !
other foods was decent to good .
i ordered the bbq sampler .
"chicken , pork , beef , and ribs !"
yellowtail tar tar was ok .
beef tongue was good .

look for the plaza that says massage or <UNK> .
the default ramen does not come with an egg .
monta is better than anime .
very good <UNK> brick oven pizza .
maybe its the water .
lobster pho is pretty amazing .
nice place to go to celebrate an occasion .
i expected more for the prices they charge .
"but , i would wait a hour for it ."
but the meats that day and cooked perfectly .
it can probably feed 0 to 0 people .
it was not like normal buffets .
i tried nine of the dishes .
the steak and eggs were pretty good .
i tried the drunken noodles with prawns .
parasol up is upstairs and inside wynn .
parasol down is downstairs and outside .
not frozen and not hot .
each <UNK> was juicy and very meaty .
"surprisingly , the clam chowder was really good too ."
the garlic bread was soft and flavorful .
both dishes were excellent .
"excellent food , excellent drinks , excellent service ."
the brown mustard really complements the kielbasa .
"we really enjoyed the food , atmosphere and service ."
my wife must eat a gluten free diet .

the one star reviews are extremely accurate .
quality at its best .
quite a surprise here in the valley .

the food is five stars .
by far the best sushi in cu .
service sets this place apart .
that is how you take care of customers .
<UNK> is one of the best .
this place had 00 lanes ... wtf ?
central spot to everything .
service was quick and easy-going .
parking is either self-park or valet .
i ' d definitely stay here again .
you ' ll thank me later .
"in fact , too good to be true ."
so do n't expect anything top notch .
the sausage links are not your <UNK> links .
it helps to have one more .
large pancakes for an already large meal .
say it with me : wow .
diner joints like denny ' s do n't compare .
they make grand slams look like a joke .
the maine lobster was ok .
"nice , apparently new , spot ."
it ' s just a different type of obnoxious .
now for the important part ... the food .
no cover for us tonight ?
"drinks are generally proper , and priced average ."
i will not be making a return appearance .
- rrb - only a few thousand miles later .
"nice work , five guys ."
this place cracks me up .
and what ' s with the lack of condiments ?
what a <UNK> nightmare this place truly is .
my <UNK> home stereo sounds better .
"the buns are delectable , and a perfect compliment ."
"0 stars , no question about it ."
hate this place so much .
and my choice is obvious .
i much prefer la <UNK> .
the crust is tough and brittle without being crisp .
the place serves good food for a good price .

it would not go through .
he does n't know what he ' s doing .
wow is a good way to start with .
i was blown away with this show .
<UNK> check in counter in las vegas .
"checked in and checked our room out , <UNK> ."
"rooms , eh , ok at best ."
maybe they want insurance ! ! what a joke !

the different flavors were unique and distinctive .

i ' d have to agree .
. ` ` hugo ' s cellar is awesome !
"' ' instead , let me explain a little ."
really quite an interesting take on fusion cuisine .
"all said , it ' s ok ."
that ' s right ... a 0 star review .
tacos el gordo is the newest in that category .
a taco runs about $ 0.00 .
this is my first five star rating .
the donuts here are absolutely awesome .
saffron flavors of india has a good lunch buffet .
"last , the place is clean ."
it ' s $ 00.00 for the lunch buffet .

my friends order the <UNK> and <UNK> .
the bread is good .
the salad that comes with the meal is good .
the steak is good .
the seafood is good .

my first visit was great .
ca n't beat the tempura chicken strips .
the rock shrimp is a must .
find a better combo and let me know .
peroni on tap - cold as hell .
i ' ll be back again and again .
nothin ' to boast about .
that goes without saying .
you want to eat more than two courses .
i ' ll be back soon .
there ' s nothing bad to say about zipps .
this place does horrible work .
<UNK> is a complete sham .
the carne adovada is the shit !
great enchiladas ... i could go on and on .
<UNK> bomber and saki for something like $ 0 .
the soups here are also killer .
what the hell else could you ask for ?
their wings are awesome !
i made an appointment for noon by their suggestion .
"apparently , an appointment means nothing ."
spend your money wisely .
a good option for a quick lunch good quality .
service at the bar was excellent .
overall service was attentive and excellent .
this is really a tapas bar .
very good but tiny .
everything as expected ! ! awsome hotel and room .
for $ 00 on hotwire even better .
right by the fountain .
women can wear anything except shorts .
this has been my third experience with prime .
i guess i will look for something else .
they may need to revisit this policy .
i dont know it just ruined the entire experience .
good portions good bar food .
service at the bar ? ? bad bad bad .
"ordered a side of onion rings , awsome !"
nice place to sit outside for a little bit .
probably wo n't be back here for breakfast .
<UNK> fries are the bomb !
the fish selection are great here too .
"overall , i am a fan and will return ."
the potatoes were awesome too .
over priced dry burger .
` ` crawfish the poor mans lobster ' ' .
perfect place for breakfast with good quality ingredients .
they are very helpful and kind .
to me the sauces is what made the meal .
i felt like i just got ripped off .
ohjah certainly displays fresh quality ingredients .
the fries were ok also nothing special .
so burgers were as expected .
both were excellent sandwiches and were well thought out .
let ' s start with the le pig .
this location has always been helpful in the past .
over-hyped and under delivered on all fronts .
i returned the phone monday morning .
had very very bad service .
lady said only place to go was mandalay bay .
we watched it religiously .
"first , criss does n't perform the entire time ."
i ' d pay to see that .
because of the loud music ?
"finally , there ' s criss himself ."
i am a professional sales trainer .
criss tries to be a comedian with bad results .
"really , no one cares ."
everything he <UNK> about is on youtube .
the flying <UNK> were on visible wires .
that was a surprise i guess .
the believe lobby is cool .
i do n't blame the staff : poor planning .
check it out - i have never been disappointed .
this is a remarkable restaurant .
the wait service was friendly and responsive .
this place is a must visit in las vegas .
i came to las vegas for the ces 0000 !
i am the restaurant owner in ny !
this place has great potential but apparently poor management .
good service but the wings are so oily .
maybe stand these things up and let them drain .
first time to this shop .
however the food was far better than expected .
we had a party of 0 and devoured everything .
ca n't recommend this place any higher !
this is a must see while at the bellagio .
con ' s - the noise level was horrible .
"finally , the cost ."
the best buffet in vegas ?
"good food , attentive wait staff , reasonable price ."
olives is an ok middle of the road restaurant .
a nice place to dine .
this is indeed a classy establishment .
the wait staff is excellent .
steaks are perfect and cooked to perfection .
seafood entrã © e ' s are delicious .
service food quality were all without complaint .
they are 0 oz mixed with two different craps .
i would n't return for steaks .
overpriced and under served .
"the food was very average , nothing special ."
in my opinion it was n't worth it .
excellent smoke taste on their bbq .
the smoke pit is on the premises .
cant go wrong here !
in those stupid buffet lines at those casino ... .
had the best service here from adam .
- rrb - probably not your type of place .
plus all the drinks are extremely weak .
"great food , great decor !"
0.00 for breakfast croissant sandwich .
best bbq in town ... and a great carwash .
00 min later ... one of them came by .
"not many frills , but pretty solid overall ."
i ' ll never attempt to eat here again .
love the baby back ribs and brisket .
excellent sides as well .
did not address the problem .
the service was great .
great beer on tap .
we felt our waiter sean was excellent .
i consider the noise level less than acceptable .
my wife ' s salmon was under cooked .
appetizers were very good .
food came in a reasonable time frame .
"drinks , brewery beer , was great ."
food came quickly and was hot .
very clean and comfortable .
many better places for wings .
and by the way the place was not busy .
my wife and i shared the dinner for two .
she had the salmon and i had the steak .
liked the small sized soft shell tacos .
fish taco was great .
first thing i noticed was how clean everything seemed .
super modern and simple decor and menu .
when will a healthy option come to <UNK> ?
the perfect breakfast to get me buzzing .
a bit more casual in the bar .
chicken dish is special .
food is consistently good if not excellent .
we got hooked up with sales guy jimmy .
impressed on how patient jimmy was with us .
this process can be worse than buying a car .
this is that spot .
finished product was great .
i guess not your typical asian spot .
open til 0 am on a sunday .
always busy cause it ' s really good .
healthy options are plentiful .
great location on 000 and eastern .
very happy with my experiences here great spot .
from asian to indian curry .
lots to select from .
green chicken curry is outstanding .
keep up the great work !
kitschy atmosphere with eclectic menu and great drinks .
a cut above most but nothing overly exceptional .
and the price is reasonable for vegas .
sara works some magic .
"no <UNK> , this girl is fire ."
reasonable rates that include electric ... no electric meters .
close to vegas / lake mead / hoover dam .
boulder city is a nice quite city .
owners are very good people .
some made in china .
warranty not great either .
delivery times are n't so great either .
"go to empire chinese , instead ."
this place keeps on impressing me .
owners / management / staff are all super friendly .
other patrons say 0 * ! ! !
and the product is highly recommended .
the servers name was keith .
i will not be going back to this place .
the food was top quality .
"and i must say , i was impressed ."
the moving stage is just amazing .
the hotel is simple .
but was not outstanding .
for the price i would recommend it .
it was a 0 min walk to the stripe .
such a cool place .
one of my favorite and more frequently visited place .
what was the result ?
well done 000 east ... well done !
my girlfriend loves this place !
keep <UNK> great food and good service .
incredible sushi done by pros .
tons of draft beers leaning towards american microbrews .
not impressed ... crust was n't done very doughy .
so so slow and not done well .
some pros and cons though .
can hear airplanes flying over .
looking forward to many more visits .
' ' will never be using this company again .
this is just my favorite chinese food in phoenix .
anderson ' s <UNK> is great .
they have pepsi so no real rum and coke .
also great coffee constantly refilled .
the best pho in town .
back of the house so-so at best .
- rrb - - margaritas were great .
- atmosphere was more of a local dive .
"great food , great margaritas , great service ."
everyone loves a craft beer .
i would highly recommend .
overall pretty comparable to many other self-serve fro-yo places .
have the caribbean lemonade and the goat .
and some of the nicest people you will meet .
they cut you off .
"f @ $ @ you , <UNK> le plateau ."
they even have ketchup in the little dunking containers .
if you have window issues give him a call .
so they are good guys .
that ' s only a minor quibble though .
what more could you want ?
the food was bowling alley food .
the place is very clean and new .
this place is in a great location .
easy walking distance from other stuff downtown .
it is very bright and contemporary inside .
a very pleasant dining room with very cool decor .
next time you pass by give them a try .
all hail the ` ` cronut ' ' .
they have excellent guacamole and queso dip and chips .
luckily it was very good .
i highly recommend them both .
what more could you ask for ?
this is a great pizza place .
at least there is yelp .
the meat counter is second to none .
they are very helpful and everything is top quality .
the place is n't super fancy .
keep up the good work .
the staff here are very friendly and very helpful .
it ' s pretty much your standard theater .
since the ownership changed i have been twice .
i had breakfast here and it was very good .
probably my second favorite down here in chandler .
guess what ; no sales associate .
another year another review .
now they are better than when they were new .
the staff here are exceptional .
who can actually eat three ?
"i can see one time , but three ?"
what more can you want from a breakfast place ?
"they come in three , two , or one ."
what more could you want ?
the pizza choices are all build your own .
the sauce is a bit bland .
which is n't necessarily a bad thing .
not sure what else you could want .
not sure what all the hate is for .
great hole-in-the-wall diner food with excellent service .
you ca n't go wrong .
that was a big mistake .
not this day unfortunately .
the staff were very nice just a bit frazzled .
what more could you ask for ?
they really make this a wonderful place to eat .
the chile corn quiche being a stand out .
this place is fantastic .
went to see the <UNK> brothers here recently .
they are fairly speedy 0 .
the gourmet house is a pleasant surprise .
i have never seen that done before .
the food was just average at best .
the food was just average at best .
the staff here is exceptional .
so why three stars ?
as usual i have only been here for lunch .
these do n't seem to be very light dishes .
i will definitely keep coming here for lunch .
while still delivery some tasty pasty as always .
the pancake itself was very tough and pretty bland .
what can you say about a rock company ?
did the driver know what he was doing ?
i guess they want to move people out .
this is a very unique and awesome restaurant .
do they have cheap beer by the pitcher ?
"it ' s always a good , good time ."
for a quick lunch i highly recommend it .
ok here ' s an update .
the food on my visits has been very good .
keep up the good work .
the added bonus is the coffee is fantastic .
keep up the good work .
keep up the good work .
they are really good plain or with cheese .
they have very good sundaes and shakes .
the tofu vermicelli is really great .
so why am i leaving a review ?
this place has really gone down hill .
the lunch portions for the combos are huge .
the red sauce is tasty .
the real stand out is the fries .
very cool for a restaurant in az . .
the food is ok but lacked salt .
i would recommend not going in after 0pm .
keep up the good work .
the food and service are outstanding .
the staff here are really cheerful and very helpful .
"they have great salsa , queso , and chips ."
the real standout thing are the beer bread sandwiches .
they also come with some pretty awesome fries .
how do you make a fry better ?
that is way different than anything else around here .
a really outstanding place .
the grilled artichoke salad was delightful ... would recommend .
this was to combine flights .
there were no tv ' s nor music .
you could hear a pin drop during happy hour .
my veal chop was prepared perfectly .
worth the price of admission although expensive .
in some ways it ' s <UNK> pittsburgh .
great cocktails and very good food .
overall first class restaurant .
this is not <UNK> italian pizza .
there italian hoagie is great as well .
such horrible service for such a nice establishment .
we started with the alligator appetizer .
mustard and mayo are also provided .
maverick is a first class operation .
the kitchen was kind of slow .
<UNK> is a small executive airport .
the large restrooms are clean and well lit .
they really set themselves apart with their breakfast .
that was the case this morning - no problem .
newer <UNK> of this extended stay concept .
the chicken was done well and still moist .
service and atmosphere were average .
"however , they were out of several beers ."
rooms were comfortable and well stocked .
not dry at all .
this place is not bad at all .
do n't let the outside location deter you .
i thought that was a cool touch .
a pleasant surprise was the food .
both were excellent and a great deal .
i used to think this place was five star .
and enjoy the baseball memorabilia .
but its not top notch .
nice bar near the baseball complex .
this was at 0:00 on 00/0 / 00 .
good for the ambiance and experience .
"food just fine , but certainly not great ."
great food - fresh and plentiful .
also the atmosphere was fantastic .
decor was a 00 .
very high energy dining room .
desserts were good also .
sandwiches are always good .
there is nothing stingy about the sandwiches here .
the potato pancake has gone down hill .
prices are pretty expensive for tacos .
they serve the same things that el <UNK> served .
they also have beer on tap here .
just stick with the burgers .
the other cuts are great too .
hmm ... my favorite ayce sushi spot in vegas .
my girlfriend <UNK> for their sushi rolls and nigiri .
service here is also good .
a must-try is their palm job handroll .
they never came by to refill the coals .
spend your time and money on something else folks .
overpriced and poor quality .
their nem nuong cuon was pathetic .
i got the pho ga . .
they gave me a lot of chicken meat though .
really not the best place for ramen .
"excellent drinks , even better food ."
very nice and respectable wait staff .
food is quite delicious .
wait staff was a little awkward but pleasant .
for the price it ' s about just right .
very nice place with great staff .
i cleared my whole plate and was greatly satisfied .
"authentic , traditional bbq ."
its what you do best .
"wow , great food and service ."
neighborhood joint with lots of character and fun .
shrimp tacos and beef rellenos very tasty .
nowhere near living up to it ' s hype .
the place really aint much for the eyes .
right away we noticed how sparse the menu is .
especially if it is before lunch time .
do n't believe the hype .
some of my favorite nyc style crust .
they never post my review .
dr . andy and patti are absolutely amazing .
thanks to mark and his team .
the salmon alfredo is what i ordered both times .
this was terribly overcooked .
it is a shame and an amateur mistake .
visited here on a weekend trip to spring training .
my 0st service and my 0st review .
best in las vegas for breakfast and lunch !
"super friendly staff , food was fresh and authentic ."
had the steak and rice bowl here .
"if you eat here , pay cash ."
just found the altered charge .
the staff was courteous and professional .
the facility was clean and orderly .
the ballroom was well prepared prior to our arrival .
here ' s the reason for the 0 stars .
this is absolutely unacceptable .
a really <UNK> member of the franchise .
this hotel is not ready for prime time .
shady practices if you use a debit card .
i did not know where to start .
"even , by the pound , was quite inexpensive ."
haha their food was quite good .
one of the nicer airports i have been to .
i get the impression they are right wing <UNK> .
search for discounts online .
"anyway , a small distraction !"
"buffet is ok , but nothing special ."
not worth the trip to this place .
mexican food here does not deliver value for price .
promised response in 00 hours but no response .
can you believe the yelp reviews here ?
reviews mostly do n't know what they talking about .
the salad selection is lacking in variety .
most small portions are ok .
bottom line : would we come back ?
selections are varied but nothing really stands out .
ca n't beat it for staff friendliness & experience .
avoid any community managed by this group .
after ordering food first roll took 00 minutes .
beers where over 00 minutes .
"not 0 diamond , aaa got it wrong ."
what you see and hear are what you get .
this little place is definitely worth a visit .
cuisine seems greek to me but fairly good .
"so , essentially a fast-food experience ."
humus was quite good though .

korean bbq could be this good and affordable ?
avoid at all costs .
"excellent food , excellent prices , excellent service ."
great atmosphere and good location .

we went with the $ 00 summer tasting menu .
the meal started out with perfect bread .
"i enjoyed the tender , juicy quail the most ."
"my girlfriend said that hers was neither , unfortunately ."
the meat itself had hardly any marbling .
the only complaint i have is with the staff .
"the restaurant , however , is impossible to find ."
"the service , unfortunately , was crap ."
the location is pretty good .
"it gets soggy at the bottom , though ."
will be back again for sure .
as for the tacos - - top notch .
handmade tortillas really set them apart from other establishments .
that is the best you can hope for .
best surf and turf i ' ve had .
"as expected in vegas , top-notch ."
"the other food , i would not recommend ."
ordered the porterhouse and ribeye .
came here for dinner with my wife .
it ' s not even that cheap .
the food quality seems to have gone down .
$ 00 for the lunch buffet .
my problem is with the service .
that should have been the first bad sign .
"amazing food , reasonable prices , mom-and-pop shop ."
carne asada is great .
"friendly staff , great food ."
what more could you ask for ?
he promised to replace the tube in 0 minutes .
i was impressed and <UNK> this shop wholeheartedly .

"the tempura vegetables were , again , just ok ."
dessert was the highlight of the meal .
"for the price , i ' d go elsewhere ."
"<UNK> : service , <UNK> kids , fried rice ."
this would unfortunately be a theme throughout the meal .
the waiter gave a <UNK> <UNK> for every request .
he recommended a lovely pinot noir .
the lamb was also amazing .
it was so good my wife ordered it again .
"it was hard work , but worth the effort ."
fantastic ending to a magnificent dinner .
i found it as a double helix .

"both were excellent , and the service was <UNK> ."
we will give according to the service .
i ' m sure the other place is better !
it is very good .
one of the best in french restaurant .
the rabbit is very good .
the washroom fan does n't work .

food and service is really good .
we love house music but the dj was crap .
the place is unique and people are friendly .

"all in all , worst restaurant experience ever ."
this place is horrible .
ate here for a client dinner .
duck fat fries make up for any negatives though .
would likely look elsewhere next time .
ordered the burger melt and a draft .
"beer was fine , burger lacked tremendously ."
food came out fast .
other favorites are the panang curry and spicy noodle .
just another downtown hipster joint with over priced food .
hands down the best bbq in az . .
not really a bad seat in the house .
. even from the upper deck .
try the <UNK> 0.0 imperial red .
"its a seasonal brew , so try it soon !"

i decided on their imperial stout which was amazing .
so 0 beer was enough to appreciate it .
wow this was super good .
that is a good thing .
the smoked porter was great too .
after we had the pale ale and irish red .
a strong but refreshing red .
this was my wife ' s favorite beer .
mine has to be the imperial ipa .

even better with a craft beer next to you .
anyways our experience at fate was excellent .
great beer selection of super hard to find brews .

but the food quality was just average .
same as pork dish .
still same great food .
overall a good addition to the cornish pasty restaurants .
the molten lava cake was awsome and definitely memorable .
come her on saturday nights to see bull riding .
it ' s like a super kilt lifter !
"overall , a solid sports bar ."
not what i expected .
. it served its purpose .
both on a harley and a vehicle .
good place to watch a game or a fight .
well today we watched a <UNK> <UNK> .

good place to grab a coffee and hangout .
came here last night an hour before closing .
good solid greek restaurant in the westgate area .
this place was very good .
great place to pre drink before a dbacks game .

waiting was not a problem .
probably best friend chicken i ' ve ever had .
very flakey and fried just right .
it be louder and better view of the tv .
red jerk chicken plain with jerked fried rice .
i consider myself a mellow mushroom veteran .
plus the patio at this location rocks .
possibly the best steakhouse in the valley !
not much more to say here .
the wife ordered the kona crusted bone in ribeye .
food took awhile but it was worth it .
i was blown away experience .
0 giant sized tacos good deal for the price .
i will actually return to los reyes .
first of all <UNK> is a tucson area brewery .
great deal for 00 bucks .
the man n cheese pizza stole the show though .
too bad they did not play the game here .
all in all <UNK> is a great place .
lots of tvs around and a huge patio .
. but i still had a good time <UNK> .
looks like they have a stage for music .

the scottsdale location is made from 0 restored houses .
that all i have left to say .
my go to place on the way to tucson .
their moist brisket was excellent and we ordered turkey .
best way to describe it .
the overall layout of the facility is really cool .
there are 0 levels of golf lanes .
what ' s not to like ?
larger tables get two burners .
i prefer the caesar .
add some of their special seasoning .
". best thing , it ' s endless ."
"anyways i give terminal 0 , four stars ."
over 000 craft beers on tap ? ? ok !
plus their hand crafted martinis are on special .
heck anything is really good here .
i ended up ordering a round of pbr .
"just 0 ingredients , freshly squeezed grapefruit and vodka ."
"saw <UNK> , then played a doubles game ."
then saw foosball and had to play .
that explains the ring they <UNK> .
overall a chill cool neighborhood bar .

my wife and i decided to share this time .
cutting calories in half is a good start right ?
all i can say was wow .
but recently came here before a pearl jam concert .
. lots of western influence decorations and tvs inside .
not bad not great .
it was paired wonderfully with the steamed seabass .
anyways i would return here for a special occasion .
awesome deal and thank you yelp !
always clean and good service .
the rooms and decor looked a little generic .
solid breakfast joint on the west side .
"overall good service , good coffee and good food ."

another review on a local brewery .
really hard to do but ph pulled it off .
all i can saw was wow !

of course the burgers are solid .
"big potential , bright future for sure ."
"nothing too hard , 00 minutes is fine ."
i do n't blame the kids up there working .
this is my first review as a yelper .
these guys here at discount tire are amazing .
not much of a car person .
they educated me and gave me guidelines to follow .
their prices and sales for tires here are insane .
"these guys are the best , hands down ."
great choice if you like sushi and seafood .
wait staff was very good .
had the yellowtail sashimi to start and was incredible .
average is the best description here .
country western bar with very attractive servers .
the bar area however is fun .
good beer selection and a great atmosphere .

service was good but the place was empty .
do n't plan on using them ever again .
this place is the best .
they do quality work and deliver as promised .

the video is laughable and so amateur its pathetic .
this place is my favorite place in downtown phx .

freshness is absolutely essential for a successful sushi restaurant .
dinner entrees were surprisingly good .
one of the better finds in vegas .
"for the price and location , hard to beat ."

i bought nearly a thousand dollar <UNK> .
dont come here if youre not white .

i highly recommend associated dentists for their dental services .

as you ' d expect .
the host / hostesses are very friendly and nice .

those birds are swift and dangerous and extremely hungry .
the pasta is good but not the best .

server was named mariah .
ordered pot roast with a side of extra veggies .
setting : typical mexican restaurant theme .
0 out of 0 .
it just does not seem worth the effort .
"omelets , paninis , burritos , and traditional breakfast ."
it was just kind of <UNK> .
i gave them 0 stars based on service alone .
not typical of the fast casual enviroment .
from hot to cold to item of the month .
where they change is in service and cleanliness .
surprise this place was good .
my server was quick and nice .
well the arrogant butcher lives up to its name .
food : chicken stroganoff and short rib stew .

i actually google it to send a case home .
service 0.0 out of 0 .

the other thing is these are properly proportioned meals .

it was very nice for lunch .
i think i fell into the biggest italian <UNK> .
ice tea : very good not bitter or old .
plus they were out of forks and napkins .
i also had a side of chips and queso .
they had a lot of seasoning on them .
at least they are cleaner and have better quality .
i landed here by accident and was <UNK> suprised .
they seem to have a good beer list .
nice that they serve breakfast until 0pm on weekends .
a fryer does not equal seasoning .
while it was huge it was not very good .
the outside ring was <UNK> dry .
the other area they lack is cleanliness .
kudos to what appears as active managers .
the store also has an odd layout .
really nice people and really good food .

roughly double what i pay anywhere else .
never going back to this place .

three mega tacos for five dollars cash .
this buffet is the bomb .
probably the best i ' ve had in vegas .
the restaurants do n't try it .

overall not bad for a free show .
0 stars bc dancers were going through the motions .
this lady is the epitome of miserable .
clean rooms and pool area .

' ' instant photo opportunity .
portions were very large .
the southern <UNK> steak was amazing .
0/0 the hash browns were a disappointment .
. most planet fitness gyms are .
. but not fort mill and rock hill .
and 0 on fridays !
. so i leave the <UNK> .
you guys are really some <UNK> .
you just lost your own money and played yourself .
. they close at 00 .
service is always crap .
"requested a manager , got the omelet remade ."
awesome first impression ... i just left .
suns and coyotes games on tvs everywhere you walk .
marty and dane did a great job .

my girlfriend and i just love this gelato place !
the food is awesome and the ambiance is pleasant .
food is amazing with a excellent variety of spices .

brandon takes service to the next level .
"mike , <UNK> and <UNK> are great servers too !"
the chips were over cooked and tasted like cardboard .
however the tortilla on the burrito was awesome .
as good as it gets .
extremely happy with these guys .
they showed up at my door in 00 .
it is <UNK> food with a <UNK> surrounding .
bill <UNK> is as good as it gets .
"i complained , but nobody seemed to care ."
still the dive it was two years ago .
nobody knew how to run the cash register .
pies were the worst i ' ve ever eaten .
however this is not good for high blood pressure .
they ' ve lost my trust .
"yeah , right ... never happened ."

this place is really great .
the staff are very friendly and knowledgable .
they know there products well .

"try the santa fe benedict , it was great ."
great beer and liquor selection - lots of cocktails .
pretty diverse menu but stick with the pub grub .
we ' ll never use anyone else .
what else is there ?
try great wok instead .
lowes is fine but do not use their contractors .
especially their door installers .
i have to agree with all the reviews .
good spice and the folks are friendly .
never had a bad breakfast there .
an all day meeting .
i had the peking duck which was excellent .
this bob evans was like the others .
good when needing something familiar : - - rrb -
jack and george were extremely knowledgeable and beyond friendly .

recommended for the hispanic who misses mexican food .
"friendly , cheap and delicious ."
one of the worst spots on the strip .
you have been warned .
my wife and i had dinner here .
my wife and i split the prime cap .
the best part of the rib eye .
the wait system is above par .
i went with recommendations by tiffany n . 0 .
everything works well together .
highly recommended for bachelor parties !
"good start , bad finish ."
next dish was the del frisco house salad .
how does an upscale steakhouse allow that to happen ?
perfect amount of marbling for extra fatty juicy goodness .
i like how their stools are 0 feet high .
overall ambiance : hipster .
comparable to tuna in a can ?
i ' m leaning towards that put down .
this place <UNK> that problem .
its over priced burgers gourmet style .
looking for good poutine ?
my wife loved her bagel and cream cheese .
this was one of my favorite stops in montreal .
a rich sauce <UNK> the sweet shrimp within .
- rrb - around the city .
speaking of which ... the buses are decent .
"not in japan , not very big ."
a very good deal and quite filling .
got ta get that quality time in !
really good steaks btw !
forget bj ' s and chicago brew co . .
there ' s better <UNK> in other cities .
was greeted upon arrival .
the food takes about 00 mins to cook .
hustled ! ! false advertisement in the store .
the food was pretty good .
but furniture and trinkets are very interesting .
the service was really quick .
to go orders are always open .
quick and fresh from the kitchen .
service was really quick .
the food was really good as well .
a full plate could satisfy almost customer .
the food was really good and properly cooked .
i heard he beat an iron chef !
you can order the patties cooked to preference so .
the service was outstanding .
this place is <UNK> overpriced .
to top it off automatic gratuity for lousy service .
"despite this , i did n't particularly enjoy it ."
the flavor was bland .
dan <UNK> rocked the joint tonight !
nearby pizza parlor will deliver here .
"- rrb - , and <UNK> ."
thurs . thru sunday serving only breakfast .
you wo n't see it driving by .
of course i ' m talking about <UNK> <UNK> .
like the california chicken <UNK> with avacado .
the ` salted carmel pecan ?
tonight it was wisconsin trout lox & assorted caviar .
you wo n't regret it .
make sure you get here for fat tuesday !
ale smith speedway stout for $ 00 !
good food served quick .
the piã © ce de rã ¨ <UNK> ?
their initial offerings include four <UNK> types of beer .
"on this day , <UNK> bros . ."
happy hour from 0-0 with $ 0 beer specials .
so most people will probably not even notice .
tonight was a seafood chowder .
you pay them for the rooms .
the pool at bellagio at first glance seems nice .
the room was standard in the spa tower .
. inexcusable at any level .
. i guess i do .
review for lunch ... chinese food was ok .
overall the food was good and had decent flavor .
wtf i have a commercial account .
excellent food for the price .
these pops are the absolutely best .
"very refreshing , multiple flavors and not expensive ."
so needles to say i am done with them !
sad place for a cheese steak .
this place is a joke
never coming back to this place ever .
might be the worst seafood i had ever had .
the ceviche seemed likely mostly veggies and little tuna .
entrees were good but lacked flair .
found i clean carpets on yelp .
i have stayed here twice now for work travel .
i will be back soon i hope .
free hot breakfast and social hour in the evening .
old and run down .
always long lines and generally one person running things .
stuffed dates - great flavors and textures .
albondigas - just well done meatballs in marinara .
"with that said , these were a complete disappointment ."
the sausage was dry and not very spicy .
never doing business anymore with them .
the worst mexican place .
changing to a new doctor .
it takes anywhere 00 to half an hour .
this is the worst sushi place .
the best pizza in town .
great service and courteous staff .
no problem checking in early .
low life scum i tell ya .
try the cucumber french !
food was chilis quality .
a little bland for curry though .
i needed the extra salt & japanese mayonnaise .
atmosphere is that of a high end restaurant .
she ' s hella rude .
ordered a shake and waited and waited and waited .
people with shake orders came and went .
finally gave up and left .
this place is an easy 0â 0/0 stars .
"i ordered a <UNK> greek lager , marathon <UNK> ."
wonder why that is ?
visited mesa recently and was nicely suprised .
will be referring them every chance i get .
we had the connecticut and the cajun lobster rolls .
come as you are to stripsteak .
build your own burger .
the most massive burger is the <UNK> .
do n't order this burger .
the price goes down to $ 00 .
i usually order them with a sampler of sauces .
in about 00 minutes it will be thawed .
make a stop here and check it out .
i recommend you try it .
the 00oz ribeye was incredible .
no one has anything else like it .
the selection of restaurants is really top notch .
stripsteak is my favorite steakhouse anywhere .
<UNK> has some amazing sushi offerings .
"anything you purchase , charge it to your room ."
this will rack up points fast .
most likely you will get some good ones .
i ' ve paid as little as $ 00 .
screaming orgasm sauce ... whatever dude .
lame name and nothing special at all .
every time has been a wonderful experience .
service is on top of their game .
the sushi bar is where it is at though .
the food from the kitchen is just ok .
it is a must try if you eat here .
honey pig has some catching up to do .
"now , about the food ."
"but until then , i wont be back ."
"anyways , onto the actual restaurant ."
one of my favorite places in downtown phoenix .
this place is really unique .
but the second time was embarrassing .
"solid burger , kind of pricey though ."
definitely get the <UNK> upgrade for action movies .
also the employee ' s are nice people !
you ' ll never have anything like it again .
this place is great .
what really hurt is the service .
me and my buddies always come here on wednesdays .
"all in all , wings are amazing ."
absolutely worth checking out .
that ' s the game changer .
food here is wonderful .
"a tad pricey , but that ' s fine ."
the absolute best burger i ' ve had .
just ate here for lunch and came away impressed .
i will be back here for sure .
it ' s just as awesome .
maybe the other menu items are better .
"the burger is not bad , not great tho ."
they have a denny ' s downstairs .
seats are big and comfortable .
the appetizers were delicious .
the pizzas were top-notch as well .
luke warm at best .
we had a real good time .
another great place at the venetian is bouchon .
great local indian cuisine in tempe .
this place <UNK> the red rocker ' s name .
my wife had ordered some nachos .
"either way , this place needs to clean house ."
not sure if anyone actually uses airport reviews .
many places were closed .
atmosphere is nice with great decor .
has outdoor patio area .
very spicy but very good .
we could n't even see beyond the roof .
half the <UNK> crust ended up scraped off .
barro ' s is refreshing for us .
the staff put on a great event .
"no reviews ? ? odd , oh well ."
. definately choose <UNK> ' appliance factory service .
i highly recommend dino ' s .
it ' s an airport with sand sculpture animals .
but the food is damn tasty .
everything should be delivered on a sword .
lv photo is very professional .
ca n't go wrong with these guys .
they do an amazing job at a fair price .
nothing great and had been expecting nothing more .
both were very good .
lots of tv to watch football .
hard to get a refill from waitress .
"they were ok , nothing great and nothing bad ."
the breakfast items i saw .
this is one of the better buffets .
remember it ' s buffet food .
the boss loves the crap legs .
the view is fantastic .
"rooms were ok , but a bit dinged up ."
great place to take a stroll through .
great spot and will only get more popular .
the liberty is one of my charlotte staples .
"bbq done right , awesome smokey flavor !"
these guys are top notch .
their prices are reasonable and the folks are friendly .
best bargain in town .
they do a great job at the right price .
thirty day guarantee on repairs and materials .
this is a good buffet .
the food is simple but good .
i ' ll get to that later .
so what ' s not to like ?
the menu is traditional italian .
this makes for a very cozy atmosphere .
any way great non chain pizza .
"great managers , and staff ."
dependable good eats from nc to ga . .
this place was just not good .
the pastas we ordered were very good .
ordered a pizza for pick up <UNK> .
just wanted to try the pizza place .
"but , it is well worth it ."
the food well plated .
this was a big mistake .
my wife and i had a wonderful experience here .
prices are what you would expect on crescent .
would certainly return for another burger .
pinky ' s cafe is an old school diner .
the decor is definitely late 00 ' s .
now for some detail on the food .
it is classic diner breakfast and lunch type stuff .
"omelets , pancakes , hash browns , thick toast ."
this is n't the type of place .
but it is almost like that seinfeld diner episode .
what really makes this station is the music .
the mix of jazz is really good .
wins hands down over the <UNK> !
love the baba <UNK> .
national is the best .
parking is no problem .
thoughts while on the trail : nice short hike .
"what ' s not to like , right ?"
you might have read the other reviews .
the answer is yes it is .
it was the food that was just unacceptable .
"overpriced for sure , but poorly prepared too ."
"sorry guys , you are just not worth it ."
no need to be here hours ahead on departure .
i actually liked the food .
the chips were slightly stale .
the decor is dated and cramped .
two adults sitting <UNK> had better be very friendly .
had the tacos on special .
"sorry , but they earned it ."
i had the three piece spicy catfish .
will be back again .
unfortunately we were seated near the front window ... .
along with an extended family of flies .
this buffet is a couple blocks from my house .
the food was good and hot .
there is a bbq station that was tasty .
"who knows , maybe ignorance is bliss ?"
"bottom line , i will be back ."
a good place for a lunch bite .
housekeeping was good and efficient .
not too smokey or anything like that .
* the little <UNK> restaurant there was awesome .
it ' s not very close to anything .
<UNK> mist and fresh mango poolside .
a great place for a night out .
the negatives : parking is nonexistent .
"however , it turned out my shocks were fine ."
"small donuts , like the name says ."
no waiting but the place was fairly busy .
drink order was a little slow .
food came out fairly quickly and was prepared properly .
overall very good food but pricey .
rock n roll fingers is one of a kind .
the texas toast is nothing short of great either .
stephanie was our waitress and she was fantastic .
fantastic place to eat and drink .
my wife and i enjoyed dinner here recently .
both were well prepared and tasty .
holy crap this place is bomb .
the food is just amazeballs .
it ' s a nasty place .
there original hot <UNK> are good .
want to have a good time ?
it serious is in the middle of the strip .
"nice rooms , great views ."
not overpriced for what you get .
this place is a must go to ! !
i have really been to better steakhouses in vegas .
the food is all ala ` carte and expensive .
they are <UNK> right now .
should be nice and new when it is done .
this business has just opened .
we wish them all of the best of luck .
plenty to do at mccarran .
tons of shops and places to eat .
their produce is hit and miss sometimes though .
this was much better when it opened .
great place for suits and a great price .
i found it quite funny and very true .
i guess the truth hurts - rrb - .
"unfortunately , they could care less ."
the coffee is over rated .
- lrb - next beer is on us maybe ?
nice staff as well .
just got done with lunch here .
newest property on the strip .
awesome water features around the property .
you ca n't go wrong here .
ask for free window stickers when you pay .
the service here is kind of ehhhh .
"very large , and the food is pretty good ."
the food here is really great .
i always get them on wednesday in henderson .
"wow , fausto ' s is good ."
"dinner was , fine , nothing special ."
"newer target , clean store ."
nice people work here .
the people working here could not be more pleasent .
location is now 0000 decatur .
nice big new building .
that is the theme at al ' s garage .
both were most excellent .
the food presentation and quality varies significantly each visit .
the occasion : casual sunday dinner at the bar .
great service and incredible food .
my only gripe is the story time for kids .
the worst drive-thru ever .
probably waited much longer than i did .
let me start by saying that i am argentine .
i will be back for sure .
"$ 000 later , i went to inspect ."
"after 0 , they showed up ."
avoid at all costs .
the food here was cheap and awful .
i would not recommend this food to anyone .
this place is amazing .
great food outstanding beer .
even the music stands out .
went in at 000 pm .
well so much for that .
bartender was new and was not on her game .
food was standard italian fare .
- lrb - a bit pricy - rrb - .
so a bit misleading .
but still it got me in the door .
wine list was excellent .
you should definitely go see them .
no air filters to c anywhere .
great little dive bar .
outstanding margaritas on special .
the place and her were both a mess .
the place and her were both a mess .
this place will be closed very shortly i believe .
hot tea upon arrival .
as was the ox tongue appetizer .
on past occasions it was better .
- lrb - july 0 - rrb - .
watch out for these guys .
they tell you $ 00 for oil change .
this place was great .
coffee with french press was nice .
the food actually was not that bad .
however the service was deplorable .
service at the bar is ok .
huge room with an oversized deck .
fun place with a lot of potential .
probably one of the best burgers in town .
fries are good also .
the service is deplorable .
and the prices are out of this world .
and then $ 00 for a burger .
well this place has both of those challenges met .
and the drink list is pretty extensive .
that ' s too high .
it was cooked correctly though .
for a new place to try and attract locals .
from top to bottom .
if your organization is in need of training .
definitely reach out to tom and <UNK> at prism .
i highly recommend these guys .
the entire staff was terrific .
to then begin treatment within fifteen minutes after that .
a bit pricey though .
pork belly is not as good as advertised .
still the best after all these years .
although the service was outstanding .
do not ever order the filet .
just an awful piece of meat .
i am on he fence about returning .
"great sandwiches , clean and friendly place ."
"but it was ok , dj played nice sound ."
thats not really customer friendly .
i will return to this place .
nice diffrent burgers to try .
the service was very friendly and helpful .
"nice decoration , style and <UNK> look ."
i <UNK> d the beer tasting .
you can <UNK> between several beers .
- flat screen tv ' s galore .
shower warmed ok pressure .
long walk or short cab ride to the strip .
variety of restaurants inside the casino .
be prepared to pay a resort fee .
room has an old clock and a <UNK> tv .
price $ $ overall free parking and internet .
a resort fee will be added at checkout .
oh yeah i forgot to mention !
what happened to this place ?
and to match the water damaged door .
probably the worst cirque show i have seen .
i guess i was wanting to see more <UNK> .
yeah it added to the experience .
the hotel room i stayed in is old .
the carpet is dirty and stained .
i would give this denny ' s 0 stars .
more like 0.0 stars .
the eureka casino is a nice family run casino .
even the security guards will bring you a drink .
finally a true okonomiyaki joint .
not the premade frozen crap you find at <UNK> .
i could n't not find anything if i tried .
nice little shop in squirrel hill .
nice texture and good amount of flavor .
enter cool ice <UNK> in pittsburgh .
reminds me of old school neighborhood ice cream shoppes .
the place was empty except for us .
that is spirit airlines .
truly the worst u . s . airline .
no problem i thought ; it happens .
that took another 00 minutes .
do n't fly spirit airlines .
very easy access to a car .
always a good variety of choices .
they were okay working with during the lease period .
"two hours later , nobody shows up ."
spicy addition to the classic .
friendly fast and educational .
"awesome staff , very knowledgeable , and attractive ."
he did excellent work .
great service thank you kelly .
chef marc is great .
ca n't go wrong with the food or atmosphere .
this is cheap pizza with cheap ingredients .
they brought their drivers license .
they spend money on an uber back and forth .
nice place for drinks .
best lunch choice in the area .
close to the river and bicycle path .
they still serve breakfast and lunch though .
the steak quesadilla is excellent also .
i have had pizza delivered twice now .
great food and good price .
the spam <UNK> is good if you like spam .
i ' m probably 00 % thru the menu .
"close , but never over the edge ."
probably just to the store bought <UNK> stuff .
"gee whiz , this place is <UNK> ."
"it was most fantastic , must order ."
"so last nite , same deal ."
and that ' s saying a lot .
"food-wise , i like : the samosas ."
cheese and no cheese options are available .
"<UNK> , why do you hate vegans so much ?"
the <UNK> burger - somewhat less so .
unremarkable but well cooked home fries .
valet is n't one of those places .
"for awhile , i swore off <UNK> <UNK> ."
their desert cookies are also quite good .
"great simple site with good , accurate <UNK> ."
nice efficient bike shop on rachel near st denis .
so yeah - <UNK> .
"totally worth it , dudes ."
pickup on saturday morning was not a problem .
the attention to detail on the cake and 0 .
one of the best <UNK> in las vegas .
classes available in the morning and evening .
trevor and josh are excellent trainers .
they will get you fit in short time .

tip : go at night .
pin kaow is a great thai restaurant .
it was excellent here .
"such a funky , cool vegas spot ."
its in a strip mall next to a chevron .
yeah that ' s right .
they must have taken notes during the reservation .
the table was already set with silverware and menus .
the hush puppies were ok .
both dishes were cooked well and tasted good .
the country fried steak was a real disappointment .
the white pepper gravy was tasteless and gelatinous .
"good idea , bad execution ."
a bit unprofessional if you ask me .
"anyways , everything is handwritten with no pos system ."
tlc wings next door does just fine .
"owners were horrible , food and service sucked ."
inconsistency is also a problem .
the food is just too good to resist .
"go early , no cover , great drink specials ."
quite possibly the best burger i ' ve had .
it could have easily cost $ 00 anywhere else .
best bargain in vegas .
' ' ... $ 00 ' ' she says .
"not great , not bad ."
you are the breakfast of champions .
nathan definitely works hard to keep his audience entertained .
first time i tried a place like this .

this place is a dump .
great experience for the whole family .
pollo fundido was excellent .
great family friendly and fun place to eat .
not the most visit location but worth it .
i recommend the <UNK> rolls !
"great food , live jazz tonight inside ."
. no notice of anything .
avoid uptown at all costs .
great food for good price !
you have to try the rare tuna .
perhaps the worst mainstream club in vegas .
however this was a good place to start .
there is 0 ice machine per floor .
really one machine for a casino this big ?
there advertising is deceiving .
i have no complaints about this place .
. also the prices are unbeatable .
"great service from the waiter , scott ."
<UNK> not as plentiful or generous as previous visits .
"always great steaks , pasta , everything ."
"management is great , but <UNK> ."
too bad - used to be a good place .

great place dj <UNK> is awsome ! ! !
very professional and the rooms look great !
it was incredible watching these huge balloons fill up .
"awesome food , tv , computers , coin displays ."
. the sushi freak is amazing .
their cocktail shrimp were relatively larger than other buffets .
"hands down best , biggest , buffet in vegas ."
if covers are <UNK> thats a shame .
what can you say about the <UNK> club ?
all the pasta here is good .
costumer service is nonexistent .
"the rooms are cheap , <UNK> , and cheap ."
no further explanation was given .
good beer is not enough .
came here during a business trip in pittsburgh .
nothing else really stood out .
the place is clean and the staff is friendly .
the coffee was fine .
enjoyed lunch and this was my first visit .
both were very good and the ingredients were fresh .
food is the best and beer is cold .
' ' i had the filet mignon .
i asked for medium rare and received it .
they are big enough for a meal .
the doughnut desert was very fun .
the food arrived with flourish .
descriptions and accountability were excellent .
i assured him that it was excellent .
somewhat unbelievable grace under fire .
bearnaise is not an easy sauce .
having no idea what i should try .
one funny thing did happen .
a few moments later the emergency lights came on .
a fuse was blown on the cappuccino machine .
' ' those words are inaccurate .
there are no accidents .
how hard is it to take an order correctly ?
this place was new and exciting in container park .
not worth the money .
bad drinks and equally bad overpriced food .
that wouldnt be possible without <UNK> .
this was my first experience with 00rd express .
i concur with the buttermilk pie reviews .
thanks yelpers for this hole in the wall find .
"the rib eye medium is perfect , completely perfect ."
quality from the bottom to the top .
<UNK> is not this kinda place .
all were typical vietnamese fashioned food .
as noted soda selection is huge .
sometimes i need to manage my expectations with yelp .
the pizza is peter piper esque .
the golden sauce did taste good .
the place has dealership prices plus heavy mark ups .
i know some people love the food here .
stick with the munchies at this post 000 retreat .

and it turned out great .
and these onion rings are pretty damn decent .
update : the onion rings are all gone !
no explanation for the delay .
the garden is extremely well-kept and is easily <UNK> .
the zinburger is great .
too many <UNK> certain times of the year .
nice view of the city .
too rock to run this without <UNK> your ankles .
it costs money to park .
maybe that is why so many people love it .
trying that acai bowl ... giving the .
not too long of a hike .
nice view of the city .
the food its fine if you are a guy .
they do great at what they do .
maybe if you grew up with this ?
this location has always had good service .
really good food actually .
better than quiznos or subway .
0 stars is about right .
its decent food for a decent price .
it was good food well made .
not greasy like a lot of other places .
very loud and uncomfortable .
that should tell you all you need to know .
once again my wife will give this 0 stars .
the only reason not to is lines and cost .
sw airlines is my favorite airline .
the staff is positive all the time .
the only downside in an otherwise amazing business .
"good staff , great facility ."
my wife loves this place .
- rrb - live music on fridays .
a grand old mansion with lots of interesting rooms .
grimaldi ' s is good stuff well made .
"not crazy cool , average ."
the only downside of this place is the wait .
"also , great atmosphere ."
"nice people , fast service ."
very comfortable place to eat .
not sure why they are n't famous .
they are famous with me .
this is one of those mormon chains .
i guess its too many calories or something .
this one seems to be managed well .
garages are <UNK> with elevators at each end .
make sure to take down the number .
very good for buffet pizza !
"great desert pizza , nice staff , clean ."
decent price for what you get .

why review a mcdonald ' s ?
top t is right this guy is awesome .
i ' ll miss that dude .
my wife feels exactly the same .
good service fast service good product .
"cool firehouse theme , great food , good service ."
that ' s really all you need to know .
maybe atmosphere helps the food taste better ?
even the corn on the cobb is fantastic .
these guys did n't blink .
everything was exactly as it should be .
my favorite place to run in arizona .
some great runs and you can pick your distance .
the trails are well marked .
but the trails are great .
huge portion sizes and traditional sit down mexican food .
nothing about this place seems ` ` wow !
chicago style deep dish is great .
but was great food .
great stating in front .
how do you do that at panda ?
do n't go to africa first !
"classic chain restaurant , but they do it right ."
been coming here for decades .
new more upscale feel is better for adults .

"this place is definitely worth trying ,"
owner wo n't sell .
lovely bar with great local craft beers and spirits .
very happy with the service from doc ' s .
me and tony are like kings .
service is top notch and bar none .
service matched the food quality .
stay away from these guys .
i elected to have them replaced anyway .
total cost for all repairs came to $ 000.00 .

$ 000 to replace it .
my brake pads and rotors were replaced approx .
the estimate to repair was slightly over $ 000.00 .

really nice place with great service .
tokyo lobby is an overall good choice .
this place is great for bbq .

the arizona burrito is amazing !
not to mention the polar slide .
great juice selection as well .
the main reason i come back ?

pretty darn good vietnamese food .
nice appetizers including fresh rolls and fried rolls .

i just returned from the dump .
- the casino itself was awesome .
i kind of felt cooler for staying there .
i wonder how long its been up there for .
this is second bad experience at cartel .
very helpful and professional .
very rude male agent .
any issues talk to customer service .
can i give it a zero ?
well worth the time and cost .
chicken strips cooked perfectly .
"tangy bbq sauce has a little kick , excellent ."
onion rings are vey good .
bob creates sports specific training .
he trains our wrestling team as <UNK> for wrestling .

the special was life changing .
great service and good food .
later grew to 00 and then down to 00 .
the staff was understanding and eager to accommodate .

our waiter stephen was very attentive .
they just do n't have the truck part .

all they had was an suv .
go to hell man .

the staff is professional and courteous .
the service is always a step above .
this la fitness is convenient and inexpensive .
this restaurant is the bomb .
six bucks for a juice ?

it seems like nothing is ever on sale .
overall i recommend it .
they must have been facing towards a wall instead .
its a total hit .
life at zipps is life well spent .
went here today and this place was great .
only real criticism is the drive thru line .
half price bottles of wine on mondays and tuesdays !
i think the guy i worked with was gary ?
"having said that , the patio is a joke ."
do n't bother with that .
much better atmosphere there .
we will see what they are like next time .
a great pick me up .
i am a pita junkie for pita jungle .
rotating chalk art on a giant chalk board ?

an amazing restaurant if you are a burger fan .

this place brings love back into food .
booths are also a bit tight .
been going here for years .

service and price was inline with our needs .
go find out for your self .
it has worked flawlessly .
this is a great company with a great product .
who gets that business ?
both times it was the highlight of the trip .
think twice however about sitting in the front row .
the highlight was the <UNK> southwest bistro .
my hotel room was large and clean .
our server melinda was fantastic .
our most recent server anne marie was a delight !
i would actively avoid their sushi .
they came up anyway .
the drinks ... expensive but weak .
took an hour to get in .
now onto the experience .
it is literally acres of party .
there ' s even gambling .
app said 00 minute wait once i arrived .
no big deal but a little disappointing .
lots and lots of <UNK> .
try the duck fat fries and sauces .
"fettucini alfredo is <UNK> , great service ."
great food and service .
unless you mind a long walk all the time .
must get the osso bucco and the creamed corn .
they have some great specials .
spectacle at every turn .
the drinks are top notch .
mojitos excellent mixed in classic island style .
that sounded like it described what i saw .
it is absolutely impossible to sleep through .
hopefully the management can up their game .
been here a few times .
consistent quality and quantity .
best mexican food experience next to home cooked .
nice atmosphere and super service from the staff .
rice and beans are pretty bland and tasteless .
i ' ll be back .
the management appears nonexistent .
' ' i ordered the $ 000 menu .
requested some ginger to cleanse the pallet .
"steamed mussels are well , steamed mussels ."
"for what i recieved , this place fell flat ."
the meat was still flavorful and super juicy .
the thing bringing it down is their customer service .
long time plateau resident .
this is one of my favourite destinations .
i really like the place .
i had to leave the car over the weekend .
update : this place is under new management now .
the app ' s i tried were very good .
. so yeah 0 stars all day .
eat at your own risk .
all for ~ 00 bucks a person .
great service and quality work .
in two words : worth it .
both chinese entrees were pretty unimaginative .
xs all the way .
i was just here again on sat 00-00 .
the assistant manager stopped by and introduced himself .
my wife ordered the tuscan seafood stew .
this is where it gets worse .
great <UNK> breakfast place .

their clubhouse is honestly second to none .
the course had a fine layout .
especially in the landing areas from your tee shot .

"quietly , a bargain on the strip ."
the service is rather shaky .
the course is in great shape .

went back the next day and had the benedict .
"a step down , and a generous three stars ."
the rooms are <UNK> .
today i got to finally try a claim jumper .

cool waiter saved this from being a total disaster .
hit your targets and score .
none of it was very good .
but the chicken was surprisingly solid .
the restaurants are average to below average .
i washed down the meal with a stone ipa .
the enchilada had their signature rotisserie chicken inside .
the wifey had the macho salad .

the s'mores brioche doughnuts were the shit !
but the donuts stole the show !
i will be back for the main course .

obviously freshly ground beef .
the room has two <UNK> .

just some constructive criticism .
atomic liquor - the oldest bar in las vegas .
0 $ for <UNK> beer .
that means only one method of preparation .
the fake crab salad is awesome .
maple syrup should be applied generously to the beans .
also worth a mention is the homemade meat pie .
the north has snow covered mountains .
i really enjoyed staying at the downtown grand .
price was great on weekdays .
"the food was ok , along with the service ."
"girlfriend had the chile relleno , same bland taste ."
great time friendly staff .
this place is a lot better than the tavern .
ca n't wait till they start to brew beer .
not many places do that .
from the decor to the food was top notch .
hand crafted beer is a plus .
the house is 00 degrees ... not the band .
save your bag for the next move .
you get 0 <UNK> for a dollar .
they could <UNK> their draft selection some .
the low score is all about service .
if you have never been here then stay away .
why do n't they told me upfront ?
thank you sparks family medicine .
"if your looking for something authentic , go here ."
if you need a dr look no further .
this place is off the charts !
not sure what that is all about .
"ok , ok ... you get the point ."
the guy that owns this place is a genius !
i will be going back tomorrow for lunch .
just had 0 beers for 00 bucks .

fusion places are a bad idea ... .

it cuts in and out all of the time .
they change your speeds all of the time .
i pay 00 a month for inconsistent service .
cox service still does n't work right .
i did call a head .
the staff seems unfriendly and the establishment felt uninviting .
the sarcastic truth <UNK> .
p . s . check the restaurant inspection report .
then my excitement faded .
nothing tastes the same .
is n't there a recipe ?
you can feel the difference .
no care or attention to detail .
not like i would eat there either but still .
sorry if this is harsh but by <UNK> .
clean an lots of variety .
now for the specifics .
the sarcastic truth <UNK> .
very nice staff truly a feel good place !

a while later the food was delivered .
pad thai you say ?
she cuts me off .
sorry to be a bother as a paying customer .
"cold , over cooked and over spiced ."
"cool , great , not real limes ."
was a good place .
you walk to the counter ... kinda like chipotle .
cuz cuz cuz i said so .
if you like good coffee skip it .
a reliable haven right in the middle of downtown .
it is 0:00 pm when i got here .
this place was pretty good .
generous portions inside both the cowgirl and philly roll .
i recommend the chef <UNK> as a small appetizer .
only downside to this place is it is byob .
not your normal baklava .
i chalked it up to maybe a miscommunication .
very different than anything else in pittsburg .
grit & grace lives up to the 0 stars .
busy on a saturday as you would expect .
the atmosphere was hipster / industrial .
food : think tapas before showing up .
"some items are very small , some are medium ."
the 0 dim sum options we tried were good .
the pork belly stole the show .
dim sum = $ 0 each .
good value at that price .
just be ready for the similarities in taste .
shaved flank steak : the steak was great .
they seem to excel when it comes to pork .
we have been about 0 times .
drinks : good price .
the make the best old fashions in town .
they could charge more and it would pay .
the wife bought the fried chicken and waffles .
the real hero was the syrup .
the service was outstanding .
the gentlemen knew his stuff and was attentive .
the alaskan king crab was outstanding .
the shrimp wrapped in bacon was the worst value .
i would avoid this as tasty as it sounds .
the spinach pie was ok .
my wife got the lamb kabob .
the cheese pie was pretty bad .
so ultimately would i give it another shot ?

i was there for a cardinals game .
"great service , nice decor inside ."
add it to the list .
but make sure you pick the right one .
ordered the pierogis and kielbasa and it was awesome .
"the presentation could ' ve been better , too ."
parking is on the street .
the crowd is laid back and friendly .
the restaurant has confidence .
the ambiance remains excellent .
great view of the city .
i would guess most people share that belief .
i tasted both an ipa and a wheat beer .
great coffee house in a great neighborhood .
and what do you think this is ?
of course they give you a little attitude .
"food , service , location - - all great ."
fantastic selection of women ' s clothes .
we had the pork belly which was very good .
notion closed before i could visit .
"great service , great experience ."
"great , affordable lunch spot in the area ."
it ' s never too late .
lackluster would be an <UNK> .
my girlfriend is not a big fan .
"i would instead call it , ` mexican themed ."
got the garbanzo bean stew and the taquitos .
and it has the other two machines .
"either way , you ca n't go wrong ."
it was truly excellent .
"so why only , ` a-ok ' ?"
service was good and the salsa was spicy .
first visit was interesting .
got some <UNK> history on the way .
"slow internet speeds , despite what is advertised ."
break them up now .
why go anywhere else ?
get the mexican chocolates .
my personal fave is the salt & pepper bar .
"this is good , <UNK> indian food ."
"it makes everything more , well , civilized ."
i agree with the comments posted by others .
i just made my first trip to park bruges .
the selection of belgian beers was more than adequate .
did n't eat but the food looked good .
burgers and fries are excellent .
but the korean barbeque was outstanding .
probably the best i ' ve had .
why not a five star ?
so no big scene .
location is excellent and the staff nice .
another great option in squirrel hill .
excellent local bar in a great location .
best feature : the polish food .
the atmosphere is casual and the service nice .
you got ta go .
wife got a yellow curry .
best part was the pork buns .
great place to hang out .
who runs out of potatoes during breakfast .
so again today sunday the 0nd of november .
my tastebuds were doing the truffle shuffle !
everything from the wasabi to the rolls was fantastic .
i took my wife for date nite .
amazing spot for libations and delicious cuisine .
the crew was very efficient and friendly .
. call perfectly <UNK> .
great food great service and a down home feel .
will be back in oct on my way east .
wife got poke salad .
the wife got the loco moco .
the wife ordered a strawberry margarita .
wife ordered chicken enchiladas with mole .
i ordered a 0 item combo .
. the relleno was a little bit over fried .
soft like a enchilada .
the bacon flavor just permeates throughout the loaf .
my wife has a fondness for the feta bread .
tivoli village is very dog friendly .
the counter help was terrific .
you get alot of food .
nothing more than $ 0 .
i had the general tso ' s chicken .
fried rice was non-descript .
my wife got the side salad .
a definite favorite place for gyros .
went for brunch with my wife .
"service was typical , <UNK> and largely disinterested ."
really closer to two stars but that feels harsh .
"good job , gentlemen ."
silly me to doubt his judgement .
eos is <UNK> grub at a reasonable price .
"the bread at earls , though , is awesome ."
here is a business well worth supporting .
i was amused by the carving station .
deep dish chocolate chip cookies ?
how about apple cobbler ?
- rrb - it was cool .
"turn the lights up a little , will ya ?"
but overall great food and value .
tried the surf and turf burger with bacon .
"burger was good , maybe a little underseasoned ."
lobster was a tad bit over cooked .
the kicker on this burger was asparagus .
not too expensive for a celebrity chef joint .
lots of tvs for your sports viewing pleasure .
its a tad bit overpriced .
got a table with no problem .
went here for a bachelor party dinner .
the lobster bisque had an incredibly dense lobster flavor .
there were only two downsides .
lots of fancy rolls along with the basics .
drinks were ok but nothing special .
had a good time here .
the rooms are small with no desk or couch .
"pros : cool setup , nice pool and bar ."
"good dj and music , good staff ."
"they blamed opentable , whatever ."
this was just ripoff central .
"chicken was dried out , sides were meh ."
"nothing special , no great decor , nothing <UNK> ."
nothing to justify the cost of the meal .
"not * great * confit , but not bad ."
let me open with : perfect service .
"no standout dishes , nothing memorable , nothing great ."
proceed at your own risk .
what does the fox say ?
dont desk with this nonsense .
highly recommend these guys !
this place is awesome .
you ' ll thank me later !
they heated the place up .
i saw dead ones everywhere .
we call you guys up .
i have the warranty .
which is the only thing that kills the eggs .
i would n't use these guys .
these guys mean business .
i ' ve been going here for years .
awesome visit after all .
best breakfast in the valley .
food was much better the first time .
the service is extremely poor .
dry <UNK> food with no service of any kind .
my poor significant other was n't so lucky .
"if not , stay away ."
you want ice in your drink ?
good lord this place serves a ton of food .
too much build up ?
"cheap , friendly , and ridiculously good ."
came here with my future bro in law .
ordered the red velvet pancakes and the loco moco .
and the loco moco was the biz !
patty and egg cooked just right .
it ' s now 00 minutes past .
she just takes it back without any apology again .
i had the lamb burger .
i ordered it medium temp .
come on ... that ' s amateur .
always a fun place to meet good friends .
everything was great and the service was excellent .
i recommend the pita burgers and spicy fries .
very nickel and dime .
kill a prostitute ... nope !
i am getting pizza from a 00s pizza place !
yelp reviews made this place sound neat .
the place has no ventilation .
0 stars and i am under 00 years old !
you can not go wrong here .
that ' s all you need .
"sure t ` ing , cous ."
then laughter ... aloha <UNK> !
the service is top notch here !
or off the strip .
gimmicky celebrity <UNK> dealers !
"ca n't be simply <UNK> , only <UNK> ."
"to the left , a closet for the throne ."
frozen chocolate dipped cheesecakes .
pints of coffee ice cream .
grand lux is by no means a <UNK> bistro .
just north of $ 00 .
so i ' m told .
' ' so i ' m told .
so i ' m told .
so i ' m told .
button or collar ' d shirts all around though .
... the lack of female audience .
... its far away from <UNK> everything .
do you really need more reason ?
the big minus stars for this timeshare resort ?
"great nickname for a climbing gym staffer , right ?"
c'est tres <UNK> ... !
the other amenities cater to your basic needs .
- lsb - <UNK> review - rsb - food ?
0 stars ... one ... liter ... beers .
i had two in about a half hour .
you said i must be used to eating sausage .
0 liters of <UNK> .
one <UNK> and sauerkraut sandwich .
` ` hey there ... ' ' she <UNK> .
` ` <UNK> ... i always do ... you ?
and beer ... we also thought of beer .
"` ` yes , please ."
what a perfect way to ease into the crazy .
i ' ll be back .
i ' ll definitely return .
this place has terrible everything .
"very good food , great service and reasonably priced ."
this guy is incredible .
looking forward to trying everything eventually .
finally found a buffet worse than city buffet .
how do these places stay in business ?
the city buffet is even worse .
i would n't even call it chinese food .
they told me they do n't use mayonnaise .
have n't been there in 00 years .
i had an urge for some roasted chicken .
a bit pricey but very good food .
cox cable tv is almost as bad .
on friday they had a really good steak deal .
yesterday ended all that .
there were no other customers there at 00:00 am .
"i said ok , show me the leak ."
all three times the table service was lousy .
this is now my new subway store of choice .
do n't know what its like now .
ball joints were good .
nothing on google or their web site .
"tacos are 0.00 each , burritos are 0.00 each ."
burrito not worth the price .
just got back from my trip from vegas .
beer - mediocre selection .
phenomenal fresh fare with amazing service .
i highly recommend the giant <UNK> advanced .
full carbon with full <UNK> components .
the <UNK> brakes are bullet proof .
best tip i have ever had .
"amazing food , fresh , always plentiful ."
smoker allowed on the outdoor patio .
terribly slow service tonight which was our first visit .
"food , acceptable , not remarkable ."
. in reality they are not .
salads were average ar best .
news is not enjoyable .
<UNK> should be sports or nothing .
i will say that they had three televisions .
the service was very good .
i had chicken fried chicken .
the cream corn lacked flavor .
my partner had pot roast which was also lukewarm .
it was a very good choice .
i ' ll definitely return .
i have it with the vegetables .
you got ta have the veggies .
the service is great .
next time i ' ll be adventurous .
i usually have the bbq pizza which is great .
i ' m not so sure about the grits .
the fries were good also .
i hear they are building a new place .
i am not a fan of the gumbo .
maybe it was a bad day .
"my therapist , sara , does the same ."
friendly service ... fast service ... sandwich was awesome .
the burger was seasoned well and very tasty .
the bun was even better than the burger .
the fries were tasty .
there is one huge negative about this place .
i ' ve gone here for years .
it was too hot .
i ' m a fan .
priced rather high i think .
: - - rrb - the pizza was good .
it was really quite comical .

my partner had the chicken tortilla soup .
it seemed as if it was tomato based .
the bean dip was ok .
the beef tacos were made from shredded beef .

so why the five stars ?

my partner got the ribs .
the grilled asparagus was a pleasant surprise .
it helps to have an idea .

i consider three stars a safe visit .
it was a average restaurant .
the chicken enchiladas were ok .
my partner said that his chimichanga was ok .
ultimately what happened was an inedible bowl .
the grits are not too soupy either .
yes ! ! ! blue bell ice cream .
the end result was awesome .
"for that , i would expect a half rack ."
"anyway , back to walker ."
the process the next day took about 00 minutes .
management has really improved .
the show was awesome .
the acoustics are awesome .
it took us thirty minutes to depart the showroom .
what was the problem ?
the venetian wants to make money .
heaven forbid someone gets sick in that crowd .
that situation has to be against fire code .
what more can i say ?
the food was very good .
they were both very good .
what a great find .
the service was excellent .
the food was amazing .
i had the mochiko bowl .
the servings are plentiful .
it has the feel of a diner .

then came the meal .
the collards were superbly cooked and seasoned .
that ' s not bbq chicken .
overall ... a solid four and maybe 0.0 stars .

the chicken itself was good and moist .
we live over 00 miles away .
that was a good start .
they had bottomless coffee that tasted really good .
the bacon and eggs were not anything special .
the service was excellent .
the choices of food are extremely varied .
they were just ok actually .
the collard greens were perfect .

"great food , fair prices ."
awesome place to eat !
they treat you as you ' re family .
great beer and liquor selection .
<UNK> whisky behind the bar .
the best coffee spot in charlotte period .
very very very good barbeque .
side salad is shockingly good for a bbq joint .
rooftop deck and occasionally local bands .
it was disappointing to the point of being comical .
' ' i ordered the new york strip .
"good , but nothing special ."
i even asked them if the fries were frozen .
they assured me they make them by hand daily .
"again , good but nothing special ."
my wife ordered the brisket which was good .
even if it comes from a goat .
the arcade comedy theater is a rare gem .

taste of greece right here in phoenix .
very happy with my experience at lone spur cafe .

vegas is the devils playground by the way .
the heat was nice though .
it is a good pizza / wing joint to .
lots of local unlv crowd which is good .
it is worth going by .
the sweet tea was also very good .
this time i had chicken fried steak meal .

i highly recommend central .
the food was awesome .
on that count it ' s awesome .
had the pastrami sandwich and it was good .
ingredients were just average .

raucous crowd - all drinking good imported german beer .
the food was classic german and was very good .
they were above average .
my wife order <UNK> enchiladas and they were tasty .
"lasagna was well constructed , sauce was average ."
generally this was a good experience .
we went to ichiban ' s for lunch .
for appetizers my wife and i ordered spring rolls .
"they were hot and crisp , but bland ."
my pork was a very solid entree .
overall a very solid meal .
0 pepperoni and 0 sausage and mushroom .
let ' s start with the pepperoni .
no flavor or texture .
my biggest complaints lie in the sauce and construction .
the sauce was bland and flavorless .
also both pizzas were impossible to eat .
pizza is a <UNK> event .
the hot dog and the bun .
also the bun just kinda sucks .
"as for the toppings , they are fantastic ."
the dog and the bun .
this is n't a mexican taco place .
smoke is its own genre .
bring cash and your own booze .
one of the secrets of smoke is the wings .
"smoked then fried , these are spicy and awesome ."
how hard is it to erase a chalk board ?
no apologies or acknowledgment of an issue were given .
onto the good stuff .
the wings are some of the best in town .
fried crisp and sauced properly .
"bottom line , i ' ll come back ."
even if they suck .
so the max you could eat is 00 wings .
the wings do not come with celery .
apparently this was a bad choice .
when my meal did arrive everything was cold .
this one just does n't cut the mustard .
that should say it all .
the free popcorn and peanuts were a nice touch .
this is not <UNK> .
it ca n't be that bad right ?
the brisket was a mess .
big jim ' s makes it worth investigating .
take the time to get to the run .
this place is pittsburgh .
the simple food and simple people .
there have been a lot of complaints about smoking .
now to my review .
eggs and beers after a hard nights work .
the smash was just what i wanted .
the octopus dish had both .
"decent mats , clean balls and accessible hours ."
this place has none of them .
worn and thread bare .
it is still light out .
finally lets you have the pit to hit into .
there is no grass on the range .
"bottom line , this place sucks ."
negatives : long lines during clubbing nights .
"healthy , light , and relatively guilt free ."
it was decent and the food arrived promptly .
00oz of wonderfully seasoned juicy angus steak .
all you can eat baby !
what ' s the hold up ?
you wo n't be disappointed .
the service was very professional and informed .
every seat had speakers built in .
go to use their cool bathroom tents .
as vegas should be .
the service is on-point .
the menu has not changed much over the years .
their <UNK> : <UNK> ' .
and the selection of dipping sauces for my steak .
do n't change a thing .
impressive sound system on the outdoor deck .
"traditional , classic american steakhouse chain ."
"the short ribs were good , but unremarkable ."
"overall , thoughtful , professional service ."
great view of the vip and the floor .

exactly how prime beef should be !
my companion ' s sea bass was equally delicious .
berry tarte and <UNK> <UNK> .
i ' ll make it back before too long .
"friendly , efficient servers , great entrees ."
north central phoenix is home to some great <UNK> .

the <UNK> screams biker or grease monkey .
this place was highly unique .
the lobby looks great .
the rooms are a little out dated .
all in all not bad .
"00 dollar drinks , ok crowd , totally overhyped ."
the different types of fries are also good .
"as well , the service is sometimes off ."
great thin crust and really fine flavor .

"lunch for 0 , thursday before christmas ."
brisket a little dry was only flaw .
good chips and watery salsa served upon being seated .
"this was beef and peppers , in a tortilla ."
"long beer list , though no heineken ."
sad to see it go down hill .
a little expensive but well worth it .
"great prices , great selection , great atmosphere ."

the price was really more than reasonable .
this place does not exist anymore .
. why do not you remove it from yelp ?
enjoy your stay and food .

. atmosphere and waitress was great .
"diana , olivia , gloria , <UNK> and mark ."

"not a call , not the estimate , nothing ."
the appetizer we got was very good .
i can not fault the restaurant for this though .
the place is awesome .
this place was amazing .
highly suggest the fat cat burger .
however that is not what pittsburgh is about .
staff is also very friendly .
this one is in desperate need of a renovation .
generous portions as well as good sauces available table-side .

my wife did not like their seafood linguini .
much better than bellagio .
the butter on the fresh bread is amazing .
it makes hometown buffet ' s like frozen food .
my wife ordered the braised short ribs .
"i ordered the double eagle , a 00oz steak ."
it was cooked exactly what a medium should be .
it was a good cut and full of flavor .
highly highly recommend the pan fried .
they also have beer specials for cheap after 0am .
the past couple times have been awful .
the standard studio is large and well furnished .
she settled for some heavenly french onion soup .
very nice with coffee .
this is the essence of bistro fair right ?
"disappointed , but overall still a nice experience ."
first positive was no cover charge in vegas .
there is a nice selection of beer on tap .
always nice when i can get dead guy ale .
five stars is not enough for this restaurant .
ranks with the french laundry and <UNK> .
prive is by far the worst .
bottom line ... stay away from prive .
great deal for really high quality breakfast .
"but all this is local stuff , right ?"
but the result felt out of touch with madison .
the menu seems <UNK> instead for ease and <UNK> .
this alone should contribute to an atmosphere of authenticity .
but it ' s the epitome of hit-or-miss .
i ca n't speak highly enough about this place .
pros : good food but just shy of great .
"service was pretty good , no complaints ."
i had the ribeye .
the place needs a manager .

"anyways , on to the hot dog ."
first off it was cold .

that was just all part of the show .
yes most of the tricks were pretty hokey .
it is what it is .
the first thing you come upon are the dolphins .
past the dolphins are the rest of the animals .
you get what you pay for at the luxor .
a lot of lint in there .

they close at 0 pm !
either way avoid this place .

grading the pizza here .

i found it with a smith enterprise <UNK> .
"i had a burger , fries and a shake ."
i ' ve eaten here a few times .

"a classic landmark in middleton , wi ."
i ' ve been here several times .
this hotel looks a lot better than it smells .
surprised that this meets the starwood standard .
not much for a first impression .

i also tipped ea .
this is a bit of a mixed review .
toppings were ample and the crust was tasty too !
they said it would be 0 minutes .
"overall , the pizza quality and taste was excellent ."
the waitress said she would be right back .
"he , himself , was nobu trained ."
your palette will thank you over and over again .
my insurance approved 00 % payment .
000 % up front ?
very poor service in this area .
technology in the room is <UNK> art 0000 .
an alarm clock from 0000 .
food and beverage options : watered down drinks .
a checkin / checkout system that <UNK> on chaos .
make a beeline for the noodle bar .

possibly the best thai restaurant in phoenix .
a substantial improvement over the previous ownership .
"well , my voice message was not returned either ."
"sound was good , drink prices were n't bad ."

lots of variety and price is average .
doughnuts are probably the best thing ever invented .

overall it was below average comparatively .
but the steak was very good .

great place and a nice place to hang out .
so i highly recommend you try that one instead .
me : how much are a dozen ?
jared : what size ?
"good , not great ."
i got a peanut butter and banana with boba .
overpriced and mediocre quality sushi .
i ' d say this place is pretty underwhelming .
the organization of the place is odd .
is it a big deal ?
this place gets an f fun times !
if your patient you ' ll eventually find it .
the dude working was nice too .
take that for what it ' s worth .
- some <UNK> of da <UNK> <UNK> .
they are n't made very well though .
explanations on <UNK> are n't too thorough .
0.0 stars rounded down .
not worth an outrageous $ 0.00 .
"i mean come on , how much is rice ?"
<UNK> chicken was also worthy of getting .
a nice tasting curry with various spices <UNK> .
check groupon or yelp for deals here .
the chicken was very overcooked and chewy .
i ' d recommend this curry though .
the food is good and ingredients are fresh .
the alla nora is over-rated .
almost a 0 - star place .
it ' s worth checking out .
the bread was good so ca n't complain there .
overheard 0 other customers ask for the lunch special .
it didnt seem to matter to him .
i guess <UNK> stick with amazon & ebay .
im sure lunch wouldve been better .
"good food like always , but horrible cashier ."
i ' m a big fan of ribs .
no special modifications required .
"great food , good prices !"
i ' ll be back .

this is not a fancy schmancy steak joint .
server was attractive but uneducated about gluten-free .

the dosa is amazing .
it ' s good for conversation .
better than most sushi places about accommodating gluten-free diners .
my water heater leaked and made a big mess .
the water had gotten three rooms ' walls wet .
usually get great service and today was no exception .
there is also sliced leaks and celery .
pretty healthy and tastes awesome .
got to find out how they make it .
things went south from there .
saturday lunch here at scottsdale quarter was very busy .
good but not earth shattering .
excellent by the way .
thought i was in the wrong place .
the wife was starving anyway .
they had grilled pork and shrimp .
"decent amount of meat , tripe , etc . ."
my meal was large also .
the fish sauce is a bit tame .
tried this place for lunch .
for the price it ' s a good value .
the eel avocado roll is good also .
overall good value and i should be back .
also ordered a side of onion rings .
overall good but not outstanding .
the fish burger was much better .
coleslaw again with tomato and sauce .
nice piece of fish .
i had the ono and i would recommend it .
"also had the asian zing sauce , again recommended ."
"good place , very busy ."
no hard chewy calamari here .

my daughter had the clams and pasta dish .
that dish was rather plain .
the wife had lobster ravioli .

f * * * you casa ! !
i was driving around and found this place .
the wynn buffet represents what vegas is today .

the actual buffet looks very nice .
the selection is ridiculous .
typical buffet <UNK> <UNK> with some unique choices .
all you can eat seafood .
"with moderate expectations , we were severely disappointed ."
this has been a great addition to the neighborhood .

cool kat that makes you feel welcome .
thanks for an awesome experience .
the rooms and amenities here a very nice .
drive through high-quality local espresso !

very solid vietnamese food at scottsdale prices .
service and ambiance are usually great .
but also delightful sashimi apps on occasion .
"comfortable , homey fine dining ."
but in a good way .
on the road and need a mac fix ?
we stopped here after some business in mesa .
i eyed the buffet and other offerings .
it all looked and smelled great .
awesome specialty grocery items .
and it is a great deli .
and the lamb app is fun .
this is an intervention .
four stars with almost a hundred reviews ?
just oil and chicken fat .
where is uncle sal ?
old lettuce with large chunks of grated cheese .
lots of running around but nothing accomplished .
was it a racial issue ?
unless the intervention works .
even in scottsdale that ' s just not right .
walgreens and fry ' s nearby .
"never greasy , never stale , always on ."
it ' s not starbucks .
strong mirage wi-fi signal .
"like everything in vegas , a bit overpriced ."
friends said martini was excellent .
bottle beer selection limited .
the awesome protein burger w / pesto .
great outdoor space as well .
it wo n't bring world peace .
and a good juke box and pool table .
"ok , need a bar in the hotel ?"
want something good to eat ?

the restaurant was filled to capacity when we arrived .
i could not believe what i was eating .
not a bad set up at all .
the car was clean and ran great .
i ' d use fox again without a doubt .
every time i go there they mess something up .
most importantly ... the food .
the wings are quite good .
fairly decent upscale southwestern spot .
great margaritas and nice outdoor dinning area .
i would recommend perk to anybody .
excellent service in a very good location .
animal style burger and fries .
it was more than enough to fill us up .

"awesome , amazing , 0 star salsa ."
just go somewhere else .
they ' ll be around next time .
give it a try .
best gourmet pizza in phoenix .

this place needs a better rating .
the best item i had was the <UNK> pizza .

many legit dentists in this area .
not a one time experience .
i will not be back again .

"quick , affordable and professional service ."
very casual place but great food .
- talking about the steakhouse .
they go above and beyond your expectations .
"thanks guys , keep up the great work !"
one of the biggest casino floors on the strip .

i hope you ' re not going anywhere .
the service here was atrocious .
finally the other food came out .
several people ordered steaks .
"she was brought two , for some reason ."
breadcrumbs were never swept away .
speaking of the bill .
but now it ' s too late .
i said my bill is on the table .
never thought to look there ?
was really unimpressed by the food here .
the sausage had this weird sour taste to it .
0th - deep fried figs wrapped in ham .
this place is a riot .
nice old school vibe in this place .
this place could definitely become a regular stop .
had my car repaired .
the staff are extremely friendly and truly love animals .
my puppy is a boxer lab mix .
this is where the <UNK> elite roam .
just came back from el patio .
our first visit based on yelp comments .

"the wait people were excellent , attentive and fast ."
the food was totally awesome .
highly recommend the place .
the food is good but the service sucks .
my wife loves the dishes there .
and served with a big plastic bowl of curry .
the waitress asked if we wanted bread .
the place was remodeled and is not much cleaner .
they rate chinese restaurants based on their peking duck .
our wives complained about the food all night long .
would i go back to the place ?
would i recommend yama sushi ?
this place was amazing .
update : november 0000 .
still one of the best places for sushi .
their appetizer noodle soup is great .
the <UNK> are also great .
so is the chicken burrito .
it is like the typical mexican restaurant .
food is a little better than most .
i was thinking more about work .
the soup on the <UNK> was fantastic in flavor .
same way the beds were left .
the sushi ai n't half bad either .

parking is free if you park yourself .
this particular review is for the 0 bedroom suite .
excellent job and excellent service at a great price .
that included pipe work and all .
"all in all , a great place ."
this is my absolute favorite brunch place in madison .
you wo n't regret doing business here .
defiantly worth a try if you have n't been .
"bianco , cibo - rrb - ."
should deserve six stars .
this is how carne asada tacos should be made .
do n't let the exterior deter you .
keep up the great work .
very friendly staff to top it off .
the baked goods especially stood out in my mind .
delicious ... keep up the good work !
we walked in and the place was nearly empty .
"tell you what , this place is amazing ."
food was not good at all .
got a bowl to-go and it was great .
bill was only $ 000.00 before $ 00 off .
the seasoning of the food here is terrible .
"not cheap , but wow ."
"otherwise , stay at aria or cosmo ."
you do n't go for the food .
and because you can be loud and obnoxious .
but drinkable wine with presumably some alcohol in it .
the food was not bad .
maybe go when you need to absorb fifteen martinis ?
go with <UNK> ' s or another <UNK> beer .
like over a foot long .
and probably three inches thick .
and fat fries <UNK> .
they came with great cole slaw .
beer - - a freaking fantastic beer selection .
ask for a recommendation from the bartenders .
they know their trade maybe try a cask ale .
bartenders - - they are great here .
did i mention seven second beers ?
great service good sushi .
"more tables , other then that good place ."
"excellent food , what else can i say ."
my sazerac was also excellent .
very nice and good .
business center 000 ; awesome .
all the standards were met and with a smile .
good job hampton inn .
this place is awesome .
hofbrauhaus is a must visit .
"after a few minutes , score bar seats ."
lots of flavor with a little spice kick .
lighter than most dark beers .
alcohol at 0.0 % the beers were all good .
"at $ 0.00 a half liter , great price ."
"additionally , the bathroom had no hand soap ."
extremely pleasant and helpful wait staff .
"good place , but this bothers me greatly ."
quality and service was superb .
theres more flavor with a microwave pizza .
what kind of bullshit is that
hotel is super old and just plain cheap .
"diet coke , lemonade and one beer ."
asked if they could do it .
"finally , real food close to asu ."
the gym is pretty basic .
makes working out more enjoyable .
amazing pulled pork sliders & chili .
much needed casual place in dc ranch .
service is great with energetic servers .
"go there , go there now ."
surprisingly good chinese food in the middle of champaign .
coffee and more for most people here .
ribeye for two ... .
the au jus was the best .
campus is very spread out .
some days the satellite room is open .
"$ 0 for breakfast , $ 00 for lunch ."
did n't do the dinner .
krispy kreme doughnuts are very good and fresh .
this is the best fast food fish establishment ever .
"incredible food , service and ambiance ."
traditional french food done perfectly .
"food was really bland , tasted reheated ."
my girlfriend and i love the duck .
the food here is amazing .
"friendly service , fresh , high quality food ."

the skillets are good too !
you wo n't be disappointed .
"food was ok , server was average ."
most items $ 00 + .
ate here while staying at the boulders .
everything we ate was amazing .
i recommend the jalapeã ± o smokehouse burger !
always good and only 0 bucks .
went on a sun morning .
short wait before being seated .
expected more bacon or pork themed items .
ordered chicken fried steak based on another review here .
usually run from the trail head to taliesin overlook .
0.0 miles round trip .
great paved parking lot easy to get to .
"typical , consistent service ."
they hold my money so that ' s good .
everything tasted very fresh and authentic .
all-in-all a nice hotel bar .
every curry i had was runny and fairly bland .
thy stop serving breakfast at 00:00 am on sunday .
it the real deal bbq .
one of the strangest .
"but good , solid american fun ."
breakfast menu on part with any fast food joint .
fried chicken was cooked to perfection .
great season on those collards as well .
my wife really enjoyed her spinach salad also .
so that part was all good .
the bad part was bad .
the food saved this from being a total disaster .
"wow , what a bummer ."
this is the real deal .
really good drink selection and food choices .
the service was very good .
first class all the way .
the appetizer list is perfect for just an occasion .
it was a perfect start to the evening .
"nothing comes cheep , so be prepared to spend ."
because the people that arent vip are all dudes .
very impressed with the staff and the hotel .
just had a great breakfast with my family .
the food was outstanding but the service was exceptional .
dude you sell car <UNK> for a living .
the one dish we both share was the pozole .
if anyone else experienced this please post .
need gps to find .
i ordered some stuff to go .
i have had this place before in orlando .
had the corn chowder and the steak sandwich .
luckily i was able to get through without waiting .
great show in a cool theater .
maybe tuscan style fried chicken means dry and unseasoned ?
quite possibly the best show in vegas .
major thumbs down on that .
i would actually give it 0 stars if possible .
the service was excellent and courteous .
the food was another story .
the wine list was nice but overpriced .
this is one of those older hampton inns .
brother - angus burger .
xs is excess in the worst way .
overpriced and full of itself .
i wo n't be coming back here .
$ 00 including tip .
"also , the main floor is friggin smokey !"
could n't wait to check this place out .
the good : 0 .
the place is n't inviting from the outside .
too many dudes working here !
maybe it ' s better later at night ?
. with all those tv ' s .
this place has a ton of potential .
these extra charges never should have been billed .
i ' ll come back here .
the main problem with the casino is <UNK> .
so they would n't let me bet .
what a terrible business decision .
i guess i ' m missing something ?
tried to call the number and it never worked .
i looked at approximately 0 units .
i found them to be really uninspiring .
keep up the good work m resort and staff .
was a fun way to kill a few hrs .
the $ 0.00 even has a progressive jackpot .
"i guess that still counts , 0 years later ?"
plain jane - nothing special but solid little burger .
the crispy onions were good and a nice touch .
0/0 overall comments 0 .
maybe they could reduce the size of the buns ?
everyone ... a + .
$ 0 for a combo meal with double burger .
this is a special place to me in vegas .
overall pretty disappointing place .
food runners would mutter as they delivered the dishes .
flavors were all quite good .
even if it is for a month .
clearly this is fraud or just plain incompetence .
love the setup and that tvs are everywhere .
everything was great otherwise and will return .
awesome food and place .
the crowd was young hip and friendly btw .
awesome $ 0.00 buffet for lunch .
they also have beer to go .
pretty tasty gyro and seasoned fries .
nothing stood out though .
the venue is fantastic .
we had a great meal .
our server <UNK> was fantastic .
no surrender on a shoe game ?
"again , what is this place trying to be ?"
are they claiming they ' re an upscale hotel ?
the 0nd floor - left <UNK> .
what exactly is this place trying to be ?
who is the target market ?
everything the other good review say is spot on .
sign says western union .
the sandwiches <UNK> in their case looked inedible .
awesome reuben and great service .
it ' s certainly less crowded as well .
the creme de brulee dessert was very good .
crazy otto ' s is a family tradition .
ok food for a chain restaurant .
unique menu with several vegetarian options including taco salads .
service was good and very friendly .
service was n't very good .
good recommendations and good food .
prices are very reasonable and the owners were nice .
there rice and beans are good .
0 chicken 0 beef 0 carnitas .
. very good just got my pizza delivered .
took more than a hour witch is disappointing .
just to start off got wings spicy and teriyaki .
spicy was salty and teriyaki burnt with no flavor .
pizza was even worse .
not really any meat .
do your self a favor dont waste your money .
i just cant believe this restaurant horrible .
food was done on time .
rice beans are good .
the food is n't very good either .
. i read a couple of yelp reviews .
. kind of the same experiences .
highest of high fives .
delivery took quite some time .
always check furniture when it arrives .
the restaurants are mostly open during dinner .
umami burger tasted blend .
the seasoned fries were very good .
"it was better than safe , it was excellent ."
the service was excellent .
this is a top notch restaurant !
"the selection however , was fantastic ."
"first off , the prices are pretty high ."
if there is one theme here its smoke .
"finally , my chief complaint was the internet ."
. its per room per device .
"its pricy , but the gelato is very good ."
"so important to life , yet so poorly reviewed ."
one other side note .
but the portion size was nearly mind bending .
the other major potential disadvantage is the wait .
worth a visit if you are in the area .
stopped in for a slice of the cheesecake .
"second , the service is slow ."
a decent sandwich for a decent price .
pick two entrees 0 .
of course we did not decline .
projects an almost unbearable hipster vibe .
they are always busy and filled with expensive toys .
none of my flavors were really all that great .
"if you are hungry to eat now , beware ."
they absolutely <UNK> my expectations .
just keep the slightly higher price in mind .
but we finally settled on the tacos de adobada .
fortunately it is quite a bit better than that .
a great night overall !
the selection is extraordinary .
"wifi was decent , but a big janky ."
then moved on to a irish iceberg .
how is that for not eating a full meal ?
this is where they chose to take us .
it is quite well laid out and clean .
the same best buy rules apply .
unfortunately it was 00 dollars .
fortunately i knew from a previous bad experience .
this place is <UNK> a dive .
an outstanding view overlooking the fremont street experience .
for dessert the <UNK> sandwiches .
"there is some shade , but not much ."
. the ambiance is fantastic .
complete with the old man with an accordion .
"nothing special , but not bad either ."
"well , this is a tough one for me ."
"the bad though , the rest of the place ."
most of the place still says <UNK> .
they need more or quicker staff .
so props to them for that .
an absolutely <UNK> amount of meat .
the food at pt ' s was very good .
the waitress was also very good .
let me try to explain .
but it can be very long at prime times .
sometimes the same is true of an omelet station .
large shrimp and cracked crab legs are plentiful .
perhaps this is why the foods are n't hot ?
best gun range i have ever been too .
made the environment fun and very safe .
service was very good !
they are meal all to themselves .
the mushrooms were above average .
a lot of healthy choices .
it is a very casual atmosphere .
service was good and quick .
do n't believe the hype .
you order off an ipad .
very cool presentation served in a smoke infused bowl .
so here where we start going down hill .
ordered the royal bone chop .
the steak is $ 000 by itself .
it should be perfect .
my wife ' s was perfect .
they literally poor the sauce over the potato .
corn was mushy as it was over cooked .
but he has seen my total rewards card twice .
i will let you make the decision .
tortilla soup was great .
it is maybe average panera quality now there .
the waiter was pretty good .
it is a very small restaurant .
strongly suggest you give this place a try !
visited on a monday night during monday night football .
the special at that time is half off appetizers .
food tastes better when you earn it .
give this place a shot !
i have always had good luck with these guys .
pizza is always great .
"great sandwiches too , i love their philly steak ."
my new favorite thai joint in vegas .
sauce was perfect consistency and well spiced .
"all in all , a pretty bad experience here ."
this place knocks it out of the park .
turn it up a notch with green chili .
one of the best happy hours in las vegas .
this is my go to place .
gigantic biscuits are the standard here .
oh just read another review with same issue .
me thinks there may be a theme .
run to ups or at least another fedex store .
went early about 0pm .
"clean and neat place , nice deco ."
"service was great , server quick and friendly ."
food though was very average .
good but nothing special .
did enjoy the half priced meal items .
think i will come here only for that reason .
"server was nice , good prompt service ."
an iced tea $ 0 .
"spacious , clean place ."
"great texture , fresh ingredients ."
great crew at <UNK> .
coffee was of starbucks quality but a few cents cheaper
you can modify the service as you deem fit .
enrique <UNK> & pitbull .
"best concert , best singers combination ."
good selection of beer and great service .
this restaurant is off our list .
"marcus came , saw , and conquered !"
this place was recommended by the o'sheas bartender .
$ 000 for 0 burgers and an appetizer .
great food and plenty of it .
fried chicken and waffles was great .
not oregano ' s fault .
anyway on to the food .
oregano ' s i will see you soon .
i dig this place .
all in all a great spot .
yeah i am a globe <UNK> .
that being said i really dig this place .
the service is usually friendly and passable .
thank you to over powered <UNK> security bs .
wo n't fly with them ever again .
chicken croquetas in a tennis shoe .
this was the 0nd bad incident at this store .
good service and clean .
i like this place .
you can substitute a greek salad for fries .
this place is always busy .
our favorite mexican burrito joint .
. really really rough .
onion rings : looked like a brain .
we sat outside and service was good .
. be careful here when shipping stuff .
guy must have thought i was clueless .
terrible ! ! ! lost my wifes shirt .
the burgers were amazing .
slight step up from denny ' s .
just do n't come with high expectations .
best place in arizona !
"good food , decent beer , terrible bar service ."
girl with short blond hair behind bar was awful .
just stupid business practices .
"all in all , i ' d pass ."
be aware of these people out there .
had a great time with a bachelor party .
definitely a good activity off the strip .
took my kids and i was greatly impressed .
"the staff was great , plenty of security ."
the area was well lit .
restaurants are close by and plenty of drinks .
not a bad review .
please remake my meal .
i give it two stars .
yeah not going to be back .
the staff is friendly the wait time was average .
the place was extremely clean .
nothing bad i can say !
i had the 00 ' ' bobbie .
the staff has a bad day and it shows .
they get everyone in and out with no problems .
they do have specials you have to watch .
they still offer one beer per parent .
the staff was friendly and courtesy .
they take care of their employees .
i ended up getting a fully loaded burrito .
i can not describe the way the burrito tasted .
went to grab an order to go .
had an old time diner feel to it .
you ca n't go wrong here .
always a step ahead .
my wife was very adventurous on this trip .
it was perfectly prepared rare .
say what you want about bobby flay .
what a fantastic place .
great platter to start off a great meal .
"it was like velvet , and perfectly prepared ."
it is what it is .
it ' s a bar that serves bar food .
i had the sausage and cheese plate .
i ' ve had worse though .
i started with the house-made pate .
my wife had the butter lettuce salad .
"the food is ok , the prices are ridiculous ."
my wife ordered the build your own omelette .
the queen clt features a light tempura batter .
"overall , very good ."
my wife ordered the smoked salmon scramble .
"i had the pork benny , also delicious ."
here ' s my issue .
there are other places that we need to try .
"my wife had flight 0 , grassy fields ."
the girl sliding down the volcano is unnecessary .
the fish sandwich is good .
"in summary , food good atmosphere bad ."
"bad , bad , fucking bad orange chicken ."
<UNK> ' s gyro was excellent .
great lunch under $ 00 plus tip .
dinner # 0 was lemon grass soup with chicken .
"overall , a good value and very good food ."
there are better and cheap steaks available around strip .
which still took a long time .
first time there after finding them with yelp .
the food was quite good especially the pork sandwich .
prices were good but the food was outstanding .
been here a number of times .
this place is quickly becoming a favorite .
both breakfast and lunch were outstanding .
been here three times now never a disappointment .
for a chain style sub place its quite good .
atmosphere would be lacking service is so so .
you get tired of the typical fast food burgers .
food is great people are nice .
as gordon ramsey would say ... .
people can tell the difference .
big portions and great food .
and definitely overpriced for what you get .
this was one of them .
the ribs were the worst i have ever had !
the only thing my wife liked was the chicken .
that is what makes these places unique .
try again on your recipe for the sauce .
"sorry guys , but very disappointed ."
i would go into further detail but enough said .
excellent food ; fantastic decor .
update as of 0-0- 00 .
looks like they do n't care .
completely disgusted by this .
the food was very good and flavorful .
the hostess needs to be better trained .
portion size is large and the food tastes fresh .
the tortillas were fantastic .
only bit of confusion is with the menu .
did n't see this indicated on the menu anywhere .
this was my first trip since the ownership changed .
this review is based upon a lunchtime visit .
the food is good and is a good value .
both times have been very good .
i will definitely keep on returning to this establishment .
now for the positives .
i gave this establishment another shot this evening .
the food has always been excellent quality .
i made a 0p m reservation for five .
what a waste of time .
all the hot buffet items were cold .
must try if you have not been already .
that was 0:00 pm .
what is wrong with aria customer service ?
this place is first class in every way .
lobster bisque is second to none .
the laser and light show is second to none .
definitely a highlight of my trip .
i paid 000 form thurs - mon . .
' ' the lounge is kinda <UNK> and dark .
if it aint broke dont fix it .
now dont get me wrong .
you wont be sorry if you stop by .
this place is incredible .
the food was unbelievable .
it is a good value for what you get .
the service was excellent .
too many beautiful resorts in this town .
make sure to bring your players card .
looking forward to going back in dec . .
the m resort is new and beautiful .
the casino is open and not smokey .
the rooms are nice and public areas are clean .
the funniest and up close show in vegas .
it is the best in vegas .
drink two of these and you are good .
food is also good but a bit overpriced .
a sure sign of short cut smoking procedures .
more of a roast cut .
throw it on a plate and roll it out .
want a real treat ?
order the soft shell crab with sweet chili .
"cheap , spicy and byob ."
what else do you need ?
not a fan of a clubby hookah lounge .
this place is awesome !
it may be the best place for coffee downtown .
asked for chili paste which never came .
where ' s the shot ?
worth the drive ... thanks again guys !
forget about cocktail service at the machines .
indians want $ $ $ $ only .
both sandwiches were served just as ordered .
the other good thing is the price .
$ 0 + per sandwich with sides .
what more could you ask for .
simple menu but good food made fresh .
hand made hamburger and patty melt were our treats .
our waitress was outstanding .
ordered mushrooms for appetizer and had brisket for dinner .
my move was not your usual move .
0rd and 0th stops unloading same .
the best part is there is no guessing .
went there for the fish taco ' s .
had to remember this is a sports bar .
ok if this is what you want .
"ordered cheeseburger with garlic fries , medium ."
soup steak and onion .
. meal was on table in about 00 mins .
now the bad news .
"soup was ok , nothing special ."
total bill $ 00.00 without tip .
0 in the last several years .
"<UNK> cow , <UNK> and now this ."
the overall opinion was just ok .
meat quality and tenderness was poor .
had better at the same price .
poor teenage waitress was worked .
oh well you go you might enjoy it .
will every meal get a 00 for presentation ?
the wings are awesome .
food was very good as well as service .
you pay $ 00 to eat some food .
time to retire for sure .
the food is very very good .
why had i not done this before ?
it was the chili .
made all the difference .
now for some <UNK> .
the collard greens were excellent !
the potato salad was a bust .
finally - the staff is top notch .
sunset here makes everything all right in the world .
like : holiday inn ordinary .
it ' s vegas : take a gamble .
"bit overpriced , but <UNK> good fish and eel ."
you need to know your stock 0 .
as a teenager i grew up in atlanta .
overall the pork was very good moist and flavorful .
overall i would say successful .
ordered the carne asada burrito online as takeout .
probably a great place for adults during nice days .
there are several nice charcoal grills to be used .
pretty good nothing to write home about .
hot and served with ripe fresh fruit and salad .
came in at 00 noon .
ordered the albacore tuna melt .
this frequently requires a fair wait .
the best food in charlotte .
what else do i have to say ?
i have been eating there for 00 years .
the service and wine were very good .
this place does not deliver the goods .
good not mind blowing .
this place is hit or miss .
the food however falls a little short .
so why this place ... ?
as we all know time is money .
tip : make reservations .
the list goes on .
the falafel pita was damn good !
the hummus on top completed it .
"honest , quick service , and a great value ."
"service was good , very friendly ."
luxury all the way .
beautiful <UNK> low price great for kids and family .
i really had a great experience talking to lance .
they offer a breakfast buffet in the morning .
nice little touch there .
the restaurant is clean and neatly appointed .
"but please , you must try it for yourself ."
a must visit during every vegas trip .
' ' ended up working out anyways .
dude must be all talk about his food .
should have went to buffet a caesars .
this is a pretty good indian restaurant .
i found this on yelp .
the bbq is pretty darn good .
the sandwiches i took home were all very good .
"second , they short me an order of fries ."
"food good , service , not so much ."
these guys did a great job .
i had aaron come out with another cleaner .
"they were quick , personable , and very <UNK> ."
the price was competitive and the carpet looks fantastic .
no one else feels as genuine .
amazing burger and an awesome shake .
could n't ask for anything else .
how high class is it supposed to be ?
just how much better of a deal ?
"also , the sound acoustics are understandably quite poor ."
"well , let me tell you a little story ."
' ' uhh ... what ?
and it took two weeks to figure this out ?
i even located internet forum threads <UNK> similar cases .
microwaved pizza just is n't good .
especially when 0 pizza is $ 00 .
the eggs were like little yellow bricks .
they got a repair shop too .
<UNK> selection is awesome .
maybe impressive is a better description .
here is another reason to stay away .
let me say i screwed up 0 times .
deal or no deal ?
just say ` ` no deal ' ' .
"in a word , ` ` meh ."
"sure enough , it was called the chicago ."
"the bread was excellent , flavorful and fresh ."
started out pretty good and <UNK> out .
every flavor is well made .
very good made well .
they also do half rolls which i prefer .
very garlicky and intensely flavored .
"always consistent and reliable for decent , crispy wings ."
<UNK> - roast chicken was too dry .
the pizza and garlic knots tasted like cardboard .
"yes , that ' s an insult ."
"yes , these are as good as it gets ."
you ca n't sell people a product like that .
his support staff is awesome as well .
the service was very friendly .
excellent 0 star jewelers !
"well done , bachi !"
"literally , fall off the bone tender ."
they are better than echo and rig though .
this is one of those places .
these are not your typical dunk into coffee donuts .
service is friendly and relatively fast .
these fries are easily 0 stars .
service is somewhere just below friendly .
i suspect they have each portion already cooked separately .
very tasty with the little white buns .
the <UNK> here are really unacceptable .
"but , let ' s start with the positive ."
these are the exception .
this is the place for brunch in montreal .
yes it is not cheap .
wow this is simply a wow place .
also the beer is good but a little overpriced .
it a nice place but not amazing .
they also have a nice cheese filed version .
i tried different types still horrible .
i have a new favorite thai restaurant in pittsburgh .
the tofu paradise is aptly named .
they ' re really effing good fries .
this may be the best food in pittsburgh .
"sorry , quiet storm ."
lunch is always a pleasure .
"keep it up , <UNK> !"
"best ethiopian in pittsburgh , hands down ."
great value for the money .
i have not been satisfied with completed repairs twice .
wife and i went for lunch .
"food was good , price was moderate ."
first time calling this company for garage door repair .
took the time to do the job right .
our burger and fries were very good .
our second visit to this fine establishment .
beginning fourth week in this fine hotel .
all food excellent quality !
arrived around 0 pm and seated right away .
the food was very good and reasonably priced .
same name just a little lower quality on things .
great location by capital building .
anything else also it took a while to get .
"as i write this , i can hardly move ."
you ' ll probably need it .
it was like i was making a new friend .
they look five shades <UNK> .
"service was good , not great ."
about what you would expect for what you get .

this place is so phony and fake .

it is unreal japanese food .
yet nothing happens to them .
very unprofessional behavior from all of the night staff .
"well , where to start ?"
do i start at the incompetent employees ?
perhaps the filthy rooms ?
i showed up sunday night .
stay the hell away from this mess .
i typically go for the grand suite or higher .
the architecture is absolutely insane .
those guys did absolutely nothing in their respective sport .
this was my fifth time here .

the lockers are free .
massages are quite expensive .
<UNK> ' s is fantastic .
salmon and tuna were standouts .

the food however was just fair .
the soup looked good but was hard to eat .
the broth was thin .
that ' s it for the good parts .

really good chicago style hotdogs / chili dogs .
in progress of getting liquor license .
hungry for quality at an exceptional price .
the ambience was not at all what we expected .
what an unforgettable time visiting the excalibur .

there was actually a wait list .
average out to 0 stars .
areas to build with blocks and learn about architecture .
a science theatre area where <UNK> are performed .
"` ` here you are , four <UNK> !"
"only 0 on tap , boo hoo !"
but around 000 in bottles .
the wait staff was great .
"huge deli , meat and seafood counters ."
what ' s a parent to do ?
buy everyone season passes except yourself .
the negatives and positives kinda balance each other out .
the best part for me was at harmony hall .
and raspberry coke is pretty awesome .
went really well with a nowhere porter .
they thought this was the coolest thing ever .
the only really negative thing was the crowd .
otherwise this is your average old navy .
"hey , what did you expect ?"
the acoustics are pretty darn good .
good lighting and great music .
great addition to noda .
a stones throw from amelie ' s .
the oyster stout was spot on - another hit .
frugal <UNK> ' s has quite the positive reputation .
there are bottle shops in noda with similar prices .
what i do want to talk about is nikki .
really like this place .
"very clean , neat and well maintained ."
what else can i say ?
great beer selection at fair prices .
large screen tv with sports .
this sandwich was awesomeness to the tenth power .
neat little coffee shop in downtown belmont .
this place has it all .
"the decor is unique , modern , crazy awesome ."
torn over the review on this one .
"great flow , great feng shui ."
solid place to get a cheap meal .
the famed parmesan fries were indeed killer .
the products here are excellent though .
do n't throw rotten vegetables at me please .
did not care for their ipa .
just what is he thinking ?
' ' he is a mysterious beast .
0.0 stars rounded up to five .
<UNK> <UNK> saison and <UNK> flora brass monkey ?
who picks this stuff ?
because you are ` ` the man ' ' .
did you sell your first born ?
<UNK> with the devil ?
you ' re just a beer genius .
great 0 star dish !
drench some arepas in this sauce = so good !
let ' s check this place out .
plus tons of kitchen gadgets .
lawn and garden too ? ? paint department .
that does n't happen at home depot .
food was good but service was very bad .
may try it again someday .
"first nyc , now vegas ."
"red meat , got to bachi ."
"and finally , a <UNK> : <UNK> sho une ."
. but with good food .
"red meat , got to bachi ."
it ' s such oral satisfaction .
"next stop , total world <UNK> !"
and this is n't really chinese is it ?
jets and shark <UNK> ?
an alter ... to what ?
"but with fukuburger , you ca n't go wrong ."
"protein component , check !"
"fried component , check !"
"the service , food and atmosphere are phenomenal ."
it actually turned out great .
good was top notch .
even all the appetizers were great .
the best sushi buffet i have ever been to .
great place at the stratosphere .
they play 00/00 s music and take requests .
they were all very good .
i had the classic club sandwich .
"i left full , so i ' m happy ."
it was better than i expected .
they have a stock market drink menu .
i had the <UNK> <UNK> and james <UNK> .
for appetizer we had the nightmare nachos .
they are nachos with nightmare chili on them .
she is a tough mac and cheese critic .
they are closed most sundays .
unless there is a major event downtown .
the sushi was great .
the flying kamikaze was my favorite .
i am a fan of this place .
the best mexican food i ' ve ever eaten .
it is about the size of a medium pizza .
the burgers are amazing .
the beer was ice cold .
the food was amazing .
and the largely local clientele bore this out .
his effort was astonishing .
and a memory to renew when visiting charlotte again .
their vegan dishes are enjoyable even for the <UNK> .
this place does the job for a good price .
its like having <UNK> of flavor in your mouth .
fancy cheese without the price tag commitment ?
their free breakfast is pretty <UNK> case closed .
rare in az nice job anthem barro ' s !
firefly in las vegas is a nice place .
firefly was a good choice .
"good hotel , good price ."
the beef was salty .
"overall , the burger was pretty big and tasty ."
mi casa grill cantina was the place to be .
they have the normal dim sum fare .
i cant show up empty handed .
nope ... just cant !
what would impress a group of chicks ?
might as well i figured .
the nice lady on the phone was super helpful .
me : uhh ... .
no problem she replied .
would i get these again ?
i better stop while i ' m ahead .
tons and tons of other asian families eating here .
its weird to explain but its good .
the dish here actually has large chunks of meat .
the oyster clay pot was surprisingly filled with ... .
this place is great .
i highly recommended it .
i think the place seats about 000 easily .
the food was awesome .
i guess thats better than nothing .
the place on a friday night was pretty busy .
overall the food was pretty good .
what did scare me was the place was empty .
"when they say steak , they mean it !"
its like regular beef teri on steroids !
the roast port was tender and soft .
large portions as well .
this dish was awesome as well .
i licked my fork and damn ... .
i had to dig in .
the food is awesome .
you will not be disappointed .
otherwise its about $ 0 an hour or something .
on the ceiling plays a light show every hour .
he looks like a nice guy .
an in-n-out only 0 miles from my place .
"well , in a good way i mean ."
i drive by and the dining room seems empty .
this place has some awesome food .
dishes were about $ 00 a pop .
what do they serve ?
good cheap mexican food .
check out the picture i posted .
' ' how can one go wrong with that ?
it was damn good .
but damn it was good .
great minds and hungry stomachs think alike .
so the obvious question always pops up .
a few dollars means nothing .
lets get to the real review ... the food .
all i can say was wow .
he lays down two menus and our adventure begins .
"remember , we ' re looking for key words ."
he recommends the <UNK> <UNK> and the linguini calamari .
the kitchen happily obliged .
both dishes were pretty good .
we both got along pretty well .
would i eat at this place again ?
clearly a win win situation .
so what do i see ?
a brand new subway joint on my way home !
the inside looks like every other chipotle .
the food is pretty consistent to every other chipotle .
its a chain restaurant !
i figure it was close to about $ 00 .
"' ' ` ` sure , this way please ."
i guess thats what i get for assuming .
everything just seemed normal .
so far i enjoyed 0 out of 00 dishes .
that was very tasty .
that ' s a good sign .
boy was i wrong again .
i ' m not doing well on assumptions tonight .
what else could go wrong ?
wynn or bellagio buffet ?
the food just tastes better there .
the food was amazingly good .
now back to the steak house .
whats wrong with the location ?
the meat was tender and robust with flavor .
the lobster sauce was a hit as well .
what is it you ask ?
oh yeah ... this is my favorite part .
some of the male wait staff seem lost .
its pretty tasty there .
"' ' ` ` yes , why ?"
is it really that good ?
not to bad i guess .
lets get to the important stuff .
light crispy skin with honey garlic spicy sauce .
definitely more than i expected .
and most importantly ... dont forget to invite me !
i hear the lunch buffet is not very good .
they confirm its the correct place .
it has the typical chinese fare .
it was surprisingly good .
"as always , i posted some pictures ."
i take that as a good sign .
meats meats meats was the name of the game .
"<UNK> , thats alot !"
", and wedge cut fries ."
man was the food tasty .
this was way better than memphis championship bbq .
dmv or keno you ask ?
they give us two menus .
it was good ... not excellent but good nevertheless .
this was another decent dish .
i am always willing to wait for clean dishes !
the menu looked decent for an italian place .
it was simple yet very tasty .
the shrimp scampi looked pretty good .
how can you go wrong with the best seller ?
you read that right .
"to be honest , it was too much ."
overall just an ` ` a-ok ' ' meal .
would i eat here again ?
i ' d give it another shot .
just a filler dish for a cheap price .
"overall , i would give this place a 0.0 ."
what ' s the next best thing ?
the total cost came out to around $ 00 .
would i recommend what i ordered ?
you really cant go wrong here .
bottom line ... did i like the food ?
sure ... it was good but not great .
soft yet with a crisp of crunchiness .
i recommend trying this place .
everything i had lacked flavor and care .
best bbq i ' ve had !
this is a <UNK> decision .
they do excellent work and always run on schedule .
there are far far better places to stay .
the cod was tender while the breading was crispy .
cons : the portions are small .
these things are awesome !
stopped by to give this place a try .
overall a very good meal with excellent service .
the car arrived as described .
the chicken vindaloo is awesome .
"great place , amazing staff and affordable prices ."
standard dishes were on point .
prices are a little steep for mediocre food .
in this case it is justified .
"again , read the first line ."
the food was luke warm and of poor quality .
there was no sauce that had flavor either .
the shrimp was small and rubbery .
i spent 00 dollars for 0 plates of food .
want a gimmick place to eat for 00 bucks ?
steer clear of this one .
this went on for about 00 minutes .
if you are on a tight time limit .
and veal was as tender as a <UNK> .
the quality of the food was not very good .
i reserve vehicle and pre-paid on <UNK> 00 .
. great friendly service .
even 0 star is to much for this location .
wine tasting gives a nice touch .
"good service , excellent prices ."
- everybody must try it .
helped make the evening enjoyable .
great place for crepes .
my daughter arrives and sees the doctor without problems .
here ' s the thing .
magazine was $ 00.00 .
yes sports are on mute .
establish an identity and be true to it .
the outside may not draw you in .
everyone including the people were fun and talkative .
the cold brew was pretty decent though .
the detail and craftsmanship is incredible .
not redeeming enough to land another star though .
"food was bad , ordered couple apps like wings ."
typical old new york cabbie .
i would compare the food to moderate dining .
i give it 0 stars .
went to north scottsdale .
hopefully the managers look at these .
you are smarter then the employee .
i try to avoid walmart at all costs .
just bought a car from them .
"bought a car $ 0,000 below the blue book ."
try the chicken dishes .
"good was great , service great ."
the salmon was excellent a must have .
westin is much better service .
<UNK> is even better then this .
not living up to the hype .
but that was about 00 minutes later .
"next time get it right , this is scottsdale !"
kept hitting on my girlfriend in front of me .
bunch of non english speaking jerks on their bluetooth .
take you the long way and have dirty cars .
had usual good <UNK> until today .
college girls with great bodies .
they will scam you .
burgers are overpriced for this style .
i think 0.00 for an average size burger .
fries are extra more than 0 dollars .
but overall a very good place with friendly service .
hosted clients for dinner on wednesday .
i ordered the steak au poivre medium rare .
this might be the best one of them all .
i recommend the <UNK> .
same for going early .
delivery time was off by 00 minutes late .
is n't the tip the delivery charge ?
"price was less than advertised , wifi worked fine ."
breakfast was kind of lame too .
room was not spotless but not bad either .
i give ' em a 0â 0/0 outta 0 .
used to be good .
ancient stained plastic toilet seat .
"wonderful , causal food with excellent <UNK> staff !"
"they produced excellent fresh and delicious food , quickly ."
pretty cool place over looking the strip .
do n't waste your time here .
this location in the airport is trash .
you will not regret it .
ask for joey the bartender he is official !
really cool chipotle style concept but with pizza !
they rolls are pencil dick thin .
if you love sushi stay away from this place .
this theater is a scam .
they are very unhelpful and hide behind their policies .
customer service rating of - 0 stars .
- lrb - i like to play with matches .
it ' s under $ 00 with coupon .
the hotel seems cool in that it has rides .
dated but still somewhat fun .
literally the best buffet i have ever been to .
shrimp are large and plentiful .
"this is america , man !"
the ambience is lacking .
vegas requires a surprisingly large amount of thinking .
does the club pay for the cab ?
buy her a drink ... or not .
girl : * surprised look * <UNK> : uh .
what do you use ?
<UNK> : ... shampoo .
i ' ve heard nothing but good things .
mgm would n't be mgm without the lions .
prices at both of these places are n't <UNK> .
rainforest cafe is great for kids .
i would gladly stay here again .
that is part of the experience .
la hacienda at the fairmont is far better .
had the sausage parmigiana .
sauce was very bland .
no flavors of any spice .
tasted like straight tomato sauce straight from the can .
had the greek combo plate .
"greek salad , <UNK> , <UNK> , and hummus ."
we only got through 00 % of it .
both were top notch at a great price .
they were better without .
a sign of great things to come .
low ceilings and moldy bathroom .
this is one of the best by far .
used bikes without the head ache .
00 day warranty plus a trade in program .
"great atmosphere , well priced , and good food ."
great flavors and cooked perfect as were the fries .
service was first rate .
yup there is lobster here over flowing the bun .
"awesome place , enough said , go ."
both recommended and excellent .
"desert also looked good , but no room ."
where did they go ?
theater is beautiful and seating looks good from anywhere .
the orchestra sounded superb as well as the singers .
all the good stuff expected from a cirque show .
like before the <UNK> crew was great .
se ya next time .
there goes a star hitting the boulevard .
the place is an absolute shit hole .
these folks are flat out crooks .
and i am a thai food connoisseur .
"great , friendly staff ."
i ordered the arizona burrito with a water .
pittsburgh has very few good thai resturants .
so go in and takeout or sit down .
nothing like it in pittsburgh .
for the price you could do better .
it was my first gyro and i enjoyed it .
it is <UNK> maybe slightly criminal and racist .
feedback on the empanadas was a <UNK> ok .
the bread and oil was pretty good .
she had the fettuccini alfredo which was <UNK> good .
"for now , i ' ll say a 0/0 ."
she said the bolognese was also very good .
what a great guy !
the buffalo sauce that was on there drenched everything .
"after tax , my wrap was over $ 0 ."
one of c-u ' s best kept food secrets .
this also was quite good .
overall a solid take out experience .
"other than that , no complaints on the food ."
these were done right .
did n't get any fries or anything with it .
the mac and cheese bites were also surprisingly good .
the fish taco was surprisingly good .
my burrito bowl was also quite tasty .
this was not your grandmother ' s meatloaf !
my only reservations about siam terrace is the price .
the place is pretty nice on the inside .
"clean , fairly spacious and a cool atmosphere ."
mine was pretty tasty .
my other qualm was the price .
my only qualms is that cracked can get expensive .
the fried rice was pretty bland as well .
"eggrolls not very good , either ."
"well , the rumor was certainly confirmed ."
this other server - lrb - maybe a manager ?
this was surprisingly good .
"either way , they were both decent ."
another great food truck on campus !
a really <UNK> doughnut .
"winner , winner , bbq dinner ! ? yes !"
now come my only 0 complaints .
everything was as excellent as it usually is .
"folks , this was an unreal combination ."
it really seems like they have everything here .
friendly folks at the counter .
stopped in for the $ 0.00 lunch buffet .
"the food , i would say is the same ."
not a big deal at all .
i opted instead for the carne asada <UNK> .
"not this guy , 0/0 ."
"my mixed grill was really awesome , too ."
perhaps they need some more hands in the kitchen ?
i also ordered 0 single gyro .
it seemed like they were a little understaffed .
$ 0.00 for a bottle of miller lite ?
"thanks , red lion !"
nice spot for new york style slices .

the bean and potato burrito is good too .
this is an amazing culinary experience for two reasons .
all foods are well marked for <UNK> .
gf bakery has some great creations .
i was n't blown away .
crust was perfect in taste and texture .
typical looking taqueria / taco stand .
they gave us <UNK> al pastor .
"garlic mashed potatoes were ok , nothing special ."
the waiters were attentive and came by when needed .
krazy fish is a great addition to the neighborhood .
everything is great about this place .
. this place is open late too .
. great pizza great drinks .
service is quick as expected .
sandwich is good but pastrami was chewy .
fries were a little undercooked .
asked for double meat but same amount as friend .
it should be hot .
i ' m a fan .
great concept and super value for north scottsdale .
take a look at the pic i uploaded .
all that food for eight bucks .
they said it was as good as pita jungle .
"biscuits made from scratch , not frozen ."
"a group of friendly , engaging staff ."
the best part of the place is atmosphere .
all the food was tasty .
i ' m not joking .
"in fact , the food looks good ."
and the soda selection is perfect .
and the price is reasonable .
this place is a perfect addition to the neighborhood .
very well seasoned in olive oil and cheese .
the menu is a total winner .
"finally , i must mention the beer selection ."
"instead , my nose was hit with incense burning ."
like a rain dance during a <UNK> .
i thought the meats tasted great .
the little lumpia egg rolls were a true treat .
` ` old school ' ' chinese food here .
"a decent meal , a decent value ."

the tacos had great flavor .
the bill was very low .
"again , the taste was decent ."
really low prices and some nice baked goods .
bar none the best .
"second , the hummus ."
"third , the prices ."
this place is a great bargain .
"sixth , everything else ."
in closing please excuse my spelling .
i ' m a fan .
welcome to town five guys .
"anyway , <UNK> ' s proves my point ."
that was one tasty diet drink .
plus the food is good .
most places make boring egg drop soup .
this is actually special .
lots of hard rock blaring from the speakers .
bring you nose ring and your chop sticks .
the portions are plentiful .
the chow fun noodles should not be missed .
this is my new favorite chinese restaurant .
nice overall pizza and italian fare .
you must think i ' m a real tool .
the food is high quality and comforting .
"come on tony , where ' s the love ."
it garnishes 0 stars for sure .

the meat in that taco was cooked to perfection .
the sakana lunch special is 000 % satisfying .
but the portions are out of sight .
the hot dogs are fantastic .
"the burger was good , but not fantastic ."
i ' m a fan .
it deserves 0 stars .
pastrami on the burger .
i ' m not joking here folks .
pastrami on the burger .
this joint does not get any more humble .
it ' s literally a hole in a wall .

"part restaurant , part sports bar ."
much better than the national chains .
only issue is location .
"great service , great food , great atmosphere ."
best steak i ever had .
table bread was great .
ate there saturday noon and it was very disappointing .
so many better options in madison .
waitstaff was clumsy when putting the food down .
no wonder this place has crap ratings online .
butternut soup is excellent and creamy .
the imax is superb as well .
decent bang for your buck though .
waitress did not understand english .
order the kitchen sink .
was at wells fargo and chase both this morning .
then asked if i wanted a receipt .
better than dennys and quality around <UNK> .
got steak and eggs .
enjoyed the food and service was prompt .
overall good place to come back to for breakfast .
the service was great .
the wings here were fall off the bone amazing .
and my girlfriend got fish and chips .
give this place a try .
great food great atmosphere .
bunch of damn <UNK> .
"walk-in , not to crowded on a tuesday night ."
"ribs , sausage , and pulled pork all hits ."
exceptional food for the low price .
got the big burrito especial .
wow what a great burger .
oh yeah the food .
oh and they have that e n p ranch .
their white pizza is perfect .
always a friendly non pretentious crowd here .
"like they should charge a cover , awesome ."
good food at a decent price .
the food is absolutely terrific .
ask for danny the general manager .
what the hell is this service quality ?
the place is not very appealing from the street .
this place is borderline garbage .
you sure think twice when looking at your bill .
and it went down hill from there .
you can not make up stuff like this .
"first visit , will return ."
the relatively recent menu change is a good example .
they serve great and unique southwestern fare .
great selection on menu .
"great atmosphere , ran into several friends each visit ."
the good : 0 .
they have cold shrimp and crab legs .
the fruit filling is not fresh .
the bad : 0 .
very friendly staff and extremely timely .
they did a fantastic job every time .
one called himself a local <UNK> on wheels .
what else is there .
"freindly , knowledgable staff run the counter ."
go in the basement for even more genres .
support them in that noble cause .
"its still in my wallet , i hope ."
"price : reasonable , not extreme either way ."
nothing i ' ve rented had errors or scratches .
guy inside listening to loud <UNK> music .
the gyro sandwich i previously had sucked .
bread wad hard and stale .
not going to this slice o ' somethin again .
"poor hours , selection and service ."
"service was good , or better ."
"really nice service here , even at 0:00 a ."
new menu : <UNK> food portions .
"- rrb - , also sushi trays & drinks ."
"thats it , <UNK> !"
great food all around .
authentic as can be .
not the best but by far not the worst .
"ok , got it off my chest ."
the rooms are quite nice as well .
had a great dining experience .
the place used to be awesome .
last night we ate there and service was off .
the food was definitely below par .
avoid this dump at all costs .
atmosphere was full of character .
definitely a return visit .
live acoustic music on sundays is an added bonus .
great service all around .
sophie ' s in one word ?
dining is an experience .
"the dining room is inviting , calming , welcoming ."
do you wait for your food ?
the menu is above average and priced well .
by now molly ' s bleeding had basically stopped .
i followed his advise .
place is always clean and nicely <UNK> .
<UNK> on premises but expensive and long turnaround times .
cons : staff pretty much sucks .
they have all the standard flavors and then some .
my personal favorite is the whole wheat mixed .
what a bunch of absolute business idiots !
we ' re seated and ready to order .
the new renovation was a joke .
new floors and annoying disco lights in spin .
"i am here with my dog , molly ."
a little about the practice itself .
the place is every clean .
well appointed but not over the top .
this practice lends itself to that .
the ribs just fall off the bone ... delicious .
lots of stuff in it .
tvs in the dining room .
another factor to consider is communication .
his expectations were right on the money .
a bar with bar food .
the food is just fine for a bar .
food came out promptly .
the place was clean .
as for the age reference of the patrons .
now the place is always empty .
0 or 0 tables occupied .
"great food , great service , and well priced ."
do n't let the outside turn you away .
good people making great food .
definitely give it a try great meal .
nice people great tradition indian cuisine .
yogurtland is a chain self-serve frozen yogurt entity .
prices had the expected resort markup .
one of the classic stadium destinations in college football .
"suffice it to say , the place is huge ."
but lousy service drops this to two stars .
"overall , a basic breakfast at a reasonable price ."
i wonder about restaurants named after cities .
there is room for an upgrade here .
instead i went with a main course .
so i went with the ... bacon cheeseburger .
<UNK> is one of my favorite airports .
' ' or being delayed by freak <UNK> .
the second complaint is security .
do you work for the <UNK> ?
thanks for noticing buddy .
make people walk by the gaming areas .
"nice , respectable breakfast place near encanto park ."
this is actually pretty good thai food .
"good , <UNK> food ."
food is good nothing to get exited .
but its their business .
food ok nothing to write home about it .
wing are better at buffalo wings .
sorry owners but you messed up this time .
but yelp wins again .
good portion with perfectly prepared rice .
will return to go for the basil duck .
"quaint , quiet , tasteful ."
installation was excellent and professional .
they are the quality from start to finish .
i would recommend this to anyone .
give them a shot .
especially if you get to hear the birthday song .
. probably a good place to bring kids .
such an amazing boba shop .
"five stars , <UNK> ."
but this place is a disaster .
i guess third strike and they ' re out .
"service is great here , very friendly ."
"service is great here , very friendly ."
the miso soup was amazing .
0 bucks for one burger ?
that does n't even include fries .
"compared to <UNK> , this place has better food ."
there was no sauce at all .
and their beef tongue was really exquisite .
good food and great company .
looking for dinner while on a business trip .
plenty of beers to chose from .
stayed at the hotel next to this place .
"had really good food and great , personable staff ."
i recommend the cajun penne dish .
"also , 0 pool tables ."
cooked exactly as i requested .
my server was only worth 0 stars also .
at least act like you want your job
"hell , even the red rock buffet is better ."
over half of the buffet was dedicated to breakfast .
chinese food was garbage .
this place is cramped and the food is unimpressive .
i almost <UNK> with joy .
decent buffet outside of the las vegas strip .
the food here is not that great .
she was very professional with a great personality .
"my personal favorites are hurricane , and <UNK> ."
visiting vegas and getting a hurricane fat tuesday ?
. and the flavor is spot on .
"that ' s right , 0 star ."
this place is a joke .
i ' m going back to <UNK> .
they talk big but ca n't back it up .
they wo n't be in business long .
i would score 0 stars if it was available .
end result is everything is ok .
"wow , never again ."
they make a decent pie .
interesting combinations instead of the usual fare .
props to the musicians and the <UNK> .
the clown acts were also predictable and slow .
then it all went downhill from there .
i must say that our service was very good .
this is a drink spot .
in-store orders are quick and painless .
"tonight i salute you , mr . jimmy john ."
this is n't macayos .
great experience every time .
the mesa and south phoenix restaurants never disappoint .
this is n't macayos .
the employees are extremely friendly .
great experience every time .
at $ 00.00 for a footlong was a joke !
i do have 0 tiny complaint .
nice flat screen tv in lobby .
"i emailed the location may 00 , 0000 ."
fantastic experience for lunch here today .
their sandwiches and flatbreads were amazing .
"awesome food , awesome prices , and great service ."
very trustworthy and very good at what they do .
"service was great , the fish was fresh ."
all in all a very enjoyable experience .
carnitas were on point .
it literally took 00 minutes in line .
i was amazed by the quality of the chicken .
the great amount of care they take is consistent .
i end up in henderson from time to time .
the jambalaya is off the hook .
the etouffee ' is rockin ' .
i think the chef ' s name is kevin .
same guy as 0 years ago .
at least now you know .
"i get the <UNK> burrito , which is huge ."
jumped out of dead stop traffic on a whim .
great deal / good ambiance / friendly knowledge staff .
the biscuits were light and flakey .
"cool guy , very laid back ."
i am very happy with the work .
great old <UNK> place .
do n't pass it up .
this place is off the hook .
do n't miss this gem of a joint .
nothing great about the food .
the chicken chow mein however was pretty damn good .
the food is good but not great .
it ' s a laid back bar .
"oh yeah , the burger ."
if you are thinking of coming here .
you guys are a joke .
shame on me for not listening .
food was below average .
i ' d say the food is good .
i ' ll probably be back .
this review is long over due .
great service and great food .
house fried rice is awesome .
how did this pizza pass quality check ?
this place is perfect for the <UNK> .
super nice rooms and well decorated <UNK> .
the buffet is complete and the staff is courteous .
banana cream pie was awesome .
very basic grub served by tough looking staff .
skip it unless you are desperate .
"great outdoor patio , bartender super friendly ."
chicken wrap with solid as well .
"i had the beat and burrata starter , excellent ."
the winter kale salad was also excellent .
"nice place , watermelon margarita was excellent ."
traditional guac was lacking in flavor .
till next time enjoy yourself and indulge .
room door was open and looked <UNK> .
turns out small mistake had been made .
this is a great place to stay .
there ' s also a cvs near by .
so why miko ' s ?
i certainly ca n't figure it out .
the good : our server kim was awesome .
- ice cream machine broken .
"- lrb - sorry , ken ."
- sold out of sausage .
sides came much later .
i love local bbq joints .
where was ` ` billy ?
"fair prices , too ."
i ' ll never take my cars anywhere else .
wolf will do it right .
not a good thing .
first off - service is always great .
the locations are invariably clean as well .
the problem for me is the food .
and it smells bad .
oh roberto ' s you had so much promise .
what shall i say about whiskey dick ' s ?
if you want standard service go somewhere else .
update - the burgers are quite good too .
service is always very good here .
the shepherd ' s pie is very good though .
there are also <UNK> and contests .
the price was a little steep for delivery though .
"again , what i got was pretty good ."
to elaborate - great place to eat .
this place is all about bears .
as for the food - hell to the yeah .
"they load them up with food , too ."
"for the record , their blackberry cobbler is fantastic ."
service was good and fast .
ca n't go wrong with this place .
friendly and enthusiastic staff .
excellent customer service and great work done .
super friendly staff and great service and food .
went in for some sushi and was not disappointed .
the pita bread is phenomenal .
chipotle you let me down .
tables not wiped down .
chairs looking in dire need of replacement .
when the soup came i was floored .
after the last visit i will stay elsewhere .
bring good shoes to avoid a <UNK> ankle .
they insist that it is the same recipe .
this is as good or better than bellagio .
the deserts were very nice also .
got the spicy chicken while waiting for my flight .
also the chefs were asian as well .
there are better places to eat in vegas .
this place is getting ghetto .
great breakfast when staying at the hotel .
top notch sushi at an amazing price .
i eat here at least once a month .
nice location near the light rail .
i ordered pho with thin sliced beef and tendon .
love the waffles and the cornbread is fantastic .
friendly staff and good service .
most folks were moderately enthused .
"all came away delighted , i think ."
we would rent with them again .
this place desperately needs a courtesy patrol .
the strawberry <UNK> was fantastic .
very courteous and professional .
very courteous and professional .
"on the menu , they were called <UNK> <UNK> ."
the decor is absolutely mexican style .
location and atmosphere are nice .
"in this case , bagel <UNK> breakfast and lunch ."
i recommend this place .
do n't expect a huge menu or fancy setting .
try the vietnamese sweet and sour soup .
this place is awesome .
i was there on friday sept 00th .
everyone seemed ready to party and down to earth .
i was at the club on sept 00th saturday .
i guess it was one of my <UNK> day .
was sold the <UNK> .
this restaurant does not disappoint .
this meal did not disappoint .
ca n't wait to bring my wife here .
unfortunately it was neither hot nor tasted great .
i do not recommend .
after dinner at the aquaknox with my girlfriend .
the aquaknox is located in venetian hotel and casino .
"good food , good atmosphere and good service ."
the show was awesome .
would recommended to pair it with white wine .
- served on top of a toasted bread .
every act was very impressive through out the show .
serves two to four .
we were watching <UNK> usa vs . england .
small but convenience located on the east side tower .
how do you mess this old school classic up ?
how do you ruin a mixed green salad ?
the <UNK> gravy needed salt .
still no true greek restaurant in charlotte .
mixed bag on the food / service .
this place is great .
<UNK> is top notch .
the service is kinda shit though .
i recommend the squash curry .
try the scotch ale .
definitely the best i have had in recent memory .
this is a better place for lunch than dinner .
a bit expensive for what you are getting .
one pie is enough for a hungry person .
"both were good , crabcakes could be spicier ."
great place to get some healthy fast food .
i guess they never bothered to renovate .
however i would avoid the soup .
the stout is the best beer on tap .
they tend to overcook the burgers so adjust accordingly .
this place is the shit for tacos and gorditas .
why am i even writing this ?
the special events are on point .
cant see it staying open too long .
"great service , great people !"
the family style approach goes a long way .
all the guys there are awesome ! !
but my girlfriends farm burger was really tasty .
i highlight recommend this place .
great food from genuine great people .
fat sandwich steals your soul and <UNK> your spirit .
"do n't eat there , for your own good ."
the pizza is the best in town .
this dealership is a joke ... absolute garbage .
the meat had no taste .
"besides this , not bad for a cheap buffet ."
it was texas bbq night .
the sage stuffing was also worth mentioning .
but that was about it for the good food .
the rest of the dishes were not too good .
i had the miso ramen .
first time was almost 0 years ago .
i guess wheat penne is expensive .
the flavour of both dishes also needs some improvement .
the finish product looked great .
the broth was quite tasty .
next time i will also try their bbq meats .
finally went there for lunch last week .
an empty restuarant is not a good sign .
i guess the lunch crowd starts at 0pm here .
the burgers were very fresh and inviting .
my wife was n't as impressed as i was .
oil and filter - rrb - .
fast service and nice people working there .
i was in and out in about 00 mins .
the char shu was grilled perfectly .
stop by and try some of their wonderful cuisine .
the skewers were only a buck .
it was very quite inside .
they have quite a big selection of menu items .
"wow , i was blown away ."
their other bbq meats also looked good .
save your money and go elsewhere .
"surprisingly , this place tasted quite good ."
they were well worth the money .
both dishes were quite good and fulfilling .
quite a few <UNK> chow style dishes .
the sweet potato fries were quite good .
the beef was soft and tasty .
for a buck you ca n't go wrong .
"ok , here is my final review ."
last time we ate here was 0 years ago .
the stew hot pot was also a disappointment .
definitely not with the price for $ 00 .
the best thing was the portuguese pork chop rice .
the tonkotsu and shoyu ramen were excellent .
the thick noodle was cooked to perfection .
the fried rice was also very good .
0/0 star off for those thin sliced char siu .
so only 0.0 stars from me .
the price is right .
what happened to the customer satisfaction .
i have to give this dish an average rating .
did they run out of noodles today ?
you also get two scoops of rice with it .
a big disappointment for my wife .
the place was quite busy though .
but not worth the half hour trip there .
kalbi ribs and ribeye were excellent .
did n't get a chance to sample everything .
the service was excellent .
their hot menu items are also quite good too .
great facility and great location .
overall not bad for a fast food joint .
this place opens till 0 in the morning daily .
i like the ambiance of this place .
very tasty and moist .
the slice i had was not that moist .
you get quite a thick burger on the slider .
there was nothing that was extraordinarily good .
the chocolate crã ¨ me brulee was quite good .
they just opened one up in <UNK> .
this ramen place did not disappoint .
i give 0.0 stars .
the flavour of this curry is the bomb .
once up there the view is quite scenic .
i must come back to try their other dishes .
"unfortunately , that is not the case here ."
all the dishes were on the bland side .
no rave reviews here .
i saw more new menu items on the wall .
they both were quite good .
well for me it was a little disappointing .
this place is not your ordinary vietnamese pho restaurant .
second the soup was oh so bland .
three dishes for $ 00 including tips .
customer service is top notch here .
the food is n't bad either .
they also had new york steak cooked medium .
i had the deluxe ramen ... .
and my wife had their special tonkotsu ramen .
the flavour of the ramen soup was quite good .
this place did n't disappoint .
we went to have taiwanese breakfast on sunday morning .
the flavor of the beef could also be improved .
they were giving away free pizza and soft drinks .
my second time here was much better .
i was impressed with the quality of the meal .
their handmade soup noodles were quite good too .
two thumbs up though .
the rest is just liquid curry .
it was like watered down curry .
not at all what it should be like .
anita is very knowledgeable about the tax laws .
had my paperwork done when i got there .
very disappointing meal not worth the money .
one of <UNK> <UNK> shoes would taste better .
"i had the sauerbraten , which was absolutely fantastic ."
washed it all down with an asahi draft .
another waitress came over and helped me .
"i said no , just the bill ."
"the restaurant was busy , but was well staffed ."
the food was disappointing to outright bad .
food came out cold .
everything was ok until a few hours later .
i felt cold and had the <UNK> .
so i then ordered green mussels 0 ways .
' ' with a deep bow .
next step : better business bureau then court .
awesome atmosphere for a group or a romantic dinner .
my wife had fettuccine alla <UNK> .
it was a wonderful dish .
it had just the right amount sauce and seasonings .
there is outdoor seating and approximately 00 seats inside .
my girlfriend went with the chicken parmesan sandwich .
the burrito was good with plenty of meat .
i look forward too more samplings from this place .
wow my second visit and just as amazing .
if your a rueben lover as i am .
the table was cramped and falling apart .
call them and its a run around .
some of the best mediterranean food in the valley .
total wine ... tried all the beer there .
try the sampler plate trust me its amazing .
they do good bbq .
long long wait if your late check .
line out the door sat and sun .
in my opinion this place is worth the wait .
$ 00 00 for a hamburger ?
come on ... a $ 0 shake .
"yes , i ate here ."
it came to $ 00 with tip .
shame on you guys !
a perfect 0 * .
"excellent selection , great service and quality food ."
i always go here for any tire related issue !
super tasty and super friendly wait staff .
large portions at a good price .
super clean and nice .
had an outdoor sitting area with misters as well .
arrived and was told it was a hour wait .
was told ` ` cleaning table now ' ' .
over two hour wait after told an hour .
: - lrb - pizza was weak !
this place is great !
and for the cost of mcdonald ' s !
this review is for the restaurant inside .
just like the feel of this place .
the room has great lighting .
better than others from a food and ambiance standpoint .
the sauces were also much more flavorful too .
for sure a perfect place to watch football .
stayed at the mirage on new years eve .
was prepared to buy $ 000 worth .
no people skills whatsoever .
the service has become progressively worse .
"very inexperienced cashiers , and sales staff ."
"first , two burgers ."
"then , after that , my well done fries ."
"by that time , my burger was totally cold ."
your a rib and burger place !
water came in a dixie cup .
i ' ve been several times now .
this place is a joke .
"i dont have a box , or a remote ."
i have ` ` reception only ' ' cable .
love the <UNK> bacon cheeseburger !
great service as well .
a they have a great bar as well .
actually brought people from out of town here .
the blond girl today was a total <UNK> .
do n't wait for this place .
they have good size portions and a good selection .
their pulled pork and beans are great !
lots of tv ' s and decent beer selection .
lots of beers to choose from at this place .
this is a local watering hole .
staff was pleasant and quick .
bonus they have cold beer on tap .
the <UNK> fries and <UNK> ketchup was delicious .
i ' ll be coming back for sure .
the best sushi ive had in a my life .
' ' and put her phone away .
she said twenty dollars .
"not because the people <UNK> nice , they were ."
the cars simply were not there .
management needs to give these people some help .
i made an act .
just so i can rate this place .
floors seem to be not mopped in days .
disgusted that you at at this place .
<UNK> what this place is .
this place ai n't a franchise .
they sell fishing bait up front .
the staff treats you like family .
the place is <UNK> be yourself .
very well executed kansas city style barbecue .
meats are all perfectly done .
undoubtedly the best barbecue restaurant in anthem .
this place is a time <UNK> .
you almost expect to see frank sinatra in here !
maybe i caught them on a bad day .
most of the former employees were gone .
the beef is actually pretty good .
. the sauce very good .
the meat portions are very small .
"the sides , especially the beans , are ok ."
the rolls <UNK> cars looked really good .
overall coming here once was enough .
"the interiors , decorations and <UNK> were really nice ."
the only thing good here were the desserts .
"for this reason , i take away one star ."
do what you have to do .
this place gets crowded a lot .
the <UNK> in the resort is horrible .
really deserves 0.0 stars .
the prices here seemed reasonable .
the nightlife in here was pretty cool .
prices there range from cheap to very pricey .
the employees are friendly and the food is good .
"a very nice , and big mall ."
"it looked good , and it was very tasty ."
these guys are amazing .
should have checked yelp first !
excellent selection of heavy snacks and seating was great .
i would avoid this gym .
this place was packed .
"music overall was good , not that great ."
i had the pho tai nam <UNK> .
i actually came back 00hours later for this .
$ 00 for 0 people ... not bad .
packed out here as well .
the theatre is a large stadium style seating .
the stage itself is very nice and well done .
the big baby throughout the show is also entertaining .
the broth was pipping hot and clear .
the rooms itself are very spacious .
there were funny parts as well sad parts .
this place is very nice on the outside .
it was just us and like 0-0 other patrons .
this place is really nice on the inside .

nothing really stood out .
"it is newer , nicer , bigger ."
stayed here for bachelor party .
because mr . <UNK> won big after this meal .

ordered 0 salumi meat app .
"good food , not to far from strip ."
and cheaper then most places around .
corey and the old man appeared .
"ok then when corey says this , you laugh ."
diner food but decent draft beer .
not much else to say .
all hail tony <UNK> .
the best thai food i ' ve ever had .
they ' re only occasionally not terrible .
except at this place .
"just terrible , even for a 00 hour cafe ."
"this place looks great , right ?"
"not there to gamble , just to have breakfast ."
- rrb - vodka with a touch of tabasco .
very friendly service but that ' s about it .
total <UNK> from start to finish .
` ` arrested for eating an <UNK> <UNK> dragon ?
prime view of the fremont street experience .
as in visiting <UNK> well .
the food was absolutely fantastic .
this will definitely be a spot we visit frequently .
"friendly , helpful staff ."
new favorite sunday morning date spot with my wife .
we stopped by after the neon museum for lunch .
the staff was gracious and courteous .
we all left full and satisfied .
best off strip lunch and breakfast spot .
i ' ve expect more from this joint !
we all had a really good time .
the wynn buffet was really good .
"great selection , great food and excellent service ."
the lamb was just unbelievable .
"excellent drinks , <UNK> and atmosphere ."
flying back past the strip was awesome .
the good : their fries are amazing .
the bad : cheese curds .
these were a waste of about $ 0 .
the largest cheese curd was smaller than a marble .
the bottom line : solid sandwich and burger menu .
seafood in a bag ... .
no one does it better than hot n juicy .
one of the gems in vegas off the strip .
the intro : the chef of the century .
the only michelin 0 starred restaurant in vegas .
everything was spectacular from start to finish .
very very classy and elegant .
the best dish was the caviar over dungeness crab .
"nice atmosphere , nice staff , and nice food ."
done with this location dirty and poorly run .
the food is the worst .
it really <UNK> me that this place sucks .
"wall of sports , ca n't go wrong ..."
"a new place , only opened yesterday ."

might be a $ 0 item .
food is priced very modestly .
best crossfit gym in the valley hands down !

the lunch special is very good and reasonably priced .
manager <UNK> the bartender but ask for my number .
not a single complaint .
<UNK> is awesome ! ! .
i would recommend this team to anyone .
<UNK> good pizza ... great dough !
and this place is no exception .
no complaints about the food .
they stand around their ordering computer screen and bullshit .
"so , yeah , food is fine ."
definitely not the best buffet in vegas .
been to all 0 locations .
had a bad experience at windmill .
fries are always great .
the sauce is great .
great place to go when you want something different .
first time trying a sushi burrito .
a bit small but enough to satisfy you .
"the sushi here is edible , but nothing special ."
all dealers are mean comparing to other casinos .
i know the service industry very well .
we were seated fast with a reservation .
the manager came back red faced and apologetic .
the omelette is a great portion .
walked in got a window seat for four .
seriously what are you waiting for ?
$ 00 all you can eat tacos and margaritas .
"so , i recommend eating there ."
the sandwiches here are filling .
just not good pizza .
the pizza here is way undercooked .
i recommend the hibachi grill .
"good choice , i <UNK> ."
the bread was pretty good and tasted fresh .
"the staff is real cool , too ."
the wait staff was excellent as well .
i highly recommend hot frank ' s .

great menu and wine list .
it truthfully caught me off guard .

the place is really nice and clean inside .
a friend of mine also went there .
you will be lied to .
the staff is no helpful or competent .
they do n't take care of things for you .
the kitchen work was spotty .
you will hate living here .
the staff is friendly and great to converse with .
nice beer selection also .
stay far away from this place .
he guessed all of our characters correctly .
talk about an attitude of gratitude .
family owned and operated with a corporate look .
request a <UNK> upper floor .
our room was like 00 bucks .
had brakes done there today .
we were then treated to an <UNK> .
bachi ' s is a <UNK> secret .
wifey and i starting to come here more frequently .
but you need to be a bit more humble .
no spoon on an italian table ?
unfortunate but true it was .
i told him to read about it on yelp !
what you see on tv is staged .
my cold cold martini was cool at best .
butter with pretzels sucked .
had to ask for mustard .
taste terrible ca n't eat it .
left it on the plate .
wife ' s wine was good .
wife said we should have gone for asian food .
out of 0 eaters the average <UNK> was 0.0 .
bill was $ 000 tipped ... $ 00 .
"we wont likely be back , sorry todd ..."
never come back to the hotel as a result .
service and manager was friendly .

"sushi is excellent , service spotty at times ."
excellent food and service and very affordable .

however my bill was 00.00 .
the cream of vegetable was excellent .
great for a romantic dinner setting .
can wholeheartedly recommend the lamb chops and skirt steak .

service is attentive but a little rushed .
do n't expect your mainstream spanish fair .
more eclectic food choices .
my experience is simple .
thank you david and <UNK> for .
making the evening an experience to write about .
class act ... thank you chris .
the fries was also great .
hope this review helped .
we were certainly not treated with any respect .
"in addition , the atmosphere here is great ."
these slices were massive .
the great food and service was surprisingly inexpensive .
- lrb - how cool is that ?
that ' s not what i found .
it turned a good experience into a great one .
i walk in to ask for a quote .
the room and place is ghetto .
me no likey ghetto .
this place has good music and great coffee .
fresh and tasty ingredients .
i ' m certainly glad i tried this place .
the bone marrow flan was very interesting and unique .
there was nothing wagyu about it .
but man it was worth the wait .
i went there hungry and almost died before eating .
she was jus spotty .
. the game changer .
it was cooked just right .
the evening was great .
the pizza crust is a thin crust and crispy .
the only negative is that the line is long .
we probably had to wait 00-00 minutes to order .
the sandwich was very tasty .
highly recommend this place .
it had a very nice bubble gum favor .
i absolutely enjoyed my hamburger and onion rings .
my wife likes smashburger a bit better .
"overall , their food is very good ."
maybe the best szechwan food in the east valley .
"good food , ok service ."
the room was a good size .
no outside drinks are allowed .
my girlfriend did not like her eggs and bacon .
the service was acceptable .
the fish was cooked perfectly and very tasty .
def worth spreading the word about .
copper and stainless steel : - rrb -
save your bucks for more satisfying food .
but the restrooms are in need of some assistance .
"excellent food , but terrible service ."
excellent live music venue in tempe .
"my band , <UNK> <UNK> , plays there often ."
i ' m glad the <UNK> inn is back .
they also give guitar lessons .
great staff great food .
monte carlo is awesome .
"they have great dining , and good gambling ."
overall this place is just not that bad .
luckily the parking is easy in and easy out .
this place is awesome .
its a fucking line .
unfortunately nothing changed over the remaining half hour .
other than that everything was good .
but the casino is a lot of fun .
00 % or at least a free drink .
totally professional and over exceeded my expectations .
mr . kevin <UNK> should be proud .
"great sides friendly staff , very casual ."
i ordered the shoyu ramen .
<UNK> would recommend using them again .
was happy with austin son of owner i think .
<UNK> miso marinated cod .
talk is cheap ... <UNK> is inexpensive .
"eat here , drink here ."
"0 days later , still nothing , no calls ."
just saw the new indian jones movie .
"what a surprise , no line , at all ."
not sure what sound system we had .
and a shocker to some degree .
maybe 00 total tables in the place available .
good clean room too .
blackened pepper w / eel .
and the <UNK> mentioned pigs ear .
hot & sour soup .

"this day , not even a cell phone conversation ."
but i ' m finding that everywhere here .
"yep , a dive bar alright ."
kiss me i ' m irish ?
gay bar part of town .
or <UNK> off tropicana if coming from below .
genuine <UNK> bamboo and palm details .
"not a big room , seats maybe 000 max ."
the staff was genuine and friendly .
although their specialty pancakes look impressive as hell .
food is certainly worthy here .
probably not as a party of one .
majority rules will have to win that one .
"but , your mileage may vary ."
hell yeah ! ! excellent facility .
but the quality of upkeep is excellent .
giving me a bit more room .
a t-shirt or two tossed in .
and proving that i need to lose weight .
more than i already knew .
got my smog certificate .
now just needed my official license plates .
i missed my old reg .
not bad for a friday ?
best breakfast in town in my opinion .

better be a packer ' s fan .
i like this place .
restaurant & bar was hopping .
"once again , excellent visit to the draft house !"

http://url ahhhh ` comfort food ' ' .
bun was a bit hard .
a higher end applebee ' s .
if that means anything .
cooking and presentation were great .
service was genuine and attentive .
probably will of you too .
the kid crowd almost lost that 0rd star though .
the roads out here are a work in progress .
these directions should be fine though .
located in the miracle mall at planet hollywood .
and this was a 0:00 showing .
i was blown away .
one act i thought was funny as hell .
"i laughed , wtf ?"
toxic audio should make your short list .
because i have nothing else to compare with .
that is just plain dumb .
just ended up here .
could become crowded easy .
one interesting caveat ... 00/00 .
food has nice portions and are well prepared .
but that ' s a whole other ball game .
"breakfast , lunch & dinner ."
probably seat 00-00 for dining .
so smoke is wafting in from the bar ?
the explanation i got still is n't crystal clear .
mixed bag as far as age range .
check it out if you will .
food is a great value .
"velvety mashed potatoes , nice rich brown gravy ."
turn off the damn tv .
pipe some music in .
"draft beer pint $ 0.00 , domestic $ 0.00 ?"
but the bar has been generous in the past .
these are the menu prices .
the plank did n't have one spot open .
"las vegas , i do n't really know you ."
and by town i mean off-strip .
forward ho ! ! red rocks canyon .

"if not , they should ."
if not i should also deduct a star ... .
it ' s a large menu .
you are welcome to eat a full menu there .
interesting variety well executed .

i almost exclusively go to qt .
wish the prices were a little lower .
i almost exclusively go to qt .

"they are true professionals and , they care ."
thanks again for all the help and advice !

this is my first five star rating .
i kinda feel bad for giving allegro two stars .

wagyu beef sliders - the best thing all night .

you ' ll most likely be drunk though .
the el caliente burger was decent .
secret pizza is some good ass pizza .
the hallway is stacked with italian album covers .
the cheese pizza was probably the best .
that ' s all you need to know .
the hunters waffles and the french toast .
another steakhouse in vegas that gets the job done .
it was rich and had a full flavor .

this steak was <UNK> .
the bone in ribeye was perfect .
"medium rare , juice oozed out , flavor exploded ."
"honestly , i want to live in the steak ."
it was a blast ! ! ! attractive staff .
. awesome dancers ... no cover .
kevin the owner really knows his stuff .
that is single gender and must be naked .
cost 00 dollars with no locals discount .
but lets talk about beer selection .
daily specials and great prices on drinks already .
kabuki <UNK> i would say second .
this place was a close second .
"try it , you wont be disappointed ."
kabuki is one of these restaurants .
just a good meal and a lite lunch .
kabuki seems to run a tight ship .
mark is the man !
i have eaten here many times .
both of which are great .
the food comes out fast and hot .
"burgers , fries , hot dogs , etc . ."
eventually they kicked her out .

the vig is outstanding .
one word : wow .
prolly in the thousands .
"ill be back , next year ."
i have been to bb many ' o times .
"standard , unimaginative pizza and other italian food ."
the summation of this effort is pizza rock .
but it has soccer and a lovely beer selection .
and the food lived up to the atmosphere .
my only knock is the bread .
both were nifty little numbers .
bww is actually one of my favorite chain restaurants .
the happy hour merlot is perfectly drinkable .
i generally loathe pt ' s .
i am a fan of dive bars .
i practically lived in them in chicago .
"i get it , you are a dive bar ."
<UNK> is a hip bar .
the cocktails are quality and the service is great .
my first visit to this place was underwhelming .
maybe i am just not hip anymore .
the food was not bad .
the service on the other hand was wretched .
she also had the personality of a brick wall .

the setting and presentation are meticulously executed .
both were unimaginative and mediocre .
"when we visited , the place was largely empty ."
the octopus crostini was outstanding .
"<UNK> , was it a good choice ."
most <UNK> was the service .
it lives up to the hype rather well .
i had the roasted chicken .
ra has fast-food quality sushi .
"still , their happy hour has some value ."
the service was slow and forgettable .
"uninspired , dull , disjointed , and a bore ."
s & f specializes in bulk food .
the best selection and prices .
<UNK> is a small hole-in-the-wall joint .
you ' ll thank me later .
jun ' s is a nice and easy introduction .
both were a bit underwhelming .
the atmosphere is nice enough .
this is where to get meat in vegas .
these are the best cuts in town .
i do have two knocks .
it is model ny pizza and nothing more .
this is the best coffee house in the valley .
the fat choy burger was delightful .
it was perfectly bold without being overpowering and delicious .
it was almost like a <UNK> .
you pay for what you get .
"these <UNK> details cost money , yelpers ."
the service was attentive .
bar + bistro is a perfectly adequate restaurant .
diner food done at a typical diner level .
the food is a <UNK> from normal bar food .
"with that said , it is still bar food ."
none of the beers have impressed .
the internet has almost rendered <UNK> like these <UNK> .
great addition to this part of town .
three star food in a five star setting .
it is straight forward chicago pizza .
this place is about as standard as pizza gets .
"if not , there are plenty of better options ."
everything is rather standard .
"yes , whole foods is expensive ."
other favorites include the biancoverde and wiseguy .
both dishes are incredible .
the fried brussels sprouts were simple and awesome .
charlie may be my favorite server in vegas .
solid chicago style thin-crust pizza .
the atmosphere was satisfactory .
- rrb - dealings in the parking area .
"in one word , bland ."

the food we had was all solid .
the pickles were decent .
the cuban was dry and tasteless .
it is a poorly <UNK> dive bar .
the ravioli was excellent .
our service was adequate and friendly .
this was a great coup for downtown .
marcus was <UNK> with this suggestion .
none of them appeared to be under 00 .
the food here is second to none .
and that is all you need .
the salads are spot-on and the pizza is <UNK> .
there are often creative and great daily dishes .
the portions here are obnoxious .
it is an odd thing to have .
the dish just <UNK> me .
- lrb - which is a good thing .
"the bartender , trevor , was excellent ."
what else could you ask for ?
"check , check , and check ."
"bravo , <UNK> rabbit !"
aces & ales has a wonderful craft beer selection .
sprouts is cheaper alternative to whole foods .
it has a real diy feel to it .
this place features style on a budget .
i browsed through this store with my girlfriend .
i frequent this joint on saturday during the daytime .
now back to that name .
the pork was very juicy .
i would have no problem eating here again .
for those that care .
the men ' s restroom was very clean .
had the margherita pizza slice .
having thus slice i wanted more .
some of the highlights include : 0 .
great selection of desert 0 .
the worst is probably the service .
that is where this joint stands out .
the decor is decidedly <UNK> but not overbearing .
the expansion has largely been positive .
the sound quality has always been very good .
the sight lines are pretty clear .
my oldest was crawling during her first visit .
staff and cooks are friendly .
not like other places i know in the hood .
been coming here for years now .
the box combo is usually your best deal .
not even worth one star in any book !
"if you like pork , two words ."
double the price of most pho half the taste .
pho bosa a few mins away is far greater .
the food was phenomenal and very satisfying .
stopped in to see about an oil change .
i almost gave up .
then i came across a review for las <UNK> .
fills a needed niche in the west end .
sunday is jazz day on the patio .

this shop is nothing short of amazing .
the staff was friendly and the place was clean .
best instructors who care and very supportive staff .
food was excellent and freshly made with great service .
nice addition to restaurant .

this place is nicely kept and serene inside .
you cant beat it .
". very clean , nice stores ."
you get the south point casino .
this place was not my choice .
. and thats how i ended up here .
"a nice show , that should have been perfect ."
. three or four rows from the stage .
this review is for the casino area .
"nice layout , i love the central park area ."
great job by american express .
free catered buffett that is really tasty and recommended .
they should have these in every major airport .
. it was the only decent coffee around .
the guacamole that topped taquitos was poor .
all in all not a great meal .
i wo n't be doing business with them again .
"great food , unique atmosphere , and great prices ."
not quite what it used to be .
food is decent and the beer is ice cold .
"a really weird place , definitely a hipster place ."
their beer selection is awful .
eggs benedict were good not great .
good american breakfast place .
counter service only here .
why they have tables is a mystery .
my wife says best mac n cheese ever !
felt like i was in the best restaurant ever .
places were very reasonable given the quality .
service was the only sub par thing here .
which i usually do .
daily special is great but everything is fresh .

the pizzas we ordered were : 0 .

what a pleasant surprise .
good food and cheap .
chef chris did an outstanding job on the cake .
they move slower then molasses .

0 - rrb - decline the insurance .
not as good as some other places around .
. i thought my buddies were messing with me .
"the new location is way , way better ."
i never had anything bad here .
this is one of those places .
chicken was perfectly roasted .
some great bakers they ' ve got .

the dim sum dumplings are excellent .
the grotto italian restaurant was good .
- the room was serviceable .
this is real authentic jalisco mexican food .

the meat ... cooked perfectly .
"for dinner , try any of the cheese tapas ."

the space is stunning .
the hamachi tataki was impressive yet small .
still too heavy however .

wont find a ipa or a stout here though .
staff is friendly but lacking enthusiasm .

"not the case , it was unbelievably worse ."
everything was left clean and in place .
top notch burgers are outdone by their fresh <UNK> !
this place has good food and great service .
i would highly recommend this place .
this place is horrible .
we do n't typically complain in person or pen .
things went downhill from there .
there were about two or three screaming kids .
no call back as mentioned on the web site .
huge failure on the part of your business .
not the service i expect from them .
you cant go wrong with any of them .
the steak was cooked to perfection .
we also had the charged peppers .
the casino is deceptively large .
toilet had a <UNK> <UNK> - lrb - tmi ?

this was kind of weird .
"couple of negatives here , however ."
prices are moderately high but acceptable .
soda is either bottles or cans .
it ' s a bit rustic yet mostly clean .
they have a nice selection of beer .
most of the customers including us were older .
very creative spin on hot dogs and very tasty .

prime rib thursday is worth the trip .
very tasty and even the small portion was generous .
installation was done in less than 00 hours .
place is simply awesome .
it was a 0 - star club experience .
the stuff they learn in school ?
"dentist , physician , chiropractor , whatever ."
"great staff , strong it <UNK> ."
i would still come back to this place .
"you ' re awesome , sur la table scottsdale ."
not nice but it is clean .

the food was pretty good .
my girlfriend ordered the breakfast sandwich with sausage .

this place is great .
' ' with a big smile .
need quality shoes from a knowledgeable salesman ?
look forward to heading back there again sometime soon .
the pizza came out and it was even worse .
i quickly escaped and never looked back .
moral of the story : run .
this time was definitely worse than the first .
this trip was different .
they have a doorman to let you in .
happy hour from 0 until close everyday ?
"overall , not a bad place ."
the problem was the service .
great place to come for one or two drinks .
there are much better places around .
every part of this place is great .
"then add in their food , and its amazing ."
' ' definitely a good time .
the green beans are n't anything special .
"they provide eat-in , take-out and free delivery ."
my wife loves the <UNK> pot pie !
i ca n't recommend this place strongly enough .
this is the place to go in vegas .
the soda fountain was broken .
every thing i tried was to hard to stomach .
besides most korean <UNK> cant be wrong .
nothing really to complain about there .
"chargrilled and potato rolls , ca n't go wrong ."
the server / bartender was very friendly .
the problem was with the meal itself .
not enough food or quality for that amount .
my review is primarily for the lunch buffet .
the pizzas are fresh .
me and my girlfriend are visiting from california .
gave us a free donut as well .
must try breakfast burrito .
this place was good .
but great business with great workers and location .
he said that my id was not valid .
"however , ordering turned out to be more difficult ."
would recommend the chicken kabob .
their food is fresh and always tastes good .
too bad they do n't open on sundays .
definitely the best brewery in arizona !
the place smelled like a bathroom .
"no problems there , but nothing special at all ."
my girlfriend really liked the chicken wings .
just go try it before you bash me .
a nice place to stay on the vegas strip .
great hotel and casino .
this is pretty much criminal .
pepper steak was terrible .
one guy on the floor as a result .
way overpriced rooms and bar with <UNK> poured drinks .
only thing good about this hotel was the location .
the sandwich was well piled but not overly so .
also the house special chow main is phenomenal .
great food and friendly people .
i keep having the chicken fried steak .
so tender you can cut it with a fork !
"service is great , fast and attentive ."
some of the best burgers around !
"good service , great food ."
fries are great and crispy but again overly salted .
00 beers on tap !
what a difference from just a month ago .
food and beer are priced right .

my goto is the california tacos .
very reasonable pricing too .
half rack was $ 00.00 .
". daughter had a burger , $ 00.00 ."
. will keep this short .
"we hit bellagio , paris and mandalay bay buffets ."
. you get the picture .
"we did bellagio , mandalay bay and paris ."
paris buffet review is for breakfast / lunch .
bellagio buffet seemed over rated .
. i rented online .
. ' ' very pushy .
. different agent says .
. i would avoid these guys .
food and drinks cheaper than the strip for sure .
i think this subway has a training problem !
large selection of weapons .
from a novice perspective they did a great job .
great for tourists but not a tourist trap .
recommended with 0 stars .
a classic case of bait and switch .
i would be very careful when dealing with nationwide .
stopped in for a box of <UNK> .
been there twice now .
had pizza first time .
did not need <UNK> later .
had veal <UNK> tonight .
give it a try .
"without getting <UNK> , all was a0 ."

nice decor and clean .

the beers on tap are great .

andrew jackson is the reason for that .
it ' s a classic mom-and-pop hole-in-the-wall .
the beer is good !
some bad design choices .
avoid at all costs .
"being vegas , you can do better ."
the real treat however was the burger .
ketchup would have destroyed this exquisitely crafted creation .
i was actually kind of shocked by this place .
my filet was cooked to order and seasoned well .
"bad form , delmonico ."
sticky rice is a must with this dish .
not satisfied at all <UNK> the burgers .

the old location would usually be moderately busy .
but not like it is now .
they are usually friendly though .
both nikki and jessie are great bartenders .
i had the farm burger .
turkey bacon is so common .
from out of town .
the tuna roll was well presented in another container .
i will be back again .
a friend suggested this place .
this is las vegas ' version of kfc .
this is a small business that is worth supporting .
"these are the full length , original productions ."
this reminds me of a small family type restaurant .
glad they rebuild the restaurant .
"good appetizers , underseasoned main , good desserts ."
expensive as compared to the quality of the food .
expensive and too much five spices in the broth .
the dj line up is out of the park .
people in here work hard and mean business .
then you have the back stretch of the facility .
tons of places nearby to eat and see .
"facility : rooms are clean , new and excellent ."
grounds are very well kept and parking is plentiful .
00 % not bad .
cooking here has an obvious asian influence .
come here for this if nothing else .
service is about average .
it might as well be ` mystery meat ' .
i have provided a few links on snake rivers .
the bun is more <UNK> .
flavors here are very robust and well paired together .
the flavors felt very vietnamese to me .
come here for this dish if nothing else .
i feel the flavors were a bit muted .
"again , it takes the dish to another level ."
maybe the actual cut of the meat was poor .
the condiments and wine pairing once again are stellar .
the pairing itself is conservative but effective nonetheless .
http://url not a part of my tasting menu .
"i ordered the steak rare , but came medium ."
overall it was a quite boring steak .
style of cooking is relatively old fashioned .
i just would n't recommend adding their wagyu steak .
picasso is very organized and the pacing is consistent .
there are few places more efficiently run than picasso .
- lrb - dish rating 00 % .
- lrb - dish rating 00 % .
"nonetheless , it was great lighter , refreshing dish ."
the lobster itself was great .
"texture wise , it was quite tender for lobster ."
the condiments are well thought out as well .
it took an already accomplished dish to another level .
"continued , please refer to ` earlier review ' ."
* * * short review very daring experimental cuisine .
"excellent top notch service , possibly the best ever ."
i do n't think everyone will enjoy it .
most of it worked .
this focuses more on the experimental cuisine .
there is an outrageously high emphasis on dessert courses .
half the tasting menu dishes were ` desserts ' .
amuse bouche dishes also have a consistent dessert theme .
"dining environment very modern , although a tad cold ."
highly recommended for the adventurous .
pretty good oil change place .
the convenience of the operation is also quite reasonable .
continued from first review .
this was much better .
flavors complement the caviar very well .
close to perfect dish .

there are many good restaurants within 00-00 mins drive .
maid service was immaculate after cleaning .
- rooms could benefit from a <UNK> .
- toilet paper is pretty low grade .
i really enjoyed breadfruit .
hopefully my future encounters will be better .
rules not that important .
go there get drunk enjoy the people .
great tasting and variety of hot dogs .
a must try for anyone visiting fountain hills .
$ 0.00 plus each .

lots of dirty tables that need to be cleaned .

i arrived at 0:00 pm .
i called out and nobody came .
i said ` ` there you are .
maybe there should be two employees working ?
' ' save yourself and drive right on by .
much more than western style hats !
chris <UNK> and his team are simply the best .
"now , to the food ."
a fantastic lunch spot .
this place was a pleasant surprise .
not bad but not great .
great location and nothing else needs to be said .
maybe a renovation on the parking lot .
<UNK> knows how to do it up .
hurry up and help save this place .
let me count how many ways this place sucks .
i say that to say this .
probably the worst customer service in arizona .
very interesting menu and in a good way .
this place is old school and definitely <UNK> .
this is like a once a month place .
very unique mexican joint .
high quality food with no frills .
read tempe r ' s review .
this place is awesome .
just do n't ever do the wing challenge .
everyone i recommend has the same positive experience .

the problem there lies in getting their attention .
overall it was still ok .
food here is great .
the service was very good as well .
i came to get my 00 toyota avalon inspected .
the chips were excellent with a subtle ranch seasoning .
their doughnuts were n't as sweet as most doughnuts .
all sorts of unique variety doughnuts .
great tasting coffee and nice / friendly baristas .
fresh <UNK> oj helps pass the time .

this place is a joke .
i have no idea how it gets good reviews .
"and well , nothing special ."
"not bad , not great ."
"well ... ok sure , why not ."
eating a poutine of course .
. the pizza was not what i expected .
with some home made cookie dough inside .
thanks but no thanks .
guess they have to work on that .
give it a try .
nothing fancy to catch your eyes .
"and damn , that was good ."
it ' s like this place .
and a few seasonal recipes all the time .
they look and taste great .
worth a second try .
nice place to grab a quick healthy bite .
"a <UNK> to pass this all down , average ."
i never reviewed le saint bock ?
really nice place to go if you like rum .
yeah i just do n't get it .
with a capital c like ... .
food was great and atmosphere equally enjoyable .
poor excuse for a gentleman ' s store .
the glass of wine i had was quite good .
clearly customer service is not a priority at central .
"in all honesty , the food was pretty good ."
the crust was hard and flavorless .
this was a mistake .
avoid this place at all costs .
friendly service and consistent quality .
food quality was top notch .

purchased toys online for pickup at this location .
the nicest buffet i ' ve eaten at .
you need time to sit and digest between plates .
"the rooms are very nice , clean and comfortable ."
. 00 bucks for the week on 0 device .
the service however just keeps getting worse each time .
"first off , the meat is not carne asada ."
it is chuck steak .

maybe built in 0000 and never remodeled .
"the brisket was good , tender and moist ."
the coleslaw was average .

headed over to filibertos mexican food .
i was curious and hungry .
the fries were a good idea gone kinda bad .
the place does scare my stomach a bit .

there is no real taste challenge here .
everything is buffet safe .
still four stars for what it is .
the butcher even prepared the meats as requested .

last note : the neighborhood is not the greatest .
this review is for my second trip to cph .
well prepared and presented .
i have been here at least 0 times now .
so as you can see i am torn .
interesting but not the best in town .
the pizza is the reason to go here .
i will give them another shot .
doing some good business there .
0/0 star for the great <UNK> feel in back .
yes this is a chain mexican restaurant .
it seems a step ahead of the other chains .
for example spinach enchiladas or bacon wrapped shrimp .
"no problem getting seated , though they were busy ."
there is more than enough food per person .
granted i only needed a new watch battery .
nice personal service deserves a return visit .
"interesting flavors , many options ."
the predicted 00 minute wait was accurate .
my wife got a waffle with bacon .
never had bacon like this before .
it was a thicker cut and seasoned with pepper .
a mall with a ross .
you know the deal .
that last sentence was not an exaggeration .
the clientele here are <UNK> ugly .
"great food , great service ."

the town square location is large and wide open .
the red pepper soup was surprising .
small selection of dishes .
such honesty is rare these days .
no no was in the door and window department .
there food has gone steadily down hill .
"waste your money , time and self respect ."
this place was filthy and hot .
00 bucks a person over the age of 0 .
not worth 0 bucks a person in my eyes .
very simple and plain .
i ca n't stand <UNK> ' s .
all of the shirts came back poorly pressed .
"shame on you , <UNK> ' s ."
will be going back .
"also , no more duck tacos ?"
this place is on point .
"decent , but impersonal service ."
forced 00 % tip for 0 or more .
great little place to grab lunch .
i took my wife for our 00st anniversary .
we heard his same uninspired delivery with other diners .
the food was truly uninspired .
management is asleep at the wheel here .

japan has some of the very best establishments .
eat here and you will not be disappointed .
complaints to management is useless .
typical station casino attitude .
that ' s a long time .

you can do better do your research .
food is ok quality .
someone actually pays attention to authenticity !

better breakfast at new york bagels .
this review <UNK> primarily to a group function .
filet made quite the impression on our staff .
nicely done on the kraut .
tasty combo with the quite spicy brat .
the only drawback was a so-so bun .
the perfect bun upgrade merits that fifth star .
did n't make it out until 00:00 am .
a reservation apparently is not a real reservation here .
"go with avis , national , or enterprise ."
i learned my lesson .
all that aside the food was top notch .
i know i wo n't be disappointed .
overall i would definitely recommend .
there are not many thai places like this .
we also ordered beef <UNK> king .
its on the roof of a centrally located building .
the problem is n't the food though .
good but not great .
this was 0 out of 0 .
kind of tough to mess this up .

00-00 minutes tops to get your food .
this place is amazing .
i had the famous mahi fish tacos .
filiberto style mixed with chipotle as the lay out .
this burrito had huge shrimp and carne asada meat .
this was very original and tasted great .
i would give this 0 stars .
a great break from gambling .
now it rates a two .
the quality of the food has also dropped substantially .
why throw good money after bad ?
this place is a complete fail .
they were playing it fairly loud as well .
the place is looking dirty as well now .
took my dodge ram 0000 here about 0 times .
these guys are fast and very professional .
you get to eat breakfast like the locals .
prices are reasonable and portions are good .
i was pretty impressed with shake shack .

one of my favorite restaurants in the world .

my biggest issue was the burnt ends and brisket .
"he found a couple issues , but nothing major ."
will is a class act .
i highly recommend home pride inspections to anyone .
bbq beef sandwich was good .
i have ordered the chicken strips and the nuggets .
best paint in the world fast quick n easy .
the forth reason is the atmosphere .

now for the good news .
which i have neither .
green chili pork burrito was juicy and delicious .
great variety of fresh tasting meals .
strawberry kiwi green tea and passion black tea .
you told me it was no longer valid .
i then asked again for the $ 0.00 special .
and exactly how much would that cost you ?
they act as clueless as you .
i will be calling your corporate office .
the onion rings are good .
no real heed to return .
pizza is poorly made .
it ruined the pizza .
special sauce is nothing special .
delicious and great flavors and variety .
"slow , inattentive service with very few customers there ."
easily amongst my five worst dining experiences .
went to an apparently new location on rue crescent .
highlights include the following : 0 .

a great place for a snack or a meal .
i have nothing bad to say about their food .
"and , the international language happens to be english ."
it happened to another person as i was paying .
the food is good but the staff lacks .
beyond that i have nothing else to say .
step it up guys !

that ' s why the two stars .
nothing overly stuffy about this place .
most everything is individually sized .
decently fresh seafood with some spices .
- lrb - he also makes good basic pastas .
my friends meal looked very lackluster .
i had some long noodles with bulgogi .

not even a ` ` hello ' ' .
the food was the typical chicken wings and sauces .
it almost reminded me of southern farmhouse french style .
the venison carpaccio was very good .
instead it was substituted with a seafood chowder .
verizon 000 was able to <UNK> the telephone remotely .
the food is good .
the food was overall pretty good .
the food reflects that .
that is what my wife picked up .
it did not matter anyway .
definitely worth the trip from mesa az . .
this is something to see at queen creek .
they found the food good quality .

the lunch buffet is always a treat as well .
one star for the clean facility and friendly staff .
"almost a vinegary hint , maybe ?"
i like the chicken better than the beef .
"return next week , repeat ."
the bread was fresh and toasted just right .
"ok , i ' ll start over ."
"tangy , meaty wings are on the appetizer menu ."
"- bacon , smoky and peppery ."
"- brisket , tender and lean ."
- my wife loved the chicken salad .
ca n't wait to try the bbq chicken .
hence the name tied house .
"it ' s a simple thing , really ."
the ribs and brisket are worth ordering .
what more can you expect for under $ 00 ?
five stars for the brisket alone .
mine is for a fresher slice of pizza .
but the produce is average at best .
not bad but not great for you .
i welcome the addition of <UNK> .
do n't try to hide <UNK> meat by <UNK> .
the burgers are better than the southwestern entrees .

hector the technician was especially impressive .

the presentation and flavor were exceptional .
the price also ca n't be beat .
first visit was two days before nye .
great experience and a surprisingly good value .

no one gave us a second look .
it was an ok portion worthy of getting again .
this location recently <UNK> a <UNK> .

"well , shitty bar food ."
"but man , i ' m a <UNK> ."
that ship has <UNK> .
no one should love running that much .
maybe it was the medication i was on .
some guy on the loud speaker was yelling .
"a bit <UNK> , but it ' s madison ."
you run around the lakes as well .
i did n't expect this in a city run .

that was not the case here .
everything one could expect from a can .
"for some processed , <UNK> , <UNK> food ?"
apparently this place is under new ownership ... .
"this was much , much better ."
i ' m a gold member .
parking on a crazy incline ?

i ' ll tell you a secret .
this place is crazy expensive .
the bulk bins ca n't be outdone .
<UNK> makes some serious bank .
the outside looked spotless though .
this ai n't gon na work .
you need to look at it again .
the idle was rough .
not like it had been <UNK> .

first they got rid of the lunch counter .
then they expanded the supplement area .
but it has to be somewhat competitive .
you have to order it .
"not spicy , but actually hot , temperature wise ."
you ' ll have a lot to pick from .
it ' s trying to be upscale .
this will not be that place .
i took my best buddy here for breakfast today .

exceptional food and execution .

my wife and i love this store .
the food was actually much better than i expected .
this did the trick .
cashiers are usually nice in my experience .

they only had sapporo on tap .
unfortunately i went without a brew during my visit .
overall i ' m digging this place .
the staff is friendly and precise .
the tortillas are fantastic .
chips were excellent but the salsas were average .
getting one of their beers is the problem .
"wings , beer , fun ."
i guess looks really are deceiving sometimes .
the three salsas that were served tasted pretty bland .
"i recommend their appetizers and beer highly , though ."
i ' d maybe come back for the meat .
visits are always quick and <UNK> .
stop by late afternoon for the smoothest visit !
"it was well done ... dead , grey meat ."
my wife got the southwest burger .
this one is generally a mixed bag .
how cool is that ?
the pizza was beyond massive .
my wife and my sister-in-law barely ate one slice .
<UNK> strikes an awesome balance of thickness and toppings .
"the crust is deep , but not too thick ."
but that was the thing that impressed me least .
"the parking lot is tight , and often full ."
painting is actually kinda tough to get right .
i just do n't see the value here .
my wife tried a carnitas torta .
that ' s not a big deal though .
maybe you want to <UNK> your own sausage .
. even your license .
seems really decent though .
what are you supposed to do ?
. all finds at lv <UNK> .
do n't let us have all the fun though .
"<UNK> are pretty dependable , and easy to locate ."
my only gripe with this is the price .
think of them like high-end ballpark nachos .
i recommend ordering the steak to top it off .
give it a chance !
good creative southern dishes .
"a bit annoying , but not the biggest deal ."
i ' m not kidding .
unless everywhere else is full .
good staff that is welcoming .
my family took a day trip to death valley .

- how did <UNK> old guy get in ?
the free drinks they give out are watered down .
the tickets get you a well mixed drink .
no wonder why they changed their name .
plenty of space with a fold out sofa .
excellent deal on the suite via email from mgm .
check in line was at least 00 minutes long .
honest good people here .
this location however refuses to seat us .

updating my review here .

the food was very very good .
the tom kha is really delicious .
no smoke smell and it felt like a diner .
this is the spot .
"0st off the mac & cheese daddy , perfect ."
"really flavorful , non greasy chili ."
but octane is a must .
i do not recommend this liquor shack to anyone .
its a gimmick and it stinks .
the monkey dessert was the best in my opinion .
the place is packed .
what gives this place 0 stars is the service .
the staff was awesome .
selected suburban elite based on the yelp reviews .
i received a confirmation text after hanging up .
this is my favorite restaurant in the world .
she thought she married a man .
this seems like a horribly <UNK> pizza hut .
best to avoid this location .
great place for taco tuesday ' s !
you get the rooms nobody wants .
this was another place that had a great breakfast .
this was a pleasant surprise .
because the prime rib was so good .
there is a parking structure in back .
"it is a brewery , got you some beers ."
0 stars for this guy .
very good county breakfast .
"everything was very good , service was awesome ."
and the place was very clean .
all the food was made very well and tasty .
and they have a few of them .
"so $ 00 was for what now , bs ."
this place has some good tortillas for the tacos !
"the service was prompt , and friendly ."
and the food is somewhat healthy .
i placed an order for the <UNK> sandwich .
i heard some italian language being thrown around .
i ca n't recommend this place enough .
that ' s insane and impressive .
good nonetheless and acceptable .
potato soup was great .
i ' m breaking the rules on this one .
not recommended at all .
finally settled with something simple .
sat down and started on my meal .
pretty good especially dipped in the cocktail sauce .
"lastly , had the catfish which was good ."
"tv is on , college basketball ."
"0 minutes later , beer and burger arrives ."
was there any seasoning done to the meat ?
ordered a couple tamales and some black frijoles .
food is super cheap .
greasy which i enjoy .
00 minutes last time .
there was no originality .
order came out quickly enough .
the presentation of the food was extremely uninspiring .
gnocchi look liked campbell ' s soup .
that ' s my best description .
she found it sour .
i ' m not going to recommend skinny italian .
always filling and cheap .
great quality for the price .
very nice old school style decoration .
"i repeat , non koreans , avoid this one ."
how can you mess up sushi this bad ?
going here will give you the experience .
how is this place still running ?
"for the phoenix , <UNK> rd location ."
"otherwise , i highly recommend this place ."
"first , the good : the staff was helpful ."
0 - rrb - this was particularly bad .
it was pretty rough there .
"great shop , all-around ."
i really ca n't recommend these folks enough .
only then could you possibly justify the prices !
overall they had some good options .
the ribs looked good too .
this is a must go to .
i ordered the cajun combination and it was awesome .
i had the 00 hour ribs .
plus a wide array of beer to choose from .
"we ordered takeout , and were quoted 00 minutes ."
great food and service .
the service was poor as well .
i would recommend this place to anyone .
the first is one of diversity .
but the bigger issue was the comedy .
"way , way to much of it ."
look at many of the reviews here .
the show is n't bad .
it ' s just missing out on its potential .
"now , let us talk about the meats ."
this place was a nice restaurant .
"next , the food was more than i expected ."
we started off with the foie gras .
it was seared and served with toast and jam .
"excellent sandwiches , empanadas , and teas ."
the pool is not heated .
my girlfriend has no problem paying the fees .
the district property itself is decent .
the food is excellent .
very cool modern vibe here .
poor customer service and same poor results .
this mcdonald ' s is always dirty .
local beers as well as national brands on draught .
take a selfie against the charlotte skyline .
"just outside 000 , perfectly accessible from anywhere ."
why bother reviewing the cowfish ?
"well , my 0 stars are for the food ."
the fries were impressive .
"ultimately , the food is solid ."
the frozen section is in great shape .
cons : produce can be a bit iffy .
some of the packaged produce is in better shape .
anyone will tell you this .
the salads are also top notch .
and everything possible is nc sourced .
i hear some of the <UNK> varieties are delectable .
it ' s by far the best .
or tomorrow at the very latest .
"no sharing of this one , guys ."
two characteristics i always look for in a burger .
appreciate the imported beers ... for a decent price .
everything is really raw and creatively constructed .
"recently , i indulged in the chia breakfast bowl ."
but full in a very pleasant way .
winner all the way around .
great value as well .
"* staff is friendly , if a little disorganized ."
i was blown away .
"shop local when you can , folks ."
and this store is a great place to start .
"outdoor apparel , gear and shoes ."
these guys get it right .
do n't be that guy .
the one obvious drawback is the lack of <UNK> .
' ' and that ' s a fair question .
and i bought a t-shirt .
but they did in a pinch .
"simplicity wins the day here , folks ."
i tried the sauce and was impressed .
' ' a cuban dish to die for .
"please , do n't thank me ."
just enjoy a true south charlotte gem .
"pricing is pretty simple , too ."
"service is speedy , and friendly enough ."
nothing over the top .
' ' makes my head spin with happiness .
go to mr . k ' s .
a favorite of mine is the paper dosa .
lots of chickpea dishes with splendid seasonings .
"chana masala , check ."
"probably going to be awesome , too ."
"for me , that ' s <UNK> ."
at least i was .
he always looks <UNK> after a fresh cut .
i simply must write a review .
one word : pregame .
<UNK> is there for a reason .
so get your craft beer and suck it up .
* * staff : stellar .
and a vip only bar .
please and thank you .
what can i recommend ?
"ah , i guess you get the picture ."
nothing too special about the comedy zone .
"quirky , hilarious guys , all with <UNK> ."
but it will do in a pinch !
"overall , it ' s just not my beat ."
it was sunday morning and i was hungry .
here ' s what happened .
the mr enjoyed what he ordered as well .
and the chips were boring .
the tempura batter failed on every level .
they ' ve done neither .
we were hungry and needed lunch .
there are much better options at the met .
a familiar old friend .
<UNK> ' fries with veggie chili .
"nature boy , ding dong style ."
"tall , cool , cheap cans of pbr ."
quick indian lunch at a reasonable price ?
i eat a lot of veggie burgers .
i devoured every morsel happily .
"pizza is super thin crust , but not <UNK> ."
and they do a great job of brewing beer .
but heist is not just a bar .
that ' s a miracle for me .
they really make the experience worthwhile .
please and thank you .
they put the other guys to shame .
staff are also quite friendly and helpful .
but the final product is worth it .
and usually some sort of relatively inexpensive wine .
service is top notch .
lots of craft offerings .
- the pasta dishes are really solid .
what a great dive .
it did n't become one on accident .
props for the local selections .
i can stand behind a place like this .
"which is , by all accounts , ridiculously long ."
just what it sounds like .
apparently their chili is a big deal .
you ' ll leave happy .
the garlic knots are also winners .
apparently they ' re known for their hot dogs .
a true charlotte staple .
"no italian seasonings , no char , nothing remarkable ."
` ` it looks like meat ... not meat .
"yes , the parking lot is atrocious ."
"yes , they close early ."
they put most other cheese grits to shame .
"overall , a solid choice ."
"thanks , hawthorne ' s ."
and generally under the name of someone you know .
pretty much all the employees are overtly affable .
not many places are still like that .
my side of pasta salad was happily mediocre .
service is also over-the-top friendly and helpful .
this place is nothing but trouble for me .
"there were some down sides , too ."
it was filling but none too impressive .
i ca n't help it .
i love cast iron waffles .
"the recipe has , thankfully , stayed the same ."
"enjoy the great outdoors , friends ."
or at least this little pocket of it .
hair looks great now .
"fresh , strong made coffee was used ."
our appetizer was satay sticks .
could have been an off night .
the chipotle ribs small plate was amazing .

the gym was good .
i had a patty melt that was fantastic .
the waitress was very good .
- rrb - is worth it for lunch .
it was a great atmosphere for shopping .
this place is definitely worth all of the buzz .
when the panthers are having a good season .
"and if the irish are playing , look out ."
just your typical small town post office .
the place is separated into 0 different rooms .
they blew me away as well .
but this is the complete opposite of that .
what do these people do for a living ?
"think diner , with lots of variety ."
they downgraded me to a basic room .
* * * update to the response i got .
obviously this room is n't clean either .
half and half was great .
you get protein pancakes and choice of skillet .
both pancakes and skillet were great .
on to the food .

found this place on yelp .
i found it was very polite and good value .
i got a wash and wax for $ 00 .
found this place on yelp .
i found it was very polite and good value .
i got a wash and wax for $ 00 .
great place to stop after work .

my wife and i really like this place .
returns and exchanges have always been easy and quick .
you ca n't go wrong .
my wife prefers their crepes .

"wonderfully warm , low light atmosphere ."
i like this place .
the service was attentive .
everything appears to be freshly prepared using real ingredients .
"the wait staff are friendly , knowledgable and approachable ."
this place is jaw dropping .
it ' s quite simply astonishing and highly inviting .
the pasta was prepared perfectly .
- maybe no . 0 - rrb - .
my only other gripe concerned our check in status .
love the dark coolness of houston ' s .
lots of dark wood and subdued lighting .
getting to and from cf is usually pretty easy .
it looks like the timeshare property it has become .
this property is old and tired .
<UNK> ' s also has restaurants in lake <UNK> .
it ' s good but not that good .
but this location gets the job done .
i give macy ' s overall 0 stars .

two brothers rated well so we tried it .
great atmosphere with friendly waiters .
great place for lunch or dinner .
our family really likes this particularly location .
service was pretty quick .
"great steaks , chops and rotisserie chicken ."
what ' s not to like ?
it ' s more like a 0.0 at best .

a cultural gem in the desert .
martin guitars has a similar video at its exhibit .
the other drawback is its size .
everything at this resort is top drawer .
our cocktails were done very well .
service was very good and attentive .
this place is ridiculously inefficient .
"do yourself a favor , find some other provider ."
then came the italian picnic salad with chicken .

little gem of a restaurant in an unlikely site .

i will be back really funny and interesting store .
the food is amazing you must try the <UNK> .
by far the best paradise in phoenix !

i was amazed at how good the food was .
quality of the fish was excellent .
this was the closer of the night / morning .
the food is surprisingly very good !
the omelets were great too .
the lasagna is also very good .
just a minor complaint .
i love southwest airlines .
so no tvs is ok .
it ' s like a tradition now .
they do it up in a <UNK> fired oven .
very good pie on a crispy thin crust .
the italian sandwich my wife had was nice .
bread was hardly better than subway .
writing this for my wife .
we had breakfast here too .
the jambalaya was great but a little too spicy .
great selection of craft beers .

ok bar to drink at .
it is n't cheap .
"do n't go here , eat frozen pizza instead ."
thin crust pizza here is good .

i ' m still waiting for that phone call .
it ' s worth the visit .

it ' s like a <UNK> on steroids .
"if you know this going in , it helps ."
every one of the locations offers the same thing .

service was below average .
very deceiving practices and a major disappointment .

the asian section was n't good .
very awful service and drinks .
dumplings to die for .
. a couple spots of cheese .
one of the better <UNK> i ' ve visited .
seems to me that technology should <UNK> that issue .
being hispanic this is a disgrace .
not sure what could be done about it .
enjoy the area and pick up after yourselves .
not sure where to start with this place .
that is all this place is to me .
a fenced in plot of land .
it is run by dog owners .
"the people were good , dogs were good ."
my favorite dog park in the valley .

they say this is going to change .
"some highlights , food-wise : * toasted jalapeno raviolis ."
"first , the good news ."
the food was tasty .
every other part of the meal was a disaster .
the dolphins make it worth the price of admission .

$ 0 for a very flavorful belgian beer .
mgm is a great casino and hotel .
went there only three weeks opened .
excellence at it ' s best .

this is way more than a shabu shabu place .
helpful hint : visit the sauce bar first .
"service , value , and cleanliness deserve 0 stars ."
bath slightly dated as well as property exterior .
simple establishment with nice fresh food .
i should have followed my instincts .
are these planes even safe to fly ?
the best pilots chase the best wages .
pace yourself as the selections are plentiful .
the ramen chef took intense pride in his work .
odd location in retail plaza for the price point .
fitness room tiny but satisfactory .

"ok , lets start with the obvious ."
"food was typical showmars fare , everything tasted good ."
"was pretty crowded , waited about 0 min ."

"grass fed beef , organic chickens ."
very solid basic dishes .
they were then closed for a few days .

most of the staff looks like lost puppy dogs .
"again , not my fault ."
and apologized for our waitress .

seems it all boils down to poor management .
thanks pinky ' s ! ! wow .
no really ... wow .
wife had an enchilada and tostada .
had <UNK> this week for a work function .
the bartenders were always the best .
"mostly under seasoned , and unimaginative ."
ca n't remember the exact name right now .
also with dish that held 0 different dipping sauces .
"as other reviews have noted , definitely family owned ."
just a blank unfriendly stare .
"very , very , dry falafel ."
should have just gone to <UNK> .
this is the only place i would ever return .
the positive for this visit stops there .
"the bacon was way , way , overcooked ."
` ` hashbrowns ' ' were raw .
"no thanks , i wo n't be back ."
yes i know its terrible for me .
and that is pretty damn rare for fast food .
other than that typical bk fare .

the tinga was packed with flavor .
victoria beer rounded everything off .
"second , tried craigslist ."
other stuff for cheap !
much better grub than <UNK> .
"er , ` ` action figures ."
"work your magic , ray !"
it ' s a bar in a supermarket complex .
no problem with that .
a supermarket bar with a <UNK> policy ?
a hot dog combo is still $ 0.00 .
my return to phx went well also .
great setup as a resort
average at best ` ` italian ' ' food .
prices are cheaper than the competition .
the seats are not good .

"same with shake shack , i get regular cheeseburgers ."
tastes kinda like big mac sauce only better .
free buffet for breakfast came with my room booking .
the service was very good - friendly and attentive .
lots of different seafood offerings as well .
this place is horrible .
unhappy employees and poor management .
"nothing special , but it ' s good enough ."
the sushi here is pretty mediocre .
"and avoid the dim sum , its a disappointment ."
they have a wide selection of meats .
truly worth every dime .
casino floor lacks cocktail servers .

bacon wrapped around a hot pepper !
"killer food guys , killer ."
appetizers are n't bad in general .
the arroz <UNK> <UNK> was a great dish !
"all in all , its not a terrible shop ."
just a little inconsistent and <UNK> for current issues .
about 00 miles away from this shop .
that is a business owner right there .
most people complain about the price .
this is certainly a hidden gem .
this is a great place to be .
in other words ; this place is busy .
plan ahead and get here early .
what a great shop .
all current running series ' are <UNK> .
i absolutely love greg ' s comics .
greg ' s is the place to be .
every wednesday i look forward to visiting the shop .
they used fresh ingredients .
"overall , will come back for sure ."
the service is pretty good but not extraordinary .
the food is satisfying but not great .
the price is fair .
"in fact , i budget extensively ."
papa murphy ' s is the answer .
there is n't much to discuss .
"you ' re there maybe five , ten minutes ."
but the pizzas are big .
quality here ' s where pm shines .
something you wont get frozen .
my wife and i shared the garlic fries .
my wife and i shared the garlic fries .
i expected the price to be a bit high .
this place was delicious .
the beans were not dry like some other places .
"fried mushrooms , crunchy and not over breaded ."
my gripe was the steak special .
this was place was delicious .
i ordered the philly cheesesteak with fried mushrooms .
the cheesesteak was pretty damn tasty .
the mushrooms were also good .
average is the best description .
overall most dishes were average .
their food is simply the best .
nice people behind counter .
deserts were very disappointing .

price is n't bad and decent value .
best restaurant in arizona for asian food .
honest ; professional ; and get the job done .

all salads tasted pretty good .
simply the best frozen yogurt in arizona .
what else can you say ?
staff was friendly but the sandwhich was just horrible .
the food is outstanding .
<UNK> has n't changed in years .
"and , the place is very clean ."
the oysters were not fresh .
all the meats were over cooked .
no need to make a special trip .
"no , the rooms are not rundown or <UNK> ."
the kobe beef there is freaking perfect .
these things are amazing .
their menu is simple and their sandwiches are great .
so it ' s good stuff for sure .
but the average is probably 00 .
* location * the location is excellent .
"for the location , the price is excellent ."
right next to venetian - lrb - poker !
the rooms are really comfortable and clean .
the pool is nothing special .
casino - no this is n't aria .
and $ 0 jameson / coke ?
quite a ways from the downtown vegas strip .
probably would stay again if the price comes down .
service has always been great .
ham steak and eggs was a good choice .
service was very good and very fast .
the best food in las vegas hands down .
also kegs and kegs of beer on tap ... .
why waste your time anywhere else .
the service here is downright horrible .
the drinks themselves were also bad .
the food itself is also absolutely atrocious .
overall this place is pretty bad .
"the service was okay , nice and friendly staff ."
service is pretty quick .
"their <UNK> were great , especially the fries ."
"however , other dishes were mediocre at best ."
there is nothing special about the place .
the food is mediocre at best .
i had the pho dac biet and was tasty .
the cafe <UNK> <UNK> da was well prepared .
i think jersey mikes is better by far .
found myself talking to someone but not really ordering .
subs did not blow me away with flavor .
but good food and good people are always here .
the burgers where good .
other than that everything was good .
the price was very good for scottsdale .
even there appetizers where well price with large portions .
first time there was great .
it was great food .
customer care is just as bad .
save your money and time and go somewhere else .
do n't be a victim like me .
fast and pleasant transaction .
"so , here is why it is bad ."
how do you mess up beef fried rice ?
i can make it with more flavor .
my steak was good though .
"the asparagus was as bad , no flavor whatsoever ."
"great food , great service ."
quality is always top notch .
a very pleasant surprise .
we sat down and ordered drinks .
the hibachi though is great .
my wife even said she would try it .
everything is very relaxed at <UNK> .
the management is a wholly different matter .
the food in the bag is always wrong .
"go , it ' s good food and fun ."
it seems there is either new management or ownership .
my second phone was also defective .
this massive themed hotel was pretty disappointing .
"glitz , bright lights and no substance ."
"like las vegas in general , overpriced ."
fame seems to be having an identity crisis .
it does n't know what it wants to be .
- rrb - it was run .
the food and service were definitely good .
as always the food was <UNK> titled .
it would n't be my recommendation .
i am a big beatles fan .
soon after the show bursts to life .
i wo n't ruin it for you .
you should go see it .
my ear drums almost burst standing that close .
went here late at night for some food .
it was a good time .
<UNK> is a bad name .
i ' ll say that right now .
next was the dolphin habitat .
"very informal , but still impressive ."
girlfriend ' s parents got their vows renewed here .
i guess that ' s not a complaint .
<UNK> style <UNK> rounds with few rules .
i am now a believer .
"the decor is nice , and clearly vintage ."
we had a good time listening to the band .
its strong but without any acidity .
just smooth good tasting coffee .
the burrito was amazing !
the staff is really nice and dont hover .
from start to finish was exemplary .
our last dish was a truffle barley pasta .
pros : three nice guys .
inexpensive for las vegas .
located in a dungeon .
"nothing really wrong , but nothing particularly special ."
would i recommend it ?
the location looks like a dungeon .
like the trailer park of hotels .
pros : good location .
. upgrade to a suite .
what ' s the difference ?
a regular room is 000 square feet .
ever try fish dipped in ashes ?
each place more special than the last .
pros : good portions and value .
not far from the strip .
"if you want fancy , look elsewhere ."
no surprise according to plenty of reviewers .
nora ' s passed the smell test .
nobody at the table voiced any <UNK> .
"good size , texture and tomato taste ."
the side order of spaghetti was also respectable .
... running the restaurant and having fun doing it .
you almost felt like a regular after one visit .
<UNK> was my choice of burger .
one size sandwich stopped here twice for <UNK> meals .
"both times i went , there were none left ."
we tried the famous traditional rao ' s meatballs .
the kitchen is laced with stainless steel appliances .
she was the bomb .
"this time around , it was not the case ."
my palette detected no <UNK> of it .
location 0rd floor next to the sushi joint .
skip the lines and call it in ahead .
order a pizza pie or 0 or 0 .
the pepperoni & sausage is a killer <UNK> combo .
but i have a few bones to pick .
what a crock of * * * .
let me say the service was top-notch .
appetizer : ahi tuna & salmon tartare : superb .
some say the meat tastes better on the bone .
more meat and has a nice crispy outside texture .
hard to mess that up .
wait staff are great !
$ 000 for party of 0 .
bring your own wine and no corking charge .
came here for a solo dinner while on business .
the food is pretty authentic french .
"multiple rooms , with <UNK> here and there ."
the whole place is just class .
"great bruschetta , best i ' ve ever had ."
the best deal is the sushi deluxe meal .
the ambience and service were incredible .
"service was good , and quick ."
no issues with that .
and there also can be a communication barrier .
not a big deal .
i can go there just for that .
i would recommend this pei wei .
<UNK> kfc you sell chicken right ?
this is the spot if you like crab !
"service is simple , it ' s a buffet ."
i went with about 0 others .
good stuff with a nice price !
they also have beer tasting on wednesdays .
so i sat down .
seems like that was all the other people ordered .
"i will be back , with my military id !"
the beans ... well they could have kept that .
they already knew what the deal is !
that ' s pretty good service .
not sure if this is there fault or not .
so it did n't sound right ?
well that was still a 00 min .
i would n't recommend this to anyone .
we asked the guy that gives samples of beer .
cause i would always be in there .
the waitress are really cool !
and the least expensive bottles were $ 000.00 !
at that point there was 0 of us .
all i went there for was an oil change .
"wtf , what the heck does he think ?"
well of course i said .
they open about 00:00 .
it will take about 00 min .
what the hell can you do !
this place is so freaking expensive .
i decided to go with the mango margarita .
i order the combo plate .
and i will be back .
i always find great deals at kohl ' s .
"go across the street , <UNK> !"
but i ' m not into video games .
only because i knew what i was going for .
she offered us a free drink or a <UNK> .
nice small local casino .
went there to check out there beer .
i think the steaks take a little longer !
... no live band ?
"when i need help , i will find you ."
but i like my own dressing ... there ranch .
do n't ask me the name of it .
most of the vendors were laid back .
"i just left , and he stayed there ."
i make better fried rice at home .
i look around and see people eating lau lau !
i ordered a combo with a desert .
"everything you ad extra , is an extra charge ."
that ' s what i went for .
so i ended up getting the shredded beef enchiladas .
"ok , lets get this party started !"
i was thinking this place must be good .
do i have to give it a star ?
"kudos for opening a business , and creating jobs ."
the regular tacos are good .
a basket of fries they were seasoned just right .
i love there condiment bar .
i see us coming here in the future .
"the bartender introduced herself , and shook our hands !"
we started talking about the beers they had .
but this was a nice change of pace .
"corn on the cob , baked beans ."
for the most part i liked it .
"to hear some down home , southern soul blues !"
but alot people knew it was there .
got there before anyone else .
so i go and ask for help .
"ohhh yea , football !"
00:00 pm to 0:00 am $ 0.00 house wine .
seems like the crowd was over 00 .
this is a nice spot to go to .
away from the strip .
the chicken strips and tavern tots were really good .
but we really want a corvette !
over priced for a combo .
but later the smoke hit ' s ya !
unless someone else is paying for it .
you needed 0 hands to keep it steady .
make sure you get a pack of syrup .
"ok , say welcome to anna ' s !"
i need a cal king .
no ... i want one that says cal king !
it might cover the top but not the sides !
out bartender was cool .
they have guns you can rent as well .
and the lady would n't budge .
but you have to check it out for yourself .
"but hey , it is what it is !"
this is a very interesting place .
we like double <UNK> and lagers .
we asked her for a beer .
there beers are awsome .
the burgers ... there ok .
"got the chicken parmesan , it was awsome !"
service is always awsome !
i ' m far from a buffet person .
"people , do n't move out of your way !"
you pick what you want .
again off the chain .
there prices are alot lower than other places .
wow ... now that was awesome !
the mall was n't as crowed as i expected .
lol i love the italian subs !
i just did n't know where to began .
but back to my meal .
but i did fill up on the salad .
it ' s been almost 0 hr .
they ran out of short ribs !
see how family treats your business !
it was off the chain .
this was his first visit to claim jumper .
plenty of sales people to assist you !
i like the steak nacho ' s better .
lol we just went for a couple of drinks .
it ' s a nice change of pace .
and found this place .
i go in to check it out .
there needs to be a minus button !
this review will get edited with more details !
but this place is awsome !
- lrb - what beer is it ?
0 cans for . 00 cents .
the pastrami was ok !
nothing big in the electronics yet !
she served us up .
as we were looking at the prices .
and then $ 0.00 per additional topping after that .
were talking $ 00.00 for a 0 topping pizza .
just here to buy some hollow point bullets !
i have no idea what it is .
the skinny fries were good though .
yep ... ding ding ding !
then i order the mac n <UNK> .
it also came with some really good cornbread pancake .
it was n't even 0 min .
i very seldom eat it .
fast and professional service for an oil change .
they have some amazing beer at this spot .
"just lettuce , tomatoes , mayo and mustard packets !"
although i guess there <UNK> construction .
some are laying down .
it ' s a very interesting place !
and they serve a couple of beers on tap !
i also got the banana nut .
he <UNK> about how good it is .
there menu is very simple .
they also have a nice beer menu .
they will point you in the direction .
no beer on tap yet .
he pays attention to detail .
great place to take your guest !
it ' s a pool supply store .
or you get what they have .
they have like 0000 beers on tap !
we ended up buying one somewhere else .
<UNK> my this little place is awesome !
the writing is so small .
not that hard right ?
"it had alot of flavor , tasted old fashioned ."
"ghetto , ghetto , ghetto wow wal-mart !"
i thought i was a clam chowder gail !
ok : what happened ?
i ' m guessing val threw in the towel .
i still go at least once a year .
"it gets its 0 stars , period ."
note this was in the late morning .
very ` hardcore ' asian food super market .
the veal was excellent .
"breaded ever so lightly , fried gently ."
great food and at an affordable price .
the dining room is behind the bar .
a nice place to have a meal .
there were maybe 0 tables and 0 were full .
service was friendly but ungodly long .
it was prepared in a red sauce .
"the pasta was soft , far from al dente ."
i think its a deadly mistake .
affable young <UNK> for sure .
that is not a confidence inspiring action .
it is a mess .
i had the pulled pork sandwich with baked beans .
"the pork was fine , the beans delicious ."
people eating in here are huge .
well ... go figure .
pizza is not the best but the staff is .
"really nice guys , fast moving and generous ."
i stop mostly for slices on the way home .
the sauce is tasty .
place is a joke .
got ta give props where props is due .
does not get much better then this .
small gripe but the devil is in the details .
food was ok not good .
pastries need some work .
everything fresh unlike the <UNK> experience .
bad - where do i start .
price is 00 for 0 .
waited along time to try this place out .
place was packed at 000pm at night .
overall worth a trip from the strip .
"beer cold , lemonade good , very inexpensive ."
"wine was overpriced , steak was dry and flavorless ."
just learned there is now a restaurant location .
this place had decent food .
i said fine please call the police .
bottom line up front : 0 .
the owner is a disgusting human being .
filthy place with low standards go somewhere else yelpers !
imperial palace was great !
jack on the rocks - lrb - ps .
i recommend this place .
"they make quality , great tasting food consistently ."
the shining star of this hotel is the service .
moving on to the review of the hotel .
saw good reviews saying it was a 0 star .
"the products they use , keep the water sanitized ."
which was equal to luke warm bath tub water .
very courteous and professional .
it needs a <UNK> up .
always a staple in madison .
great little breakfast place .
jane ai n't lazy in the kitchen .
best steak i ever had .
the absolute worst meal in vegas this trip .
the waitress arrives and i order the special .
my med rare prime rib was well done .

each were extremely tasty .
"and then of course , thank god for yelp !"
"then my waiter , <UNK> was top drawer !"
the turkey bacon and the pork sausage was delicious .

our initial non smoking room smelled of smoke .
sinks and tubs way out dated & rusty parts .
stay in the sky suites for an unforgettable experience .

try the blue cheese dressing .
i had the lumberjack sandwich .
it was real greasy .
not as dark and shady as the previous restaurant .
and this includes park rd ' s movie theater .
do n't go within 00 minutes of closing .
this location is consistent with bad service .
why even have online ordering when its not convenient ?
nobody could break away to give me fries .
try a touch of professionalism on the phone .
look at the reviews of this place .

the carnitas and cabeza are definitely my favorite .

shut it down and build a parking lot .
"this place is crowded , noisy , no atmosphere ."
the complimentary bread was a bit disappointing .
. perfect way to end the meal .
for entree we shared the sixteen spice chicken .
. avoid it if you can .
"there was scallop , hamachi and snapper ."
"moreover , the chicken itself was bland and unseasoned ."

the rooms where nice .
so i had to fork up 00 bucks .
beautiful rooms and a great staff .

super low quality meat .
would definately return and have a couple pints .

the service was great .
the price was fair .
"rose henderson , said they saw no <UNK> complaint ."
soda dispensers needed more through cleaning .

owners are total <UNK> .
these guys charge nearly three times that amount .
a total rip off .
i would never trust these crooks !
good store old mgr retired .

only one sushi chef .
i agree with one of the previous reviews .
that ' s my truck .
nice dim sum restaurant .
"the coffee was warm , not hot ."
the management leave a ton to be desired .
overall the staff was young and unprofessional .
yelp always leads me to interesting place .
what a fun and delicious place .
i ' m glad i tracked this place down .
i ' ll be back whenever i hit vegas .
this club is insane .
the gps location is a bit off .
"try peppercorn ranch , so good ."
steak hoagie is filling .
i do those this place already .
the mechanics are certainly the best .
i never felt rushed or any pressure .
that is very rare .
my wife and i thoroughly enjoyed the production .
"and the bartender was really cool , too ."
look into the root cause of the issue .
this incident set me back 0 business days .
been here at least 00 times and always consistent .
staff did not seem to care .
"good bar food , reasonably prices drinks ."
food and drinks arrived quickly and were good .
once inside it was as expected from most theaters .

the kimchi and daikon were both excellent .
and the idea of grilled naked wings is fantastic .
the pasta was drizzled with scampi sauce .
"all were great , as well as the margaritas ."

the buffet of buffets .
fairly epic looking on the poster .
very friendly waiters with the drinks .

immediately it had a nice ambiance .
the food was quite good .
had prime rib there which was also good .
as well as some seafood .
chocolate fondue was pretty good .
would maybe check that out another time .
dining staff were all very polite and helpful .
this is not a strip club .
drove there last weekend .
overall it was a good deal .
i made a lot of mistakes in vegas .
it ' s probably better when it is hot .
the loco moco was kind of bland .
the teriyaki beef was better .
great traditional american food .
excellent service provided by tanya and the entire staff .
beware of this tourist trap .
friendly service and a professional staff .

i show up very early or take a cab .
"simply put , my favorite lunch destination in arizona ."
the big apple - rrb - .
nice spot for a date .
the wait staff is helpful and courteous .
the portions are enormous .
my buddy will be eating pasta for a week .
most dishes were $ 00-00 .
the interior is very nice .
"the food is very good , but not exceptional ."
the <UNK> part is that it is fun .
the movies are <UNK> .
the selection is good .
fitness cafe is a unique place with great food .

the crowd is older and generally very affluent .
"serves expresso , beer , and wine ."
the wait staff is exceptional .
do n't let the <UNK> fool you .
the menu offers a diverse selection of american fare .
food is typical irish fare .
all in all : very solid .
prices range from $ 0-00 .
seating is sometimes tight .
good people there and good food !
it was a good change of pace .
i take it back the dip was pretty good .
<UNK> is an awesome guy .
he was very professional and detail oriented .
then the high pressure guy came in .
that just put me off and i left .
i know stuff happens so im reasonable .
ok not the end of the world .
these people have their heads up their ass .
avoid this place at all costs .
great value for the price .
each one is fresh and cooked to order .
great <UNK> ' s and green chili tostadas .
breakfast was delicious and again blew away expectations .
long wait for a very disappointing experience .
seems to be a very popular and busy place .
the beer is out of this country good .
the service is ok for a new place .
but that is n't the case .
"the dinner is great , but the lunches suck ."
what happened to that great roast beef sandwich ?
have these people ever been to nyc ?
"you trim the fat , all of it ."
been here twice now .
the beef was overcooked and not tender .
need more wing specials too .
this place is dope .
surprised by all the low ratings ... hmm .
i ' ve never had a bad sandwich here .
the food finally arrived and it was lackluster .
got the wings here .
"they also have grilled wings , very tasty ."
xx <UNK> balls were awesome .
you could make a restaurant based solely on these !
the pepperoni was amazing .
price : kinda steep for a novelty concept .
very decent for a chinese buffet .
got the poutine which is their signature item .
got the meatball sandwich as well .
this place is odd .
"the crinkle fries suck , no thanks ."
the sauce selection is nice .
"the parm are awesome , very tasty and juicy ."
the batter was on point .
incompetence at its finest here in the service department .
this is just a sales floor .
so $ 000 to $ 0 .
i was very impressed by dr . troy .
"without you , i ' d be in agony ."
"ok del frisco ' s , listen ."
<UNK> ... it went so well with the steak .
but none of that matters .
. and the wife too .
nothing bad but nothing stellar also .
large slices cooked throughout the day .
good value and good food .
i took my fiancee here to celebrate .
"we also had some oysters , obviously ."
"again , very good ."
perfectly cooked and seasoned .
i had a local pale ale with the dinner .
service was great and food was great .
i went here for a business lunch .
maybe as good as bunky ' s .
"all in all , very good food ."
"brunch was much better than lunch , however ."
graze is a standby in my eating out rotation .
wow was i wrong .
"all in all , highly recommended ."
and the pours are affordable .
it was good chili .
beer selection is pretty good too .
stopped in for a couple of drinks .
"i let it go , didnt say a word ."
"but it was cold , most of them ."
lived about 0 minutes from this place .
great food but its kinda pricey .
one of the best burgers i have ever had .
my fav burger is in pittsburgh .
but most def the best burger in phoenix .
i still buy stuff from there .
omg so like this place is bomb .
it ' s like bowling mixed with golf .
not expensive at all when you go with friends .
i ' m a big fan of indian food .
"however , dinning in is pretty nice ."
":d huge portions , great food ."
"anywho , great place to take people to dinner ."
this place is top notch .
the tennis courts are really nice .
i highly recommend this dental practice .
they do medium rare burgers right .
my manager paid for everything .
:d shots all around .
yelpers give this place some lovin .
the food is also pretty good .
beer / cocktail selection was meh .
go karts could also use a little extra <UNK> .
broccoli slaw and kale chicken salad !
never ending lunch quest officially over .
the place has a sort of rustic feel .
lots of wood and dark wood colors .
"cigar friendly , also a plus ."
just a very comfortable and casual sort of place .
00 cakes was amazing .
came here on the recommendation of a friend .
had the lumberjack pancakes l and it was excellent .
friendly staff and tasty food is a killer combo .
always feels good coming here .
chinese restaurants are usually synonymous with bad customer service .
customer service is top notch !
the best chicken burger i have ever eaten !
this place has got them .
my dog was evaluated and accepted for boarding .
the wash was done in 0 minutes .
` ` talk to living social ' ' .
the drunks are always on point .
very cheap and fast way to get a buzz .
well it was well worth it .
now this bacon martini is what it is .
"pabst , <UNK> and others ."
i recommend this bar to anyone with that attitude .
oh man this is the mecca of pinball games .
i recommend this place to all .
reviewing the casino portion not the hotel .
staff laughed at what i said and poured away .
so in other words ft delivered again thank you .
got a beer for less than 00 bucks .
that was even better than the first one .
that is the charm this casino brings .
also you can play keno while eating .
the lazy river is the real gem here .
my dad traded carne asada for <UNK> .
a shower that sprayed everywhere but your body .
another of their bars sells pbr tall boys .
run of the mill bar food .
this shop sells electronics and birds .
the sausage was solid with a nice little kick .
and how did i finish this homage to gluttony ?
it seemed a bit pricey for pancakes .
0 pancakes for 0 bucks .
does not honor national sub day offer .
i miss this place .
they have a calendar .
i also quite like how the kitchen is visible .
"but anyway , on to the food ."
' ' and that it was .
and they really did it right .
those are things i can hardly blame anyway .
"so , awesome right ?"
good food and at a good price .
"at least , so i expected ."
"' ' oh man , i bit my tongue ."
"but again , just a matter of opinion ."
the food and the service were both great .
top notch eatin joint .
i ordered a bratwurst and a standard hot dog .
good eating at jj ' s .
i had the pizza here recently .
stopped in one day for lunch .
this is a good place for lunch .
i went here on a weekday night .
this place is really good .
then i ate there and was reminded .
it is very unlikely i will return .
i had a bacon cheeseburger and it was great .
"this place is great , especially after 00 pm ."
i saw the sign and pulled right in .
i saw someone with a ribeye steak sandwich .
i ' ll be having that next time .
this place is awesome .
the place was pretty good .
the ambiance here is nice .
this place is worth a stop .
the sourdough baguette was also really well done .
the service was absolutely outstanding .
you will not find a more professional limo service .
the good : elvis was awesome .
i even built a fire and sent smoke signals .
"anyway , no response ."
they were all very good and well presented .
there were ample choices .
"for me , sunrise coffee was a great find ."
great value and a great place .
the service is <UNK> and efficient .
as good as any i have had anywhere .
the staff is great .
the hot and sour soup was ok .
i have certainly had better .
it is certainly worth your time to check out .
the garlic bread was the bomb though .
and not a bad price .
not a bad deal for exactly what i needed .
excellent excellent food and a great service .
very bad they can not keep there words .
gallagher ' s is the place for it .
mccarran international is a weird place .
the <UNK> pipe instruments were cool .
they fail on some of the basics .
i ' m not a big sports fan .
"from then on , it was a good experience ."
i just love watching excellence in action .
but it was n't all that good either .
the two combined make for an interesting challenge .
exactly what you ' d expect .
easily one of my favorites .
the flavor and rare cooking with perfect .
the service has been top rate .
the casino has an imax movie <UNK> !
"lastly , the rooms are simple yet modern ."
the service was prompt and courteous .
their queso dip is loaded and delicious .
very cheap oil change compared to other places .
i would come back for anything car related .
my girlfriend loves the general tso ' s chicken .
the online ordering system on their website is impeccable .
bottom line : they care .
this place is wonderful .
had no problems with the staff .
. oh man - what an amazing desert .
subs and bread are bomb .
wings and sauce - awesome .
this is based on philly roll only .
i usually like it here best .
definitely go with <UNK> .
"they ' re affordable , fast , and amazing ."
i used to love pho kim 00 .
you know what else they did ?
"they make ' em big , so be warned ."
charlotte has a real lack of bagel shops .
do n't see the bagel you want ?
the ordering system has recently been greatly improved here .
cinnamon sugar seems to be the favorite .
"i am a fan of their coffees , though ."
flavorful and well-prepared local ingredients shine throughout the menu .
emphasis is placed on <UNK> ingredients .
"unusual and interesting , and oh so tasty ."
"veggie friends , there are many options here ."
rock on owen ' s crew .
i ' m a big fan of this westin .
really no terrible views here .
this order was soon to be forgotten .
points to wine loft for this .
"nothing exciting , nothing new and tempting ."
"all starters or <UNK> , at best ."
can you slum it for greater volume and choice ?
but is there a difference in quality ?
pinkberry chooses quality over quantity .
my issue really centers around the meats .
"yeah , to say the least ."
our complete dinner lasted just over 0 hours .
it makes for great conversation with a small group .
"really , prime time is saturday ."
but the <UNK> surely deserve mention as well .
<UNK> in the creativity and uniqueness department !
the decoration is best described as rustic <UNK> farm .
cuisine is primarily <UNK> with an emphasis on <UNK> .
clearly there are pacing issues here .
the side of <UNK> mustard was right tasty too .
i could have had several .
"seasonal produce is available , as well ."
no doubt they will be popular in the summer .
"this is local , done best ."
the same should be said for their bbq sundae .
dessert - peanut butter pie .
not that the heartier sandwiches play second fiddle here .
the proof of quality here is in the details .
these guys have easily earned their spot up front .
but that ' s not why you come here .
"that is , provided you can find some parking ."
french press and drip views options are both available .
this is not your typical <UNK> machine swill !
you get the scene .
servers are dressed in jeans and white dress shirts .
a rare win-win for all involved .
"when you are on a schedule , this helps ."
the little pieces of baguette were a nice accompaniment .
gettin ' green while gettin ' full ?
"in my opinion , it sure does ."
"luckily for dish , they go hand in hand ."
so what about the beer ?
the interior is modern and cool .
"the problem , however , is in the execution ."
next month they are doing a beer tasting .
ingredients and options are clearly listed .
options abound even if you opt against dairy .
how about a shot of <UNK> ?
"by far , this is the deal ."
"and , you can stack those coupons together ."
you ca n't beat a deal like that .
why not just bring them out to start with ?
not too bad but not too good either .
pf ' s has the flavor .
all were very good .
"foodie friends , this place is worth a checkout ."
espresso drinks were equally crafted with expertise .
want something you do n't see ?
do come prepared to taste some great local things .
well it can be .
does that command a price premium ?
that totally depends on your budget ' s <UNK> .
salads were appropriately sized and priced for side items .
the pizza seemed perfectly priced at about $ 0.00 .
certainly that has a <UNK> in uptown .
chips were properly salted with some exercise of restraint .
the meal arrived swiftly and was fairly good .
sauces have distinct and vibrant flavor .
this brewery is quite dog-friendly too .
"luckily , bistro made a believer out of me ."
you want a <UNK> ?
this bar alone will do well in this city .
all are also highly recommended alternatives .
want a classic not on the menu ?
why not take good to great ?
"that said , the food here is generally good ."
"never had the milkshakes , but they look good ."
- rrb - are also on the first level .
it ' s also the cheapest for shorter stays .
<UNK> do get parking validated in this lot .
saying nothing usually results in a rather mild dish .
i can understand why some reps were grumpy .
that makes for a serious downgrade .
the last insult was the bill .
the skill in the kitchen is exceptional .
the final product tastes as good as it sounds .
this all has a very warehouse feel to it .
"no such luck , routinely ."
try the trim down category .
now that ' s some customer service .
i ' ll save that review for another time .
"yoga has its own nook , as does cycling ."
will you run faster and further ?
"yeah , count this guy as a fan ."
"and oh yeah , free wi-fi !"
"eat pasta , run <UNK> ."
"no worries , they all taste great ."
looking for a reliable but fast haircut ?
then this supercuts is <UNK> its blades for you .
supercuts gets that job done at a fair price .
"training and time should work this out , however ."
both are worth the trip alone .
"viva sabor , a welcome addition to the neighborhood ."
i did not finish mine .
"do not skip appetizers , though ."
"no pickle spears , no wimpy breading ."
many micro draft selections abound too .
"so yeah , there are some issues here ."
a couple glass cases hold cold salads and meats .
a small case behind the register holds desserts .
tables are basic and laminated menus are plentiful .
"cold salads include tabouli , <UNK> and baba ganoush ."
"i ' d have some more , please ."
choose your protein and there are options a plenty .
contrast that with the 00 - minute kimchi .
great add-ons to round out the meal .
clearly a lot went into the up fit here .
"artisan , this is surely not ."
the focus is on <UNK> chicken made in-house .
the same can be said for the fried yucca .
"the <UNK> sandwich is quite nice , for example ."
"empanadas , <UNK> and <UNK> ."
i suppose there are worse problems to have .
if you are coming from uptown .
the inside was small but adequate and quite clean .
luckily the peanut dipping sauce was nice and plentiful .
even the prices seem to be the same .
my personal favorite is the panang curry with pork .
as for the beer - really impressive .
the real draw is the food .
hot but not searing .
the burger easily takes two full hands to manage .
you can also craft a veggie only plate .
"the menu , however , did look more promising ."
"it is , in one word : awesome ."
overall bland and not enjoyable .
flavors were balanced and presentation was well-executed .
"yeah , cowfish was there too ."
"that ' s right , plain as could be ."
down with the artificial intelligence !
the manor is your new home .
also hot dogs and salads available .
this is my go-to car wash .
can you spend a bundle on all of that ?
curried rice in place of mexican rice .
"great for munching , deceptively easy to continue devouring ."
bitters also figure in a number of drinks .
same for the sprouts .
this was upper end dining done right .
"for true <UNK> , i heart yama ."
blind trust is finally rewarded .
pickled vegetables layered in between .
i ' m a fan .
"waist taken in , spot on ."
"jacket pulled in , we do that ."
<UNK> takes a back seat here .
i recently had 0 suits altered within 0 days .
waist <UNK> $ 00 .
wine list is ample and will cover most palates .
parking validation at the table was nice .
big draw for warmer months is the outdoor patio .
the cold beer selection only makes the experience better .
hopefully with time comes a bit more consistency .
everything i have had here is solid good .
"not authentic , but plenty tasty ."
"nothing fancy , nothing unexpected ."
i can see why .
"one other downgrade , the public toilets here reek !"
always a good starter .
what shines here are the sides .
there are some real hidden gems .
my bagel was <UNK> / raisin toasted and buttered .
great bar and food is also very good .
excellent italian food and a huge wine collection .
anytime you ' re in charlotte downtown .
i love mexican and its a hidden treasure .
good place for some kansas city bbq .
the only club car dealers in the area .
small pizza place serving pizza true italian style .
real good selection of <UNK> and tees .
for the price it is a really good wash .
food is very good and fresh .
service was very good and friendly .
great place for italian food .
mellow atmosphere with friendly and knowledgeable staff .
never had a bad meal .
worth a another trip sometime soon .
friendly and knowledgeable staff .
"very affordable , great service , nice clean rooms ."
my favorite restaurant in all of las vegas .
i stayed there with my wife for 0 nights .
the lobby is understated and quiet .
i have been to presentations before .
. and a <UNK> / couch .
the food is also very excellent quality .
. but the food is good .
best cheese steak i ' ve eaten so far .
and add the <UNK> whiz and your set .
i also got the fries which are nicely seasoned .
get it with side of cheese dip .
0 bucks for a standard chili cheese dog .
this place is huge .
"poor service , mediocre food ."
the worst burger joint ever .
ive had better burgers from burger king .
the fries they offer too are very tasty .
their <UNK> and sisig fries are personal favorites .
"but other than that , the place is great !"
kudos on the good work .
this is a very enjoyable show .
then i blacked out .
mostly american with some french items or french influence .
the skin was a bit too crisp imo .
the mussels were also very well done .
i went here for breakfast with a group .
"first off , no seating of incomplete parties ."
take that for whatever it ' s worth .
"so , yes vegas sucks ."
"anyway , this is a decent set of shops ."
but then something funny happened .
food is passable at best .
they are slow but nothing good comes fast .
cooked to order fresh and never frozen .
the food was great the french toast was great .
the hot cakes was great service was good .
i had the ny steak .
the steak was average .
all was good i will come back again .
the local is awesome and the food is great .
the burgers and food in general was good .
food and napkins on the floor .
you have to try the devil ' s mess .
this is the spot for breakfast or brunch .
this is the best pizza in town .
"great bar , and great atmosphere ."
guess i was wrong .
i have been here 0 times .
this place is so-so .
the program was going great for about 0 months .
here ' s the thing .
they charged my almost $ 0 per roll .
good <UNK> to that place .
all of their soups are great too .
this has to be the best pizza in town .
been here a few times .
there are much better places around .
i really like their food and the atmosphere here .
i am normally not carrying cash on me .
would not recommend going to this location .
i started the process in march .
not shasta ' s fault .
saturday i went to presidential pools .
note to <UNK> ' s .
"at the end , the bill came ."
the last $ 00 was tax .
$ 00 in tax !
"do the math , folks !"
charge sales tax on a <UNK> price ?
"good food , good prices ."
what more can i say ?
it was the pizza guy with my order again .
i graciously accepted and thanked him again .
"ate here at lunch , restaurant was half filled ."
great draft beer and cider selection .
the health department needs to do an inspection .
on average probably twice a month .
"but hey , that ' s just me ."
his reply was that he did n't see it .
they do it in-house in their rotisserie oven .
the ribs literally just fell off of the bone .
very reasonable prices for the quality of food .
poor beer selection for a sports bar .
food is just so-so .
worse than your typical bar food .
you can afford to buy 0 of them .
that ' s how you bring in customers .
"great casino , but very noisy rooms ."
ate here the first 0 nights .
what a waste of my money .
i highly recommend this place .
combining the two ... what a novel idea !
this place has a really cool atmosphere .
the service was attentive and fun .
the burgers were great as well .
i ' ll be back .
nice ambiance and friendly wait staff .
these girls were great .
overall though a great place .
good craft beers and good food selection .
slow service but good food .
stopped in to have a drink or two .
this place is unbelievable !
lindsey is an incredible bartender .
"a location for dining , it is not ."
their steak and chicken sandwiches are great as well .
the texture and flavor will have you craving more .
"at first , it was n't all that great ."
"food tasty , but way overpriced ."
i had asked for a king non smoking room .
in all of caesars ?
great prices and very good food with great ambiance .
again us airways you do not fail to disappoint .
but still had 0 <UNK> units .
great food but terrible parking .
these options are not available in los angeles .
this was my 0nd visit to this steakhouse .
the 0st visit was a total disaster .
the food is in general good .
just a decent rare steak .
the 0nd visit i ordered the venison filet .
it came out as a wedge .
rude ones can make it a trial .
tornado could learn a lot from them .

ginger martini was excellent .
this is my first review .
thomas clark and linda <UNK>
not sure what happened to mar l . .
. we did n't really click .
dave is the <UNK> of this .
and the fit and finish is spectacular .
the exterior paint is flawless .
they ruined the finish on my car .
the greeters and sales people are even worse .
all they care about is up selling .
the saving grace was the moo <UNK> .
the tacos were the best ice ever eaten anywhere .
on recommendation i dropped in for dinner .
these were extra large and delicious .
the sushi is a 0 star .
all you can eat for $ 00 .
this is a mixed bag .
every dish was perfectly prepared and beautifully presented .
"food is good , not great ."
healthy place to eat but not traditional greek food .
"still a healthy , fast place to eat ."
the food was surprisingly good .
excellent service - - not rushed .
very competitive with other restaurants in the area .
appetizers were simple and flavorful .
the entrã © es were elegant .
better than expected value .
things taste as good as they look .
these are just a few random examples .
the bacon and sausage was also very tasty .
"simply , this is a great place ."
"avoid at all costs , mentally and financially ."
you ca n't go wrong with the seafood here .
give this place a try .
you wo n't be disappointed .
i want to know what fool made this decision .
they should be <UNK> on the spot .
this is a pretty much american food average place .
just an average joint in my opinion .
the atmosphere is eclectic and inviting .
the one thing lacking was the service .
"overall , a good experience except for the pricing ."
check em out if you are in south end .
this is a great place .
' ' the food was decent enough .
the food is usually lukewarm at best .
the same goes for the food .
overpriced and wayyyy overrated tattoo studio .
take my recommendation and go elsewhere .
this place has zero atmosphere .
"i know , i know , first thought ?"
star trek ! ? what ?
"of course , its got ta be your thing ."
* try the brisket and beans !
that ' s what i did .
this place is out of control .
overall this place is great .
eddie and his helper were great .
old town really needed a good breakfast spot .
fresh squeezed oj was great .
"king crab legs , lobster were absolutely dry ."
$ 000 bucks for 0 wasted .
the rooms are so outdated its awful .
bad service and bad rooms .
no major misses at all .
excellent service as well .
i must say this place was awesome .
this place is absolutely the best on the strip .
"good hummus , and sampler platter ."
it does n't get any better than bloom .
"yes , including a tim <UNK> ' s ."
that sums it up .
three coffees and a water .
the hash browns were room temperature and without flavor .
i eat here at least once a week .
this place was unsatisfying .
the quality of the ice cream ?
the worst of the worst .
let ' s cut to the chase .
"secondly , parts of our crust were burnt ."
"pros : overall , the food is pretty good ."
very good middle eastern food at a cheap price .
the hummus was excellent .
even they need to eat .
that is not a bagel .
those are real bagels - big and meaty .
they ' re also unusually sweet for a bagel .
<UNK> is a bagel .
absolutely the best ! ! ! not from pittsburgh .
was there on vacation with my kids .
even my wife and i were entertained .
wow ! ! ! this place is great .
"again , tried something different - lrb - taro ?"
talk about a greasy spoon dive .
went there for the first time .
staff was very friendly .
i have to admit that the potatoes were excellent .
the architecture was mildly interesting but not awe inspiring .
i only rent with enterprise .
he did exactly what he said .
this is the best roofing company around bar none .
have never experienced german food .
. the pork sausage .
it ' s like comfort food with a <UNK> .
it kinda borders on bland and <UNK> .
the place just looks like that .
that ' s just the head .
the food is incredibly good and surprisingly cheap .
phoenix just got a lot more <UNK> .
what happened to you ?
a <UNK> two stars .
"the crowd , ridiculous cover , and overall space ."
the food is n't that great .
it is what it is .
maybe a combination of all three .
"great location , poor service ."
third : miracle mile dishes out pretty solid portions .
"for me , this place is very satisfactory ."
their selections of beers is also pretty solid .
"well , look no further than au petit four ."
watermelon slushy drinks gave me the runs .
added to that is the pricing of everything .
a <UNK> spot at its most average .
the service was mediocre at best .
there ' s nothing really ny about this place .
my usual tends to be the chicken curry .
it ' s all about atmosphere with this place .
"but with that , some authenticity does arise ."
the lost leaf is one such place .
this place is a genuine surprise .
"sounds like a good time , and it is ."
"at long last , i saw <UNK> <UNK> here ."
what to say about this place ?
what else could you possibly say about the improv ?
that ' s when it happened .
the <UNK> <UNK> collection version .
this had moved from beyond mere lust .
what if they found out ?
0 : the samurai armor and weapons section .
0 : <UNK> too much western art .
japanese fusion restaurant fail .
the range of wines at cheuvront is pretty good .
from that point on i was sold .
too <UNK> end too <UNK> <UNK> da meats .
<UNK> too <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> .
why beat around the bush ?
what were they thinking ?
it gets the job done .
bad thing # 0 : no airport stop ?
why not just build a stop there ?
the lunch crowd arrived shortly after we did .
perks : options for brewing and free wireless internet !
i would recommend parking there when in the area .
the meat was prepared well-done when ordered medium-rare .
went with five people for beers and dinner .
the service was poor .
"good food , good wine , good service ."
don ' s the man !
really chill environment + tasty coffee & pastries ftw !

i logged a complaint with security and the manager .

either way you will be happy .
"writing this made me ono for ono , mmmm ."
thank you tmi for turning my frown upside down .
"postino , you are a blessing to central phx ."
scramble is a refreshing change to counter service .
they have a progressive happy hour starting at 0pm .

"alex , <UNK> and david serve great drinks ."
"happy hour is fantastic , very good deals ."

then soon was the remotes for the gates .
"pretty good variety of ingredients , and tasty ."
"plus , they serve beer ."
"small cozy place , with very friendly staff ."

they ' ll take advantage of you !
0 dishes came to $ 00 dollars .
decent experiences at this property .
perfect for packer or badger games .

the girls upfront always have a smile .
very clean and fresh food .
glad to see a manager take so much pride .

the carne asada was not edible .
"that was the only decent taco , however ."
' ' i explained many of the reasons .
excellent service and the owners where great .
very pleased with <UNK> contractors .
the schtick is they are rude and obnoxious servers .
great food and service .
worth the wait though .
went a weekday morning .
stay away from the apple pie .
the water is filtered and very good .
had to resolve using a manager .
get a receipt if you plan on returning .
traveled to this buffet on very high recommendation .

freddy and the crew are the best .
he offers another crappy side as his comp .
also the food wait time is 00 minutes .

this restaurant used to make good chinese food .
i just stopped in for a buffet dinner .
have to say ... this place is over-rated .
"well , the sandwich was average at best ."
the service was pretty good .
the bad the restaurant was not exceptionally clean .
the restaurant has a strange layout .
the sushi is terrible .
all were really good burgers .
one of the best burgers i ' ve eaten .
the portions are almost too large to be true .
huge portions and authentic flavors .
the special chicken wings are my go to !
please reconsider going to this location .
selling a car that gives good people problems .
the fries alone could bring me back .

kind of feels like dennys in here but cheaper .
i ' ll be back .
food is the bomb !

. events are hosted here throughout the year .
almost all the dishes are under $ 00.00 .

third time back here service was horrible .
looked up great breakfast places in phx .
the belgian waffle with thick cut bacon .
this is the only place i buy pizza now .
what more do you need ?
you ca n't go wrong .
it was cooked perfectly medium and with great flavor .
the entree was the star of the show .
i went with the chicken .
the scallops were huge and very good .
the dessert was a three scoop ice cream dish .
the steak <UNK> entree was ok .
a good portion sirloin with fries .
the taste was beyond average .
the only thing good was the environment and ambiance .
here ' s where things get bad .
just something to know if you freak out easily .
. hence why i ' m not docking points .
it ' s not a cage problem .
it was a flavor grand slam .
inside had nice decor .
it reminded me of a diner .
the service was excellent and the food was fantastic .
these guys are on top of their game .
this place is very good .
the brisket is juicy and flavorful .
i had two beers while i was here .

food is great and the value is spot on .
so does my wife .
i have never had a bad meal here .
i very good fried seafood place .
good beer selection and food that was appetizing .
nothing even imaginative for a beer selection .

i have had better at arby ' s .
"the onions tasted hard and stringy , old ."
what a douche bag .
they lost a customer for good .
i come here everytime i come to vegas .
all conversations seem to be monitored .
cameras are everywhere and there is absolutely no privacy .
they wait on the other asians while ignoring <UNK> .
a heineken beer is overpriced at $ 0.00 .
solid food and solid service make this a favorite .
did n't make it as far as ordering food .

great shop with a great selection of premium juice .
crap would be an over rating .
possibly my favourite restaurant in montreal .
"really really good , but does get expensive ."
"very good pizza , byow ."
"great food , great prices , great service ."
probably the best value for sushi in montreal .
they will not respond to emails .
all they want is your money .
this is a great place for the whole family .
not to mention attitude .
our large group of 00 spent over $ 000 .
took 00 plus minutes for drink orders .
my visit cost $ 00 including <UNK> .
he never did send anything .
these people did not take responsibility .
would be a zero if possible .
fortunate to be seated in the private dining area .
"my advice , go eat anywhere else ."
this is the best nissan dealer in vegas .
the atlantic salmon entree is wonderful .
the sushi is also very good .
"regardless , not <UNK> ' s fault ."
his driving skills were something to see .
lots of direct flights .
this is a swanky <UNK> unique .
avoid this location if you can .
the black and blue 00 burger was pretty good .
servers were very cordial .
this location however is painfully slow .
fried ice cream was terrific .
great place to take the kids .
we had the chicken burrito chimi style .
i ' m being honest here .
f chase this place is horrible .
the phone number does not ring to a business .
great setting for a nondescript outside .
order the hummus if you do n't believe me .
amazing and at a great price .
good pizza and very fast delivery .
always a good dive place to game at .
loose slots and cheap eats .
mid rare with biscuits and gravy .
great food at a great price .
worth the trip from the strip .
the rooms are old and smell like smoke .
recommend you stay away from this property .
worth the trip off the strip for good pizza .
good waffles ; weird sandwiches .
so it ' s not a question of sanitation .
they provide stellar customer service .
"we ' re sorry , chop chop wok ."
you ' re a bunch of truly nice people .
do not miss this place .
pho vietnam grille express deserves it .
jenni pho is now no . 0 .
"believe me now , or pay me later ."
do they not want to make money ?
do n't miss this place .
five guys keeps it simple .
one of the best affordable burgers in vegas .
settebello has a serious contender here .
the <UNK> burgers in town after the <UNK> .
do n't miss this place .
"god , have things changed ."
the gravy was the <UNK> on the dish .

superb food made with care and love .

great good and excellent service for the price .
i recommend the pho tai and goi cuon .

definitely the place to dine and eat anytime .
greatest food place ever .
such an awesome change from everything else in vegas .
o <UNK> pork sausage .
o green dip with chile and mushroom .
this was a surprise .
"and , they take the heat ratings seriously here ."
- rrb - fifteen bucks for a poached egg ?
service at the bar was fast and and entertaining .
i go here at least twice a week .
have you done that ?
i think it might be from a leaking pipe .
the sauce is what got me hooked .
i would recommend them for a casual lunch .
"highly recommended , you wo n't be disappointed ."
it ' s the best beer the dane brews .
all the other beers are good too .
this place is fantastic .
"simply put , the best bagels in the midwest ."
excellent food and prepared as requested .
"service was excellent , and very clean ."
i have lived and traveled all over north america .
their reviews are over rated .
no one visited my table to ensure satisfaction .
thx their reviews are extremely over rated .
"thanks for the recommendations and good service , chelsea !"
please do n't make that mistake .
yes it is pricey but well worth the experience !
this is n't a one time incident .
saying the service is slow is an understatement .
i ' ve been going here for years .
the food was about a 0 out of 00 .
very different than your typical dt madison establishment .
"unfortunately , the bad really outweighs the good ."
"to which we got ` ` k , bye !"
. especially for a $ 000 bill .
these two items are my favorite so far .
"my name is john , i work <UNK> ."
the service has become poor .
this place is closed .
good luck doing business here .
wanted to by 00 used banquet tables today .
this seems to be the way they do business .
under new ownership is not a good thing .
used this store over 00 years with no problem .
it did not get there for four more days .
the newer location rocks .
great food & prices .
have and will continue to recommend them .
he <UNK> me a power cord while i waited .
both times i ordered they included the soup anyway .
the soup is very good .
this is a great gaming store .
the selection of merchandise is great .
there ' s a dedicated card store attached .
i do n't believe they sell individual dice .
the potatoes were great .
everything else was great .
certainly a reasonable value in this area .
best value on the strip .
the fries ca n't be beat .
great selection of sea foods and meats .
roast beef is very good .
especially the fresh made crepes .
the sashimi quality is quite good .
maybe to watch some games on their many tvs .
"very clean , comfortable bar ."
grand canyon roll is a sure bet every time .
thank god i live only minutes from this place .
this place is a <UNK> dive .
mass quantities of <UNK> .
. i ' m only a mile away ?
they all agreed that <UNK> is amazingly authentic .
i will be a regular here .
ordered the <UNK> and twice baked potato .
the twice baked potato was outstanding .
she also thought the steak was a bit bland .
welcome to the hood and good luck !
four stars for the beer and the experience .
bravo bobby flay on an amazing restaurant .
experience : the food really let me down .
service comes from management and management stems from leadership .
employees and customers alike .
other than that it ' s great .
great service and friendly and knowledgeable wait staff .
can recommend with confidence .
"bread was fresh , though butter was uninspired ."
"overall , an average place for its price ."
by far the best night club in vegas .
not a good sign for this location .
the glass was labelled ` ` fosters ' ' .
i really can not recommend this place .
allowing customers to balance account at the teller .
horrible policy set by jimmy johns .
no peppers on my sub .
if you are busy ... ask for help .
lots of empty tables .
waaaaay too much attitude from the female bartenders here .
look elsewhere for mower repair .
no wing night at this place .
great atmosphere and service .
even the local ace or harbor freight are better .
to summary : 0 .
pretty decent taiwan food in the valley .
check their bbb review .
i do learn a lot from this guy !
well for only 0.00 its may be ok .
placed order online and went to pickup .
however the dish is still delicious and well composed .
i went with the red curry this time .
the dipping sauce was spot on though .
"it is a fairly small , lounge style place ."
the bartenders and cocktail servers 0000 uniforms are fun .
went there on a sunday night around 0 .
this is for thrifty car rental at the airport .
very well done here .
service is always excellent .
they do everything very well .
i enjoyed all of them .
the 0000 square foot penthouse was wonderful .
we were well treated and everything was great .
"first , stay basic here ."
work from the margarita base and add pepperoni .
it still tastes great but it preserves the crust .
it ' s not premium ice cream .
and five 00 does pizza well .
a walk bridge connects the aria and cosmopolitan .
"additionally , corner <UNK> at mgm are perfect ."
i was not let down .
"indeed , the menu is generally the same ."
the tuna tartare was very good .
the strip was cooked perfectly .
"still , it was pretty dang good ."
makes the experience even better .
top notch all the way .
"as always , egg works rocks it out ."
not only that they have great food .

"oh <UNK> , you <UNK> <UNK> ."
a plethora of sauces ?
check ben this amazing new spot in little italy .
- rrb - and promptly had socks blown off .
and apparently a liquor license is in the works ?
i ' ll be back for sure .
big wood dining table ?
maybe i should learn how to make them myself ?
my interest was muy piqued .
"first and foremost , come here for the eats ."
"after yoga at <UNK> , of course ."
it ' s effectively an annex of <UNK> .
maybe just the <UNK> © de <UNK> ?
so actually scratch those to downsides on second thought .
i certainly hope to be back soon .
i love me some pies .
the service is garbage as well .
a must in the jewelry business .
why did wing <UNK> fort mill close ?
lived here for nine months .
nice quiet place to live for young professionals .
- bathrooms : it is a weird setup .
enjoyed the filet mignon and the lobster with prawns .
"snob , i get it ."
that ' s another thing ; the seats suck .
biscuits and gravy are bomb .
and the people watching and <UNK> is top notch .
"beyond that , walking along the paths is ridiculous ."
i went today looking for <UNK> owls .
the ponds are <UNK> watered .
"ground shrimp , no thanks ."
"get you own water , if necessary ."
"the food is 0 star , in my opinion ."
i had been here on one previous occasion .
"<UNK> , our server , was great , too ."
"it was windy , and stormy ."
cool change of weather .
can you tell i ' m holding out ?
but i can not help it now .
"flat , bland , and uninspiring ."
my gf ordered the taco salad with blackened mahi .
the salad was a heap of shit .
that was after i had picked through the onions .
"black beans , canned as well ."
the food was even better here .
"settled on the enchilada , tostada , taco combo ."
worth the little detour from the bertos brothers .
"the place was busy , but not overly so ."
comes with the turf .
i ' m thinking i ' m being fair .
winner winner chicken dinner .
but not quite the win i had in mind .
i liked the <UNK> .
the beans were a little heavy on the lard .
next up ; delux .
"went in , got seated promptly ."
"$ 0.0 , and $ 0 respectively ."
"grand total , $ 00 ."
the bread on the burger was a little firm .
just a ho-hum meal .
"after football practice , this was a must ."
"have n't strayed much from that , honestly ."
"thanks for the memories , tokyo express ."
"great food , incredible beer , and great times ."
"' ' listen here , server girl ."
i ' ll get to the good part now .
the food is <UNK> .
huge fan of the red curry .
"the fried rice is very good , also ."
the food is easily a 0 .
food continues to be exceptional .
it ' s too bad they got the boot .
"service blew , but the food was fantastic ."
my gf ordered the turkey benedict .
like 00 out of 00 hot .
"not much a gripe , just a preference ."
this is an <UNK> review .
my gf does not eat beef or pork .
got an intestine filled quesadilla .
"<UNK> the burrito , also ."
glad we could help out the coyotes of arizona .
just not going to ever happen .
it went all downhill from there .
the food really is that good .
i was expecting shit rolled into a tortilla .
the service was exceptional .
the service was awesome .
glasses refilled before hitting the e light .
"chips full , until we asked for no mas !"
the food was incredible .
breaking apart when you pick it up .
the 0 year old got a taco .
they were almost better than what i ordered .
' ' and the world is full of haters .
"yelpers , do n't hate on a good thing ."
"$ 0.00 margaritas no gimmicks , no shenanigans ."
the service was still excellent .
these cheese crisps are the best in town .
this is the best mexican food in the valley .
the lemonade is fresh squeezed and made in house .
"honestly , the ap ' s were bomb !"
china chili kept appearing .
"great texture , great smell ... it was fantastic ."
"great flavor , great texture ."
the breaded shrimp was perfect .
"tried one , and it was spot on ."
got there at 0:00 .
several minutes later she returned .
i talked to my manager and he said no .
"me , gf , and 0 yr old ."
it was damn good .
that one is tough to wrap my mind around .
"overall , this is a quality experience ."
"shitty service , and overpriced food ."
call me a douche .
went to <UNK> today for a late lunch .
only because of the interior decor .
"' ' let ' s address , shall we ?"
that ' s 00 years .
while you were talking shit with your co-worker ?
she ' s 0 feet tall and an athlete .
that is unacceptable service .
"again , <UNK> and unacceptable ."
"for $ 0 , i expected more ."
my gf ordered the fish & chips .
"the fish was average , and bland ."
no condiments with the burger .
it was <UNK> dead .
just saying ... i digress .
"focus on making simple , flavorful and quality food ."
because of the band and great vibe on sundays .
"had 0 beers , instead ."
this place rocks for what it is .
"this pita came stuffed with succulent , tasty meat ."
my gyro was oozing sauce .
"quite the dilemma , i tell you ."
parking was no issue .
all of this for less than $ 0 .
this is the better chinese buffet in surprise .
"the servers are friendly , and affable ."
i ' ve been here on 0 occasions .
"both times have been good , quality experiences ."
grilled to absolute perfection .
gf had the <UNK> <UNK> .
she gave it a 0.0 .
great for a <UNK> .
i ' d have eaten it .
what more could you want ?
why the review now ?
what a bunch of crap .
the food was absolute shit .
i do n't eat at mcdonald ' s .
have n't in 00 years .
a family owned and operated joint in scottsdale ?
but we loved every fat round belly inducing bite .
we ' re not very cool at all .
what else can i get you ?
' ' and the new order was promptly served .
"that said , a must go ."
scared me to death .
0 group of 0 eating breakfast .
<UNK> syrup is the worst .
i settled on the western omlet .
"no hash browns , either ."
they were ` ` out ' ' .
' ' i ca n't make this stuff up .
"it was just flat , and bland ."
"no thanks , rock springs ."
"crusts are flour , water , graham cracker ."
i ' m all done with rock springs .
that ' s it ... drown it in mayo .
"well , 0 things ."
it ' s 000 degrees outside today in phoenix .
is there a better meal than breakfast ?
"good food , but no real maple syrup ."
twin peaks and scottsdale were made for each other .
that sort of set the tone for the place .
happy hour menu is $ 0 off the beer .
this place is a bust .
see what i did there ?
"if you score , you got ta post it ."
i purchase the works wash everytime i go in .
on all 0 of my vehicles .
i <UNK> around $ 000 a month in washes .
it can be quite a challenge .
today i went in and had the car washed .
this place is great .
i could n't put the gyro down .
the falafel was dynamic .
"tons of robust , <UNK> flavors <UNK> my mouth ."
"i will be be back regularly , and frequently ."
that in and of itself is worth 0 stars !
what more can you ask for ?
i ' ll tell you .
good coffee is a must even in <UNK> environments .
the food is awesome .
food was so-so and the service was bad .
great place and reasonable prices .
thanks for nothing guys .
this is the best italian restaurant in az . .
my dull knife made this completely <UNK> .
cheap food is a rarity on the plateau .
this place is cheap and good .
the pulled pork hash was excellent .
"i ' m originally from austin , texas ."
"in austin , this place would be pretty ordinary ."
service was very good .
did i mention the owners being cool ?
instead expect the unexpected .
the salads were large and colorful .
what ' s the alternative ?
all the girls are friendly and professional .
definitely getting my next hair cut there .
spreading the word to all my friends and co workers
great service and clothes always done on time .
i did not have many positive experiences .
internet fees were $ 00.00 a day .
needless to say i would not recommend .
awesome spot to stay while in vegas .
. the rooms are really nice clean and spacious .
feel free to try a few .
this restaurant is top notch .
the side dishes were excellent ... the cheesecake devine .
go here because this place is fantastic .
everything else combined for a great meal .
i counted a total of 0 tvs .
the food is good and the atmosphere is bland .
- rrb - presented in this establishment .
this place was trying too hard .
"anyway , onto the food ."
it kind of defeats the purpose of ordering veggies .
"overall , a very bland meal and atmosphere ."
one of my favorite restaurant ' s in charlotte .
the <UNK> alone makes it a pleasure .
excellent choice for special events or a networking luncheon .
proper chocolate mouse should be the consistency of pudding .
the lobster tail was huge .
i ordered mine medium and wow was it tender .
decided to eat there yesterday .
real homemade greek cusine .
even the home fries where spicy .
service was my biggest issue .
this i assure you was not the case .
"they were moist , but firm , and favorable ."
overall this place was great .
not a soul was in the place .
this place is amazing .
"terrific atmosphere , great beer selections and amazing food ."
the food is terrific .
looking for a good sandwich ?
try the 000 with the pickled jalapeã ± os .
this place is exactly what downtown phoenix needed .
not like anything else in arizona .
it ' s built into two houses .
the food is top notch .
also ca n't hurt that they have strongbow .
amazing food for amazing prices .
the breakfast burritos are the highlight of the menu .
their hot sauce they provide is lights out .
the food is n't bad .
i really like the green chili chicken sandwich .
the prices border ` ` over-priced .
for the most part it ' s been good .
let ' s keep this review simple .
love the atmosphere of the small brick building .
the best sandwich shop in az hands down !
i stand by the staple dilly club .
all terrific and delicious .
took 00 minutes to get it taken care of .
awesome that they have a 00 day warranty .
"that being said , this place is the best ."
great view of camelback mountain .
"ordered latte , extra hot with minimal foam ."
parking and entry was easy approaching from the west .
"latte was good , coffee of high quality ."

he put me into my first <UNK> <UNK> .
then the first cycle cross .
then into the first <UNK> mountain bike .
this place is good .
i saw this place and said why not .
that thing was loaded with meat .

then you ' ve been to <UNK> ' s .
epicentre is a cool place .
it ' s a large establishment .
"well , good coffee i suppose ."
i quite liked the place .

the breakfast buffet closes at 00am .
instead i just got the normal buffet fare .
"instead , i only probably did $ 00 ."
the place is fine for a cup of joe .
"they have seating , internet , people watching outside ."
"during lunch , the people watching is quite good ."
came for a bachelor party .
i ' ve had better bbq .
"was expecting deliciousness , but received average bbq ."
salad is a great value here - $ 0 .
pulled pork was dry .
"the brisket were slices , like london broil ."
overall it was ok .
second time i ' ve been here .
beer on tap - check .
inflated prices for being in an airport - check .
well that was popcorn shrimp .
the waitresses and dancers are quite good looking .
there ' s bull riding in an area .

there is an upstairs and a downstairs .
"' ' nothing against that , just noticed it ."
the beef is cooked when you order .
this place was a nice hotel .
$ 0 coffee mondays ?
"tons of tvs , good beer flights ."
the establishment itself is nice - really large .
the crowd is <UNK> and mostly caucasian .
it was an enjoyable place i think .
but that ' s just being picky .
i ' m not done .
there are better buffets in other caesars properties .
i had the mr . miyagi burger .
one of the best burgers of my life .
the fondue is fantastic and out of this world .
i really only suggest <UNK> dishes though .
stop what you are doing and eat here .
if you are a fan of a . 0 .
the ingredients are fresh and tasty .
"for now , i had the <UNK> milkshake ."
parking was tough though .
the owner knows me too .
some of the best dishes beef tataki - yes .
the service was pretty good .
it hits the spot and fills me up .
the service was really spot on though .
the <UNK> table is really cool too .
onto the most important part ... the food !

the pictures speak a thousand words .
i also like all the appetizers and the gyoza .

nice couple running a cool little sub shop .
good alternative to subway .
"nothing great , but good nonetheless ."
over all a good time .
best new mexican in arizona ... easily .
watched mon night football .
made me and my bro sick .
"no hops at all , tasted like a lager ."
rooms are nothing out of the ordinary .
it ' s a trek .
another con : no poker room .
another fine cds show .
- pick up tickets early in the day .
we were really close to the action .
thanks fellow yelpers for a great find .
food was served piping hot and was outstanding .
absolutely hate noah ' s bagels .
def worth a stop .
pints are mostly around $ 0 .
"solid , generous portions ."
my last visit i had the loco moco .
usually a lengthy wait .
why even stay open .
skip it on illinois game days .
overpriced for what they offer .
food came out fast and it was tasty .
my wife and i chowed down on everything .
james at the bar made some really good recommendations .
the place is right next to pizzeria bianco .
well the lady there said to come here .
sat at the bar .
they had a great selection of premium scotches .
they also had 0 barrel aged cocktails .
i tried the pacific coast and it was awesome .
you must try the lamb burger .
both bartenders made the dinner experience pleasant .

the food was subpar for the price .
extensive menu and attentive service .
"food is awesome , service is excellent ."
they have all been great .
the meal ... wow ! ! .
i had chicken parm that tasted old & re-heated .
enter at your own risk .
the food was n't just your standard buffet fair .
the flavor level was beyond buffet level .
oh and the deserts !
do n't get me started on the deserts !
just make sure you save room for desert .
a very exciting and high energy german style restaurant .
the loudness is what this place strives for .
even the german beer was fantastic .
it ' s not bad for the price .
visit it when ever we are in las vegas .
lots of hot guys .
most knowledgeable staff in town .
with the most mods and juices .
all the ingredients for an excellent dining experience .
the name says it all .
the managers attitude alone forced my party to leave .
they still honored the warranty and fixed the problem .
"food ' s excellent , service ' s excellent ."
it does n't get any better than this .
fries are a bit bland .
reduce your menu and keep only the good stuff .
no server no water .
"from there , no server for 00 minutes ."
"great food , service and chill environment ."
try the prime rib and taiwanese popcorn chicken .
i tipped out of sheer embarrassment for the staff .

very nice and friendly a very positive dinning experience .
spend your money here .
the food was amazing .
great for a date night or with friends .

forget the other overpriced guys .
. its definitely a kid friendly environment .
he was spot on from start to finish .
and a three stars one in some shady alley .
"they have everything , but good luck finding it ."
note to ccw / <UNK> carry folks .
the dent and ding insurance is worthless .
"good hamburgers , chicken and fish sandwiches ."
i really enjoyed this place .
now for the downside .
"but graphics , videos , <UNK> , et ."
second time was the rueben .
"it was good , but nothing outstanding ."
"eat at your own risk , good or bad ."
the pub chip shop specializes in this & chips .
tell them <UNK> ' s sent ya !

something is just wrong about this place .
"bottle service , vip and a good atmosphere ."
you ca n't deny the place .

smoking hookah can be a bit expensive .
the selection of games does n't stop there though .

the ribeye was my favorite .
0.0 stars had the farm burger .
but not blown away either .

but it does n't live up to the hype .
lots of tvs w / sound .
raffles on game days .
the beef tasted pretty good .
both were just great .
service was good enough though .
waitress did very well .
scallops were a good size and well cooked .
nothing too special here .
not bad but not great .
the grits and biscuit made up for it .
they had a surprising amount of beers listed .
another solid stay at an <UNK> hotel .
i stayed here for 00 days back in october .
nice rooms and very spacious hotel .
valet is available and the hotel restaurant is decent .
oil change was done quickly .
reservations were made only a week prior .
i got ta tell ya .
what a waste of labor dollars .
vodka and the <UNK> stuff for $ 0 each ?
i make way better ones at home .
` ` photo on facebook ' ' .

the food at this place is excellent .
they are strong believe me .
their desserts are very good .
wow is it good .
this is a must try for $ 0.00 ?
or before the alcohol .
this place is amazing .
everything for breakfast is pretty much great .
"second , the room itself sucks ."
our tour guide jimmy was drunk .
that does n't affect the taste of the beer .
nice rooms but thin walls .
close walking distance to downtown activities .
charming spot on the north side of charlotte .
the food was awesome .
greatly <UNK> this newly opened museum .
nice bar but very quiet .
wine by the glass selection was fair at best .
great atmosphere and service .
big screens in the bar area to watch games .
the digital signs at the car wash are <UNK> .
"on time , clean , and very honest ."
"i would defiantly use again , and recommend ."
would n't do anything to support this ownership .
everything here is knock your socks off insanely good .
really go there now .
do yourself a favor and check this place out .
best burger i have every had in my life .
their new hamburger is absolutely insane .
this place is dead .
"new owners who hate punks , <UNK> and weirdos ."
avoid at all costs .
you guys ruined a great spot .
nice people and good food .
best thai in pgh .
some of the best pizza in pittsburgh .
"exceptional crust , great sauce and perfectly cooked ."
give it a shot .
dj tell your staff to cheer up a little .
the most boring generic menu ever created .
a real masterpiece in horrible life choices .
lives up to all the hype .
first of all stop over cooking my meat .
best meal i have had in years .
avoid at all cost .
they will ruin your car .
first of all i felt unwelcome .
their tone was negative and unwelcoming .
it was a highlight in taste but poor service .
duck speck was excellent .
this place is real .
<UNK> has character and a soul .
"great cheap drinks , great service , great food ."
a place you can feel normal and happy at .
too rich for my wife .
the service was excellent .
i would go to <UNK> ' s again .
the rooms at planet hollywood are disgusting .
the carpet is filthy and has waved .
the food was mediocre at best .
<UNK> till pomegranate returns !
they have a great selection that changes daily .
me and my girl love this place .
"it was perfect w / excellent jus , too !"
adding to the experience was the excellent food .
only the cole slaw was a bit bland .
"you get charged for all these leads , regardless ."
but this place short pours the drinks .
what sort of cigar lounge closes at 0: 00 ?
will definitely go back for next years again .
i agree with <UNK> ' s review down below .
great bang for the buck .
first time trying this place .
the only bad part were the cookies to finish .
not a very good end to creative cuisine .
lack of bigger ticket food items for the price .
iced tea is very good here as well .
they can easily provide you with everything you need .
i was thinking ... ` ` really ' ' ?
really giving you that sense of street magic .
"from boats , to <UNK> and swimming ."
"bring your camera , and have plenty of room ."
i think i should probably give this 0.0 stars .
well this is that store .
the food was fresh <UNK> nicely presented .
i had the mussels and they were excellent .
the service was prompt and helpful .
i would certainly recommend the beef ribs .
they were fantastic and meaty .
simple room with a view of nothing .
here is what might help .
the room was in great shape and very clean .
my wife and i had a reservation for 000 .
we were promptly seated and provided menus .
we had to ask for the early dining menu .
we selected the early dining menu items and ordered .
overall it was a great dinner .
the view was west toward the rio .
the room had a very comfortable king bed .
the pool area is fantastic also .
only negative was a rude check-out clerk .
not sure what more you can ask for .
rather than just bitch see what management says .
long line ... longest at the entire location .
average vehicle with average pricing .
typical rental car scam ... or similar means smaller .
the food is really good with high end ingredients .
i will be quick .
always the same high quality results and feedback .
solid italian meal that wo n't break the bank .
they responded promptly and rescued us .
plenty of tv ' s for all sports .
food - try the queso burger .
best fries in town .
i ' m here to play pinball !
i was greeted by wall of modern stern machines .
ohh yeah not to mention .
the coffee and espresso is all quality .
. i keep giving this place chances after chances .
. i ' ve given up altogether .
super quality game store with super awesome staff .
this place is so hit and miss .
sometimes the food is excellent .
. infact it was sub par .
the pizza may have a slight warmth to it .
but yeah ... was pretty disappointed .
however they too are relatively expensive .
. seven dollars for a slice of cake .
this place is freaking awesome .
this place is amazing .
they offer quality donuts of all sorts .
this place is a gem .
it has my 0 star review .
i could make it simple and say .
so when they ask how spicy be prepared !
delicious ... way better than a subway !
keep up the great work !
they recently re-opened and the new building is top-notch !
there is nobody around here .
service was 00/00 including servers recommendations .
warm shrimp mango roll and spicy tuna were awesome .
worth the drive from plateau .
cool atmosphere except the layout is strange .
the food and service here were very good .
which imo was the best meal of the night .
an aloft is an aloft is an aloft .
this one does not disappoint .
"for instance , the chicago hamburger co . ."
holy crap they are good .
the fries ? ? ? perfection .
or is pizza an <UNK> to you ?
pizza starts with the crust .
"conveyor belt pizza is <UNK> , meant for california ."
"holy crap thomas is spot on , hilarious ."
anyone want to buy it ?
their margarita and marinara za is killer .
better than places like <UNK> or <UNK> in ny ?
"pretty close , and damn good ."
forget about smiling doormen .
come by and get the best priced drinks around .
amazing banana fosters lumpia to complete the experience .
shout out to stellar service from christine !
0 stars for this place .
tried their irish stew <UNK> ' s pie .
the prices are substantially inflated on an uninspired menu .
it was a terrible old fashioned .
highly recommend avoiding this place .
it was all pretty bland .
this place is the bees knees .
could n't recommend this place more .
avoid at all costs .
the building is nice .
then why are they on the menu ?
but that ' s about it for the positives .
so i would n't recommend this place .
this was a great steak .
my wife says that the banana cream .
this is a great shop .
they produce your standard west coast doughnut .
. need i saw more ?
wow what a pleasant surprise .
the sauce that came with it was excellent .
beef sliders where very good .
grass fed beef done perfectly .
this is a beer drinkers paradise .
the noise also killed me .
well it being a sunday daily dose was packed .
the menu looked good enough .
the food itself underwhelmed .
what else do you need ?
and it sure could have in my case .
"all in all , a memorable , indulgent meal ."
beso off is the best way to put it .
there was this <UNK> guy listening to us .
draw your own <UNK> here .
i like chinese food .
the burgers themselves were fine .
all together it is comfortable in british style .
fair price great work .
. the bartender max was fantastic .
. i always get the hot trifecta shrimp boil .
. i suggest the pho or shaken beef
price was reasonable and the quality was good .
not crazy good but very good .
all very well done and tasty !
ca n't go wrong here .
the food is good bordering on great .
really good philly cheesesteak sandwich .
ambiance is ... similar to any fast food restaurant .
decent grub at a decent price .
the showroom is considerably larger than their previous location .
she was great and very friendly and upbeat .
my eye refuses to focus through the left lens .
- lrb - whatever that means .
drinks at the pool deck were expensive .
the sushi was excellent .
my impression of the food was hit and miss .
my sicilian omelet contained hand cut grape tomatoes .
well worth a stop .
this place is awful .
this is clearly false advertising .
overall great dinner minus the price ...
someone in the kitchen knows what they are doing .
go to this establishment and see for yourself .
waste of time and left hungry .
ate the hawaiian burger here .
you basically walk in one big circle .
me and my daughter love this place .
food was average and service sucked .
almost walked out after drink order .
one of the worst experiences ever .
friendly server and its all about the rolls .
thats basically all they do .
a somewhat limited menu variety wise .
this place was pretty good .
the flavor was great .
sort of a snotty place for this biker .
if your an oyster fan .
the wait time is a little slow .
there is n't any good music of a feel .
sorry to bother you with my money .
absent management sure to lead to a failure .
the pizza was ok .
"not bad , not great but ok ."
the bartender was nice and the atmosphere is good .
$ 00 for a porter house steak .
i had a very relaxing time here .
the seats were very comfortable as well .
i recommend the pork belly app as well .
great food and good portions .
"all in all , one of my favs ."
wings are decent and the pizza is traditional .
"great flavor , fair price ."
"oh sure , thats why it ' s empty ."
i only got a half heated apology .

had all the burgers and they are great .
outstanding craft beer choices also .
got up and left .
i go for the artisan pizza on the weekends .
plus they have local az beers on tap .
"fantastic service , authentic food , and excellent cocktails ."
no redeeming qualities here .
it was hardly edible .
anyway the beer was good .
mine was supposed to be medium-rare .
good gyro and good fries .
sit on the roof .
terrific working with this business .
incredible artwork and designer posters appropriately line the walls .
expectations of a place creates the review .
make it your next stop in the west valley !
"and then , enjoy your dinner ."
the breakfast buffet leaves a lot to be desired .
the food was impeccable as well as the spirits .
i ordered an omelette with a cup of coffee .
mac & cheese burger ? ! come on now !
<UNK> is all about the sashimi .
"very average food , especially for what they charge ."
but $ 00.00 for a jameson on the rocks ?
that ' s a little ridiculous .
i can not see them lasting at these prices .
a land of false hopes and shattered dreams .
maybe that ' s what attracted me ?
"that said , an escape was in order ."
jaw dropping wonder and <UNK> insane glory .
le <UNK> was almost a dream .
it certainly seemed <UNK> .
dreaming big is essential in vegas .
the title is appropriate .
they are all willing to help you out .
the sauce they used was delicious .
treat them as special bonuses during your meal .
the sushi itself was above average i would say .
the roast beef unbelievably moist and tender though .
this place <UNK> mexican cuisine .
pros : 0 - rrb - amazing breakfast .
the best part was the made-to-order grill .
"it was about 0 minutes , no joke ."
excellent service cant be taught .
worst hotel experience i have ever had .
"great burgers , fries and onion rings ."
"authentic , amazing and real mexican food ."
we just had a cancellation he said at 0:00 .
"i chuckled saying yeah , pretty much ."
dinner was filling and real of the old country .
this place should have all the stars .
"cool , local , hipster place ."
the fried calamari was standard .
go with the beer .
security at every entrance .
evidently this happens with expedia all the time .
parking - you can either valet or self park .
went here on the recommendation of our hotel .
"inside , it looks like a cute italian restaurant ."

"as i mentioned though , the food was great ."
authentic mexican at its best .
the street tacos are fairly new and are awesome !

the only area that needs improvement is the service .
slightly overpriced this place is the best .

this place is a rip off .
not what it used to be .
do they ever clean it ?

<UNK> pizza was outstanding .
the reason for three stars ?

"after that , service seemed disjointed ."
everything about the transaction was an absolute joy .
0/0 the cost of one tire at vw .
i ' ll be going elsewhere after that .
"housekeeping knocks , i yell ` occupied ."
finally they transfer me to a housekeeping supervisor .
rep notes how long the line is down there .
his wife could n't get a manager either .
"do you have no decency , ph ?"
save yourself the aggravation and go somewhere else !
i recommend trying practically anyone else in henderson .
the fedex across the street was great .
linda however saved the day .
was quoted a price .
it was worth every penny .
the second was on break .
not a bad deal .
found a $ 00 shirt that fit perfectly .
they did n't seem to pick up at that .
"went through two panels , 0 cell units ."
still had the same issue .
"will never , ever do business again with them ."
"great place , great environment ."
comedian was funny as hell .
"major thanks to rachel , who saved the day ."

i checked in 0 hours early with no problems .
so the size is good .
they had about 0 or 0 suitcases .

they upped the prices .
that kind of stuff happens .
when the work is good thats ok .

other tables just gave up and left .
nothing else is walkable from this hotel .
one person only working floor of restaurant .
it took an hour to get our breakfast .

some nights the restaurant was empty .
management needs to keep an eye on this .
fortunately there was someone who helped him out .

<UNK> is a great place with amazing food .
everything i have ever ordered has been top notch .
staff was friendly and responsive .
room was fantastic - well appointed .
"among the few , would certainly recommend ."
many quality restaurants and shops .
i believe it took an hour door to door .
there are companies that fly out of lv airport .
you wont be disappointed .
"although its not venice , italy it was outstanding ."
excellent breakfast at an excellent venue .
food and service was outstanding .
so good went back the next morning .
staff was courteous and attended to our needs .
think dennys / ihop type fare and indifferent service .
"nothing special , at all ."
better off at the food court .
lunch or dinner must be their strong point .
food was just ok .
pretty small portions for the prices they charge .
really nothing special and the place is pretty ghetto .
first and last time here .
this place is a huge rip off .
they should just shut it down .
it is pretty much a smaller version of ebc .
good place to eat especially when hungover .
"cheap , fast , great food for the price ."
it gets the job done .
for the most part service was good .
great seafood selection and ambiance .
great neighborhood spot with an eye towards classic cocktails .

carol gets 0 stars heather gets 0 !
fire hazard and a shithole to boot .
xs made this place look like a dump .
you ' ll not see anyone famous .
however the great prices make up for a lot .
"decor nothing special , a little run down ."
coal ovens produce very high heat .
very close to pizza perfection .
the various pork and chicken dishes were excellent .
however the real test is how it tastes .
"it was very good , better than most pizzerias ."
yet there is on huge problem .
prices are virtually identical .
the best lies only lies about a mile away .
"' ' , i replied ."
my free chips soon arrived as did my salsa .
i must say they looked quite good .
the in house made guac was excellent .
just say a big no for the mexican .

the place is very clean .
one of my go to stops in vegas .
these dudes bang out seriously good chow !

the service was average .
"for that reason , the food was overpriced ."
"so far , casino food sucks in vegas ."
"decent flavor , good crust ."
i ' ll be back .
ca n't be best .
yelp recommended the <UNK> as all of the above .
very affordable authentic thai food .
the eggplant in garlic sauce is phenomenal .
you wo n't be sorry if you eat here .
great pizza at a great price .
it was almost <UNK> of a creamsicle .
and the <UNK> are drop dead .
go with the <UNK> breakfast burrito w / beans .
especially if you just ran 0-0 miles .
spicy chicken burrito was a big hit at sema .
hope you expand to so cal soon .
he <UNK> recommended the bread pudding .
the banana creme pie was excellent .
"but , the bread pudding was better than excellent ."
horrible service from the bartender .
only getting 0 stars cause its cheap .
lol not at all a fan of guy himself .
"however , this place is bomb ."
"this place had it all , and quality ."
small place with marginal service but good food .
had the hot and sour soup .
what is it with chinese places and ice ?
don is from chicago .
his partners are lettuce entertain you .
chicago boys as well .
here are a few tips .
in my eyes the best ribs you can get .
it ' s you not the ribs .
everything is now ala carte .
"i hate it , my wife loves it ."
the meat comes from <UNK> in chicago .
they are prime steaks .
best blue cheese dressing in the world .
get the au gratin .
if you like fires get the skinny fries .
the burgers not so much .
the hot fudge sundae is awesome .
the pork chops are not the same as chicago .
the only problem is no leftovers .
is it that good ?
the service is friendly but really slow .
their thin crust is very thin and very crisp .
"there is ample sauce , cheese and great ingredients ."
this is very good pizza .
think <UNK> ' s on steroids .
no canned mushrooms or peppers here .
it ' s almost a negative incentive .
you will easily pay $ 00 plus a pizza .
also very good pizza but different .
from chicago as well .
service was great but food was just ok .
this one has many good qualities .
again very good flavor and not supper greasy .
the service was excellent and the prices were reasonable .
they had both met working for big fat greek .
"yeah , they make it from scratch ."
their minestrone is very good .
their pizza is very good as well .
good but not great .
but this is az so what do you want .
the other deserts are pretty good as well .
it is one of my three top chicago places .
the burger is better than that <UNK> place .
my son and i ordered the <UNK> bacon burger .
but its all about the food .
"well , not sure about their bacon ."
go for lunch get a combo .
good chicken rice soup and good pad thai .
"it was bad , really bad ."
hands down the worst satay i have ever had .
"tough , chewy and stringy ."
and i used to enjoy it .
the fries were five stars though .
the burgers are fresh but small .
the fries are excellent .
it ' s a solid good .
i have never had pizza like this in chicago .
"village inn , home run inn ."
"<UNK> ' s , <UNK> ' s ."
what do you think ?
its <UNK> so you know what your getting .
the beef comes from midwestern meats .
it ' s vienna but not a natural casing .
it ' s also a good place for kids .
my 0 year old loves a gyro .
the plate is a great deal .
better than the pita meal .
four stars for a place in an airport .
anyway back to the burger .
and to the person whose bottom bun was soggy .
so add tip to that as well .
you have to pay if you want good food .
what it ' s not .
this is one hot dog .
my chicago food cred is second to none .
just like in chicago .
it has a nice clean casual atmosphere .
they even have pho in the name right .
the beef was to sweet and a bit tough .
the spring rolls look really good as well .
this is a review more about service than products .
if they had an opening sometime that day .
they did n't even have a barber .
so much for trying the royal shave .
how do you call that shaving ?
"after all , the ."
but as far as product goes .
for my review of the product and why .
http://url buy the way .
but it will be 0 stars .
they have a real oven with a stone deck .
even the pepperoni is good .
the service is prompt yet cold .
the food though is good .
it ' s new york cantonese .
not quite as good as chicago but close .
as one other person put it .
their best deals are lunch specials .
they need a fryer .
the waiter had other things on his mind .
that ' s a good thing by the way .
this place is better than <UNK> .
still did n't take the plates .
they should have been cooked longer .
the basha ' s next door .
they have a brick oven .
to me it ' s all about the food .
my wife and sister got the salads to start .
my wife did not like the blue cheese .
do n't get blue cheese at an italian restaurant .
that ' s my comparison for it .
a pretty high standard for sure .
this is something that is special to chicago .
google it and look at the pictures .
that is if you go here after reading this .
that ' s what it should look like .
my wife got eggplant parmesan .
google that as well .
the sauce was really bad .
the red sauce was very good though .
papa johns or domino ' s .
maybe the thin crust would have been better .
some people like arby ' s .
i do like chipotle by the way .
"friendly staff , nice atmosphere and near metro <UNK> ."
the food looks stale and old .
this place is not worth the effort .
. i ' ll tell you why 0 .
good bar service and here is a tip .
excellent spot inside the palazzo .
my wife had an omelette with bacon .
really nice char on it and a delicious pink .
really good piece of meat .
super good eats for cheap .
"excellent place , went here twice in a week ."
fantastic to try new stuff .
ate lunch there today .
food was average tasting and a typically local joint .
used to eat here 00 years ago for breakfast .
have been told breakfast is still good .
had the burger bowl and it was very tasty .
two other burgers at table and both were excellent .
"had chips , salsa and diet coke ."
salsa was watery but chips were hot .
$ 00 bucks for what i had .
a good place for different quick breakfast or lunch .
the wynn buffet is mainly about quantity .
is there a better burger joint in az ?
bumper is kool as hell .
"if you want good ink , go see them ."
"kool bar , great crew , wicked atmosphere ."
one of my regular spots .
"best in vegas , imo ."
the staff were all very polite and knowledgeable .
"and the ride , you ask ?"
miso soup was watered down and tasteless .
poor tasting fish and small servings .
ate it 0 times this past weekend .
bring lube : you ' ll definitely need it .
"no problem , that will be $ 0 ."
"sure , that ' ll be $ 0 ."
not worth a rat ' s ass !
the staff was friendly and ready to serve .
i enjoy flying us airways .
"good breakfast , nice location and comfortable ."
the food here is amazing .
chef mark designed a stunning menu .
"for the price , it ' s worth staying ."

best mexican in town !
call scott and you wo n't be disappointed .

instead your just paying for a decent looking casino .
drank 0 straight nights here .
overall a good place .
the cheddar appetizer was awesome !
"this place rocks , keep it up mike !"
hopefully they get shut down before they kill someone .
the sushi here is off the charts .
very tasty organic mexican food .
at a bargain price .
"sounds <UNK> , but also has some bad <UNK> ."
screw off cold stone .
disclaimer : deep dish rules all .
"they were cheap , plentiful , and damn tasty ."
"for a few moments , at least ."
and i ' d be a happy man .
the pie was also a must-try .
a simple mistake or is that how zupas rolls ?
and most importantly - it ' s good .
things usually <UNK> into a shit show .
"also , i barely got any hash browns ."
this is greek food as i know it .
disclaimer : i heart the university ymca
then the tranny started acting up .
"for the price , superb ."
and it ' s good and a great value .
parking is tough around here .
everything about the all you can eat was outstanding .
not just for me but for family .
close at 0pm and closed on sundays .
the place is new and very nice .
the facilities are large and well lit .
the staff is very friendly .
the selection is amazing .
great selection and staff .
overall a 0.0 star .
i had the 0 piece fish n chips .
good food and pretty good service .
the first visit i had the steak and eggs .

refills were pretty quick .

excellent driver and excellent service .
the menu is good .
"fish tacos good , salads good ."
eat at the counter its quicker .
the burgers are very good .
bar with a normal atmosphere .
to many stupid slot parlors in this town now !
chinese food is well prepared .
sports games have the sound on .
betting to much money is not a good idea .
stay away from the rewards card when betting sports .
"wine very good , bread excellent ."
"stone crabs are great , crab cakes great ."
the sound is good for shows .
very nice tv ' s and bar area .
two for one apps with coupon .
the big kahuna & the italian are very good .
00.00 and no meat .
decent but slow and insanely overpriced .
i had a nickel bet on the <UNK> .
atleast i won the bet .
the place was extremely dark inside .
this is an outstanding restaurant ! ! ! .
and the deep dish pizza .
and the deep dish pizza takes 00min .
never heard of this place .
"the food was fresh , tasty and well prepared ."
very authentic mexican food .
appreciate the choice of sauces and condiments .
replaced the key lock on the front basement door .
one very obviously from a very shoddy repair job .
had to replace the entire landing gear .
"fantastic steaks , sides and service ."
the ac wall unit was falling apart .
i would use sauced again in a minute .
just saved me $ 0000.00 .
"room was small , but was very good ."
this place truly captures that essence .
great steak cooked wonderfully .
i would n't expect a flawless experience .
i would not recommend doing business with this company .
nice way to do business .
the food here is excellent .
my friends soup was quite good .
"again , all excellent ."
they have everything that most great buffets do .
"however , the quality was a step above ."
really a classy place .
"street tacos were fantastic , great presentation as well ."
yet this is xtreme sushi i suppose .
the tea was served in a sticky coffee mug .
i give an ` f ' for presentation .
hmmm ... lower bill total = lower tip perhaps ?
someone needed to shut that down .
it is the best in las vegas .
the food was just ok .
then he reads people ' s minds ?
perhaps she was not trained properly .
one could hope though .
nice big <UNK> showroom with a bar and restroom .
well lit and cool stage effects .
outstanding selection and fair prices !
"and , better prices than game stop !"
my wife and i ate there for lunch today .
sales department is useless .
. - lrb - good thing - rrb - .

garlic fries is the way to go .
the times they are a <UNK> .
room service food was average .
great value ... true non-smoking room .
good room service food .
and the food was decent .
the place was empty only three family .
he knows a lot about the area .
"amazing meal , fairly entertaining show , great company ."
i ca n't believe this establishment allows this treatment .
everything was cooked perfectly and tasted great !
this review is about <UNK> company in general .
this place refused to to take a gift certificate .
a staple for any vegas visit .
camarones a la diabla was amazing .
chicken katsu is the standard crispy panko fried chicken .
start serving beer and i ' d never leave .
"in fact , it was accurate ."
i was seen there and everything went well .
look here at your own risk !
average burger place for what i expected .
might have to try that next time .
"the waiter was attentive , courteous , and knowledgeable ."
save room for other stuff .
wine list is extensive and expensive .
"anyways , more importantly , the food ."
great wines and very good food .
this place is an absolute gem .
do not eat here .
neither had any flavor .
the buns and the fries were stale .
met some buddies in pittsburgh for the weekend .
great staff and good food .
wifi could be way better .
wo n't retrieve it in your room .
thank you for your hard work .
f & f ' s had just that .
it seems like a simple request .
super pizza has better knots .
even thinking about getting the prism tv .
thats new to me .
now for my second plate .
now i ' m losing hope .
the service there was very good .
not worthy of a review on its own .
never again will i order from here .
you are rushed along like an assembly line worker .
they used to at least pile it on .
this costco is nice but not phenomenal .
for her to cut the stems and assemble .
' never again will this company get my business .
"simply put , i was wrong ."
more is better in this case .
the menu was full of many different options .
all i needed was a sim card .
"not a bottle , a glass of water ."
and not a 0 star place at all .
love love love raising canes !
horrible service and slow to boot .
great food but can be a bit pricey .
no offense just never got into the craze .
thanks for making me a believer in food trucks !
avoid ! ! ! used to be 0 stars .
very nice to see .
i get it and they screwed up the pizza .
pizza was mediocre at best .
no free pizza for me they said .
i will never waste my money with them again .
' he says ` everything but water damage ' .
"` krispy kreme ' , she says ."
shame on you tc ' s .

shredded beef tacos were best part of lunch .
"good food , great service , descent prices ."
"thanks mr <UNK> , thanks for hooking us up !"
good job nick and crew .
have no complaints about this place at all .
cool little place to stop for some quick drinks .
going through security gate .
and will accommodate more people .
"cheap , whole in the wall place ."
the ordering system is lame .
the sandwiches are normal for a chain .
the selection of vegetables is pretty thin .
the service was excellent .
the work was complete within 00hrs of request .
the atmosphere is a ok ... typical local bar .
honestly the best in town .
oh btw the cheesesteaks rock !
the owner and staff seemed really friendly .
bagels are ok ... not great by far .
i ' m not sure those bagels were boiled .
they offer superb service and a well crafted menu .
fried chicken is the bomb .
the sides were ok but what i expected .
good ny style pizza .
they do n't deliver contrary to some sites .
great to support a local pizza place .
hot gold - best .
the install is flawless .
thanks for the great job cody and big mike
for $ 0 they gave us a lot .
what the hell is up with this place ?
how about 0/0 of the amount with quality toppings ?
chips & guacamole are excellent as well .
the quail was cooked perfectly .
the pho was very good .
take a flight if going from charlotte to raleigh .
it trumps em ' all .
"but at the <UNK> , the service is awesome ."
my biggest gripe are the concession stands .
it is a really good sized sandwich .
i had the <UNK> chicken .
they were a great team .
i got the full interior and exterior detail .
in regards to the detail .
the inside of the windshield was beyond <UNK> .
maybe for a lower level wash .
"professional , accurate , honest , attentive , knowledgeable ."
we went with the 00 % <UNK> .
the answer ... ` ` yes ' ' .
the attention to detail was superb !
the wine selection was fantastic !
a gem of a place - with excellent service .
and the service from dave and anthony was superb !
the <UNK> guys in town for being so expensive .
wo n't let you put sweetener in your drink .
service is always great .
we need more places like this in las vegas .
the actual burger was tasteless .
"nothing like umami , even fat burger is tastier ..."
this is a great local bar .
had the fish sandwich and its tasty .
the chicken tender are also fresh not frozen .
nearly $ 00 for a mediocre juice .
services that i ' ve experienced were excellent .
highly recommended for honda maintenance and repair needs .
the mac n cheese was ok .
the croissant french toast with sausage was pretty good .
the ranch skillet was also appetizing .
it was more meat than breaded crust .
what the hell was i thinking ?
my go to store from now on .
the meal was pretty bad .
fajitas is just plain bad food .
ca n't speak for the mechanic work .
"great service , but sticky fingers ."
i had the john dory that was simply magnificent .
do n't miss it if in town .
couple of <UNK> before we get into the food .
... second service perfect say no more .
the sides could not save the meal however .
a dinner experience is most likely different .
the atmosphere definitively rings pub .
desert however went to a new level of decadence .
service was ... interesting .
"good , fast , ."
were you looking for a denny ' s ?
a really consistent lettuce venue .
"precisely the same excellent service , and food ."
so perfectly fried and tender beyond imagination .
these pancakes are apparently made to please sumo <UNK> !
decent price for enormous portions .
catch it while in sin city .
wine list is impressive .
ditto on my wife ' s chopped salad .
steaks were prepared correct but lacked flavor .
all in all pretty good .
you will be glad you did .
for a mandalay bay venue .
really open but not noisy open .
i ' d choose others .
show is about the differences between men and women .
really funny and presented well .
entrees were ... <UNK> .
my wife ordered the same steak but <UNK> .
she added a lobster tail as well .
her steak was rare really rare .
i highly recommend accurate automotive .
the draft beer selection was fairly basic .
i had a yuengling draft .
this place merits the high rating it has received .
the main problems were in the service area .
this bar would do well to heed that rule .
the ipa was $ 0 for a draft .
very well run and organized marathon .
the <UNK> line was real nice .
the snakes were good quality and well organized .
my experience was straight crap .
their layout is horrible .
this place is just crap .
flavor and texture was off .
had the chicken satay ... really good .
"chicken panang curry was decent , but really soupy ."
this place needs to close shop asap .
the jamon iberico was just very ok .
"the fries were very good , thin and crispy ."
"jack is awsome , always come back for more !"
i ' m going to keep this short .
she thinks this is the real deal as well .
they offered 0-0 different kinds of bbq sauce .
unfortunately the food reflects this .
"sleep ' s overrated anyway , right ?"
"overall , the place was great ."
... check it out for yourself .
or eat some garbage food at the food courts .
<UNK> and <UNK> flowed while waiting for our entrees .
the pools were always clean and well maintained .
here - my advice is to go elsewhere .
not well executed at all .
terrible show management - in all respects .
the best sushi in charlotte .
<UNK> next ownership will get it right .
nice place very cool the owner works there too .
i spoke to the mgr and toured the kitchen .
all the veggies were wilted .
small salad with salty bland dressing .
pizza basically is poor .
cheese was definitely not high quality mozzarella .
the side dishes cole <UNK> etc are sub par .
no issues with <UNK> out different sauces or cheese .
"had good service , and decent food every time ."
the idiot owners should be closed up .
all you can drink open bar ?
best all you can eat i ' ve had .
this is where i always take my honda fit .
closest nevada equivalent of bevmo .
do n't listen to the haters .
what a waste of time .
poor setup and crappy bar .
the pizza excellent and the salads were great .
these folks are awesome .
i really like this place .
is the very helpful and cheerful staff .
the vibe is really cool and relaxed .
the staff is incredibly friendly and attentive .
a really nice neighborhood sports bar .
really good coffee and friendly staff .
obviously they are short staffed and poorly trained .
"you suck so , so , sooooo bad here ."
go in and get one of their signature sandwiches .
make the world better .
cooked firm - - the way i like it .
the rooms were quiet and the ventilation was excellent .
sometimes it is n't just about the good food .
... it ' s the land of <UNK> toys .
"the rooms were clean though , hence 0 stars ."
"tasty food , and excellent service ."
our server elizabeth was amazing and attentive .
but it ' s still all good .
the menu is on point .
its worth the trip .
make sure you are hungry .
the food is amazing and seasoned well .
do yourself a favor and keep driving .
"funky , eclectic decorations ."
but honey thats where the buck stops .
but find something better .
honestly the food was cooking school level .
"<UNK> , not cool at all ."
i love boyz ii men !
"great show , will probably go see it again ."
its more of a casual place to me .
"extremely tasty , nice ambiance , and good <UNK> ."
"the food was good , and portions generous ."
0nd time frequenting this establishment .
okay i went here twice .
went back recently to celebrate a friends birthday .
its turns into a nightclub at some point .
the gm was gracious in allowing us to enter .
no matter your orientation this place rocks .
"oh , do n't sleep on the shrimp pizza ."
get there early for good seats .
"fast turnaround , and efficient ."
they are all about the business .
the rudeness of the staff totally kills the vibe .
rated due to authentic tastes and styles .
great food and friendly people .
we came for the sashimi dinner .
very well taken care of and prepared well .
the only items worth ordering .
anywhere else in <UNK> will top this place .
real authentic mexican food .
wife is very fussy and loved their shrimp .
not up to hilton standards at all .
maybe saturday at 0:00 is better spent elsewhere .
"not bad , nothing unique ."
this is a perfect example why people shop online .
fresh squeezed orange juice was good .
the taste just takes you to another world .
wo n't be eating that again .
the best tasting fresh oysters in the area .
i thought i was in a <UNK> .
i always had good service here .
the pork belly was the same .
had to throw most of it away .
quality has went down .
"great food , friendly people , good prices ."
what more can you ask ?
they were ready in 0-0 minutes and delicious .
i will come here more often .
complimentary chips and salsa were decent good .
the waitresses here are very friendly .
the food is above average .
the southwest pasta was very good as well .
the food here tastes very fresh .
the fries here are also good .
he seems like a real nice person .
i was able to improve my technique and <UNK> .
it was above average for sangrias in phoenix .
the menu said $ 00 for the <UNK> oscar .
the food poisoning was evident the next day .
the greek salad pizza slice is the bomb !
the slice is full packed of artichokes .
staff and customers here are very friendly and helpful .
i felt like i was on cloud nine .
seems to be a <UNK> college crowd here .
i ' ve been here a few times .
the shrimp dumplings and chicken feet were very good .
food is very good for the money .
the staff here is much friendlier and helpful .
they seem like nice people .
they really take care of you here .
service is top notch .
very friendly and fun .
service was very friendly .
"service was fun , fast , and friendly ."
grilled pork sandwich was very good .
the grilled pork was very tasty .
the bread was great .
i am vietnamese and very picky about vietnamese food .
well none of that was here today .
certainly beats most high fat breakfast options .
"the grilled chicken sandwich was decent , good ."
but even the local walmart here is much friendlier .
"the toppings were scant , almost non-existent ."
ca n't recommend this place for that one reason .
management needs to look into this .
this place misses the mark in comparison .
i tossed and turned a lot .
the food could be much better .
my date ordered the ordered the shrimp plate appetizer .
way overcooked roast beef and it was very dry .
i told the waiter and he took it back .
my date really liked her salad .
she thought it was great .
it took a month to remove the <UNK> .
i called this place and they said 00 minutes .
the soup here is really good .
awesome selection of beer .
the clientele here seems to be 00ish and above .
the food was below par .
the charcuterie was lame .
we went out and head to another place .
the crab legs itself was old .
the service was very good .
maybe the other customers learned their lesson already ?
you can count on that .
a little bland on taste to be honest .
it tasted like a very mild flavored teriyaki bowl .
nice cashier and help staff .
the food above seemed decently healthy .
we had a great time here on friday night .
it was very tasty and delicious .
it looks like a professional job .
the ramen noodles are always soft and soggy .
the pork slices are top rate .
. but to no avail .
my body was complaining violently .
tons of non-asian college age people eating here .
i guess they like it .
my date thought it was great .
overall a good time here .
well this was quite a change of experience .
i had a cold that got worse .
the doctor and staff here probably saved my life .
helped me in making a good selection .
that they have no respect for customers .
it seems this store does not like customers .
i quickly got reminded why i stopped coming .
well why did you put the sign up there .
"well , not here ."
both were lame and were returned .
the roma garden salad was very good .
i also ordered the veal <UNK> .
mediocre dish with mediocre taste .
i can do better at home .
the ambiance and atmosphere is nice .
great lobster rolls and the clam chowder is awesome .
even tho i know thats not nice to say .
i must say i believe this steakhouse is overrated .
it was n't all that great .
a steakhouse out of steak ?
i opted for the baseball cut filet mignon .
will never do business with these rude people again .
very slow ` ` servers ' ' .
cheaper and better than driving to be treated rudely .
otherwise it would have been five stars .
i ' ll go back to midwood .
i delivered pizza to an employee named thomas l .
still the best beer in pittsburgh !
nearly double the wait time .
the mac and cheese was a major disappointment .
certainly not in this dish .
. consistently great food at a fair price .
these vendors match their amazing products with great personalities .
a great option when there are no other options .
mrs thank and mrs <UNK> are amazing instructors .
mrs susan is a great block 0 instructor .
they prepare one to be a healthcare professional .
the food here is absolutely amazing .
the home fries are a must have .
they have a great mixture of new and old .
"lastly , the place is absolutely boring ."
i do n't write many reviews on yelp .
shrimp tempura is bomb .
you ca n't go wrong at this place .
it ' s extremely cramped .
do not eat here .
there are better options .
highly recommend this northern scottsdale gem .
"eclectic , modern , new , and luxurious ."
anything from furnishings to interior design .
service : slow and lacking in <UNK> .
the margherita pizza was unremarkable .
it made me long for a mcdonald ' s .
value : poor at half the price .
"frankly , it would be better without the chicken ."
ambiance : strip mall sushi spot .
crowd : east asian college students taking constant photos .
value : exactly as expected .
ambiance : modern organic .
the dill gin and tonic was almost surprisingly good .
value : appropriately priced .
time : late lunch .
ambiance : 0000s diner .
value : $ 0 tea ?
i have never been a gym type person .
"i was out of shape , with no energy ."
what a great team terry and wendy make .
she ' s very good at massaging .
this place did not disappoint .
that ' s incredible support for the <UNK> .
i got honey walnut shrimp and shrimp pad thai !
nothing tastes good here .
the bulgogi was decent .
that ' s about it .
. the food oh the food .
the steamed pork buns are killer ! ! !
the main reason for the review .
will i fail or succeed ?
always run into someone from back in hawaii here .
ok places to eat .
but the show must go one right .
i ' ve heard about the meatloaf .
they restrooms signs crack me up .
i was here once last summer .
dried up pine leaves ok they were all gone .
pretty much disappointed at the end result .
the refried beans and rice were also very basic .
they did 0 or 0 different hot sauces .
you might notice a few deals for this place .
i ' ll be back for sure .
it was very good and did the spot .
my 0nd to last time went like this .
and what i did i get in return ?
no other place does that .
your food is good but not that good enough .
yea who orders ahead now days ?
solid 0.0 star rating .
best in henderson / green valley sure .
a good relief from the sun .
prices are pretty reasonable also .
"the interior is nice , clean , and welcoming ."
friendly staff with an open view of the kitchen .
anyways do come here cause you wont be disappointed .
i guess my 0 star sounds like being bias .
service is always excellent .
there ' s lots of meat choices .
still the best in town just saying .
nori pieces complemented it all .
fukumimi ramen is n't that hard to find .
it ' s also lighted .
i would come back here more often .
i also did some nigiri .
very nice and creative interior .
drive thru and dine in mexican grill .
back again in less then a week .
usually close to $ 0-0 other places .
my favorite mexican restaurant .
excellent meal while i watched my football .
metro pizza has never served me a bad pizza .
a stuffed pizza on steroids .
maybe it ' s not such a bad thing .
the interior is nice very nice .
they had dim sum served in individual <UNK> .
the leg room on the tables are bad .
you might whack your knees .
located near the entrance of the downtown container park .
yeah i dunno about this place .
but when it arrived i was truly disappointed .
another visit will happen but not anytime soon .
did i enjoy it ?
everything about it was excellent better than the tv .
even the president just had to have some settebello .
really the hug was nothing related to the rating .
waited a long time to get seated .
an then the heat kicked it .
the pork jerky was ok nothing special .
it filled 0 people up .
taste refreshing while it lasted .
multiple levels and located on the strip .
not really a fan of this place .
i was hungry so loaded the grill with everything .
last was buffalo wings for $ 00.00 .
reduced to 0.00 rating .
and parmesan truffle fries $ 0 ?
i live no where even close to one .
this is my liquor candy / toy store .
they even have cigars too .
giant game of chess .
"darts , corn hole , shuffleboard ."
have n't ate there .
korean mexican fusion is an excellent combination .
the have some water things for the kids .
mmm i ' m craving these ribs right now .
will need to try again .
no i ' m only joking .
they seem to have a lot of rules .
the good about oyshi is just about everything else .
http://url service has always been excellent .
food is pretty good .
lol chow mein with chicken was ok .
nothing special but not bad just ok .
but other then that it was good .
the plates could feed 0 maybe 0 families .
just serve up some quality stuff as i remembered .
seat a good numbers of people .
they have a live band that rocked it out .
balcony area overlooking town square .
00 oz <UNK> beer for under $ 0 .
i came in expecting greatness .
its more like in and out nothing flashy .
good ! ? get out of here .
had to try a shake .
small and simple for the price once again .
strip price ! ? maybe .
and sell some fat boy merchandise .
the prices and interior is decent .
wings also take long .
so here it is .
"they ' re good , i enjoy them ."
nothing here is what you would call small .
the lasagna and spaghetti are two other excellent choices .
it ' s basically a shake .
i ' ll be that guy .
this time ribs and outlaw burgers were ordered .
they certainly took their time bringing the ribs out .
i ' ve had way better .
i noticed my ribs were different from the others .
lines for ordering can form out the door .
just go if you like go .
i will surely return and bring others .
ok let ' s do this .
i dunno i was already done and bailed .
make sure you check-in to the right establishment .
i use to walk pass it all the time .
power of yelp brought me here .
i wonder if they ' d fried an egg .
i ' ll be back .
i also enjoyed the pho rare steak and brisket .
their egg rolls are good also .
stopped by before the <UNK> <UNK> .
full bar and great friendly environment .
i probably will install them myself .
what can you not love about the place .
and school some <UNK> .
this place is awesome .
the field area is clean and well maintained .
at least take it out on the <UNK> field .
they are a must here .
lots of cans of napoli tomato sauce .
well this park is cool cause it has everything .
the green <UNK> were also burnt and overcooked .
just invite other people over to your room .
salmon is good but often has bones .
it was a surprisingly a really good 00 oz .
will travel for the good stuff .
the two owners are very cool and friendly people .
nothing really stood out .
it actually got busy after i got there .
then you choose your meats .
then you add various non-meat items .
now they take me here haha .
it was a winner in my book .
they do have food and drink specials .
they are n't cheap but not expensive .
i ' ll most likely be back .
next came what i ordered the bbq brisket sandwich .
maybe the bread took some of the moisture .
busy a lot of times so expect the wait .
does anyone else wan na ?
their brisket melt in your mouth .
i ended up ordering it .
pizza making really is some serious stuff .
i enjoyed the sauce and other ingredients .
have you tried their beef stew ?
it does feel and look like a dirty place .
first i ' ll review <UNK> as a chain .
this location does seem run down .
they could use a renovation .
the must have are the oxtail chili cheese fries .
love the outdoor wooden cabin feel .
it ' s located just south off the strip .
they were very friendly and always checking on us .
so reduced from 0 to 0 .
they have some nice decor .
just ate at a buffet a few hours earlier .
and maps all over the place .
surprisingly there was a lot of dining space .
"they are clean , fast , and reliable ."
oh yea wo fat is goood .
it was ok nothing bad .
http://url all of the items are pretty reasonable priced .
the track is n't difficult .
"the fumes , not well ventilated ."
in environment was good .
some of the equipment are older but <UNK> functional .
i really need a new hobby .
nah maybe next week .
it was topped with fresh onion and <UNK> .
looks like they started to hire some younger people .
it was very good .
order anything and everything you wont leave unsatisfied .
order a full rack of bbq pork ribs .
add them to my list of bbq spots .
plenty of ribs to go around .
as always excellent service on a busy friday night .
i ended up eating the burger in sections .
"they make milkshakes , pizzas , and apps ."
good food and environment .
hopefully the cook makes my burger better next time .
everything else about the night is all a blur .
good service and reasonably priced .
they also have their own rocket fizz bottled sodas .
patiently waited maybe they lost it or something .
tony roma ' s is known for their ribs .
that ' s if you want ribs .
but they also have a pretty good chicken salad .
"quick service , peaceful music , and good pho ."
quick stop at the neighborhood bar .
$ 00 bucket or $ 0 bud and <UNK> .
$ 0.00 <UNK> ' s .
boy was that the life .
http://url talk about money .
luckily i ' ve never had a 0 star .
their bbq sauce is good and can be purchased .
all very cool things .
$ 0 beer and $ 00.00 for ayce wings .
this is a solid 0.0 rating place .
overall it was ok .
ah junk this place .
the grills were easy to use and clean .
the <UNK> and a / c was good .
priced cheaper for what you get .
second their express mentality .
thats about the only difference .
<UNK> ' s is right across desert breeze park .
their pizzas are good .
of course i was just joking about the above .
this review is only for their automotive center .
speciality sushi rolls are all the bomb .
try the salmon skin hand roll its good .
for nigiri all excellent choices .
the carne asada fries was what i went with .
it was too hot to be there earlier .
is it authentic indian ?
ok i ' ll try it .
customer service was ok once we got going .
went with the teriyaki steak teppanyaki .
his flipping skill might need a little work .
he then started making my teriyaki steak dish .
overall a good experience and some good food .
for service they did an excellent job .
goyemon is very good .
nice place for lunches .
soups sandwiches are n't that bad .
lol its their first real sushi bar experience .
rolls were all full rolls no halves .
it is a solid sushi spot .
just go down the list when ordering .
everything was sushi grade .
rolls http://url their rolls are excellent .
- clean and well maintained equipment .
- showers always a plus .
- temperature and environment is set right .
- free weight <UNK> limited to 00 lbs .
its not a motel .
sorry android users with bad batteries .
- no free weight olympic bars .
the sisig was suggested without hesitation .
no one in the group liked it .
as always i like the creativity in the food .
the food is the bomb .
and some <UNK> ocean blue lemonade .
it ' s a popular filipino <UNK> joint .
how would it be when this place is packed ?
i ' ll be back for you fish tacos .
there ' s probably even more ingredients than bread .
now that looked like meal right there .
"service was very good , friendly ."
compared to sahara location this is a big improvement .
order the pastrami burger you wo n't regret it .
the curly fries came seasoned .
00 % off domestic drafts .
i did n't notice a smoke smell .
a number of tvs .
you take another shot then she <UNK> you again .
glass mugs were all up in the air .
drinks are n't cheap and food is reasonably priced .
i had their beers a long time ago .
there ' s free wi-fi and live music .
girl it ' s <UNK> ' me insane .
http://url not as good my dad but still good .
aw damn it <UNK> .
i ' m a fan of the drinks .
do n't steal mine .
it ' s an ok place to eat .
came here again with some co-workers .
the turkey was juicy and good too .
there was ice cream .
yes the food is good .
is the staff awesome ?
i could easily give soho a 0-0 star rating .
it was n't that bad .
spacious but does occasionally fill up .
<UNK> happy <UNK> choke food an <UNK> cheap .
is <UNK> be good huh ?
he <UNK> bacon and sausage link .
lychee or white peach cold sake are $ 0 .
and do n't forget their tostada pizza .
sounds like i ' ll be back soon .
free shot with <UNK> in and review post .
free shot 0 star .
finally something worth having a nevada id for .
you do n't even have to gamble .
pork and beef ribs .
did n't get our drinks until two plates in .
ayce fish and chips friday ' s nights .
expect an update soon and more pictures .
i guess i need to go back tomorrow .
and again another place that only takes cash really .
they have lots of different omelets and sandwiches .
"more relaxing environment then albertson , smith , vons ."
"good selection of seafood , meat , and beer ."
their ate some good eats around the area also .
and their usually accommodating for groups .
best buffet i been to under $ 00 .
especially if you see what you get .
we tend to eat plates of them .
is it monday yet .
a few in the group ordered some calzones .
maybe i ' ll be back for these .
it was enjoyable but not great .
two words ` ` <UNK> nights ' ' .
so much food i was full half way through .
i think they are doing an excellent job here .
"talk about a food <UNK> , <UNK> ."
the chips and <UNK> dessert were enjoyable .
enjoyed them the most .
they do have a drive thru .
would ' ve been one hell of a mess .
well good news monta fans .
this and the ribs were my favorite items here .
service for some reason has always been slow .
everything else was maybe a 0-0 .
overall a 0.00 rating .
ah jackson ' s bar and grill .
prime rib is offered pretty much everywhere in town .
the rest of menu ai n't that bad .
the corned beef hash http://url was pretty good too .
same center as ross j ' s aloha grill .
which might be a good deal .
i ' ll be back soon definitely .
it was like an over sized slider .
thin fries with truffle cheese and truffle salt .
i knew i was in trouble here .
the interior is nice and clean .
yonaka is good very good .
nice interior and excellent service and very friendly staff .
guacamole and sour cream was extra .
they have a good nightly special from 0-0 pm .

<UNK> attitude as thick as their mindless skulls .
i spoke up and was shown to a booth .

great service and food .
clean and cleverly decorated .

the staff is very friendly and professional .
<UNK> my search brought up two scottsdale locations .

give that place a try .
one of my favorite places in phx .
great food and on the way home .
burgers and 0 dollars drinks .
the miso cod was excellent as well .
i had the braised lamb .

another issue was that my server was constantly behind .
there is no restaurant on site .
great service and price .
the completed job surpassed my wildest expectations .
a little smokey but not too bad .
if you are a wing fan get them !

let me start by saying the food was awesome .
just went their for the late night meal .
come here every time i ' m in vegas .
made to order all you can eat sushi .
i had much better wings in other places .
i thing most of the wings was over cooked .
good late night place .
hair cuts for guys was only $ 0 bucks .
online portal for payments works well .
the dj was killing it ! ! dj vice .
best poutine experience of my life hands down .

"first , the price ."
will definitely use these guys again .
thanks for making my bachelor party a memorable one .

the third course was excellent .
"all in all , it was an okay experience ."
i would recommend the black and blue burger .
the beer is cold and cheap enough .
what else do you need to know ?
stop reading this and go to <UNK> now !
i see why <UNK> did a segment on them .
roy hits a <UNK> with his menu .
called mike on sunday around 00am .
it was the main board .
the unit drain upstairs was clogged .
went here for a business dinner tonight .
what a fool i was .
especially when the price and quality are top-notch .
i grew up in northwest indiana .
"in my opinion , edc does everything right ."
it came with sweet potato tater tots .
highly recommend this place .
great restaurant inside a converted church .
apparently you are punished for using this deal .
they slammed the dumpster lids multiple times .
we were looking forward to enjoying the lazy river .
there were about 0 bus loads of kids there .

clean and friendly staff .
keep up the good work guys .
0 - clean nice environment .

mold and mildew in the hotel rooms .
food is good too .
worth a visit if your in the area !
the service is top notch and very friendly !
i agree with some of the other comments .
i am a 00 + year hertz gold member .
the counter staff tried some ham handed upselling .
the rule seems to be buyer beware .
in this case i screwed up by trusting them .
elegant setting and best views of vegas .
best part hands down was the service .
this place has good burgers on the strip .
nothing compares to schwartz ' s in smoked meat .
"and , be ready for a line up outside ."
this is a really good place .
sadly the place closed .
its was the never same with the new owners .
0.0 to 0 stars .
the manager never came back to the table again .
hope this helps ... hope the casino reads this .
great food but terrible service .
good italian restaurant in montreal .
they offer lemon chicken wings which are really good .
good service ... good place to eat !
this a good place to eat a grill lobster .
the portion are big and good quality .
they were out of 0 other beers .
the pizza crust was doughy .
the toppings sparse and as tasteless as the sauce .
nice clean place with good food .
go to il <UNK> instead .
"huh , huh , huh ."
too many other great choices in vegas .
but the food makes up for it .
carnevino and cut do this too .
and keep the soy <UNK> in the kitchen .
you ca n't go wrong with any burger .
"of course , get it medium rare or rare ."
it ' s the same menu .
carnevino and cut are in a league their own .
nothing is left to chance .
everything is done deliberately .
but the quality apparently can not be beat .
the service is flawless .
bring your third mortgage .
but it just may be worth it .
think ` ` ihop on steroids .
do n't expect spago .
patio bar is the place to sit .
look forward to coming back on my next visit .
"excellent sandwiches , great service ."
the starters are very lackluster however .
the salami was also very very lightly seasoned .
do n't make a mistake when ordering through <UNK> .
we tell her what we want .
"a clean , well lighted place for coffee ."
"outstanding food , fresh and delicious ."
phoenix is desperate for more restaurants such as this .
<UNK> the drive from any part of the valley .
that back entrance was an adventure by itself .
the alcohol was expensive as well .
it ' s been consistent over the years .
but i still like it in a hurry .
good 0 : amazing food .
good 0 : consistency .
this place does n't fail .

this is the morton ' s of burgers .
all top notch and professional .
they bring in some of the best talent .

"the place kills it , absolutely kills it ."
good 0 : the food .

this place is a joke .
everything seemed good at this point ... then ... .
completely unprofessional and reckless .
the pizza is decent and the staff is friendly .
this was not a thick stew .
the koobideh was about 0â 0/0 to 0x larger .
the <UNK> <UNK> was very good .
the kabobs are just that delicious .
0 minutes went by .
that ' s a good sign .
seems he changed and was leaving for the day .
do n't mistake this feta for greek feta .
so why the poor rating ?
but that ' s for another review .
so now back to the <UNK> clay pot .
took an hour to get delivered .
highly encourage anyone to avoid this <UNK> .
even the delivery guy was a dick .
try the greek fries with your sandwich or gyro .
they could care less about your dining experience .
the 0 other places are incredibly popular .
. witness most of these current reviews .
pamela ' s is unique .
their hash browns are very different as well .
almost creamy in texture .
see the day and evening shows .
actually 0.0 ! ! ! very average chinese food .
the food is terrible and way overpriced .
"total discrimination , find a better place ."
jonathan is an expert in customer service .
excellent food and service every time .
had another great meal at chop shop today .
had an awesome chicken pita here yesterday .
"great prices , great service and always awesome food ."
pizza is out of this world .
their internal communication between departments is bad .
as for clear for home wireless - avoid it .
after that it needed a check .
"the problem is , they are n't always there ."
i contacted nissan corp for this region and appealed .
have n't met more honest repair people .
these guys on the other hand were really impressive .
so i called these guys .
atmosphere and ambiance was what i expected .
instead it was very lack of warmth .
our <UNK> had 0 ribeyes and a top sirloin .
to say they are grossly incompetent is an understatement .
they are killing your business reputation .
we almost immediately started seeing a negative effect .
the above was n't even the worst .
that is a child development no-no .
ca n't change what i overheard unfortunately .
again showed up unprepared with a wrong programmed router .
again flaky internet service .
"unprofessional cooking skills , very loud music ."
tip - free parking in their lot around back .
they made it sound like the perfect sandwich .
what ' s not to like about that ?
the meat was n't bad .
an <UNK> hamburger patty .
i ' ll leave it at that .
we also order two pittsburgh beers .
they even have ones for your dog .
the salmon tasted fresh .
everything from the beginning to the end was fantastic .
and it ai n't just ` coffee ' anymore .
it runs until midnight .
i recommend this place .
very friendly service and authentic south indian food .
i went there with my office colleagues for lunch .
they have pretty standard fare .
but not to try authentic indian cuisine .
"the room was simply decorated , but very clean ."
how about the nice spacious bathroom ?
this could be an annoying issue .
"all in all , a great option for vegas ."
"an <UNK> , to set the evening off ."
"when they entered orders , i got pushed on ."
i found the worst service restaurant in az . .
the app came out minutes before lunch .
i ' m such and idiot .
"well , that insurance sucks too ."
nice guys do get screwed .
they have expanded tremendously .
this is where i do all of my banking .
finally my last problem was the timing .
food is good but their advertisement is false .
when he rings it up it was 0.00 .
their chips and salsa are delicious and bottomless .
it packs a real punch .
you ca n't go wrong with this incredible deal .
their shredded beef and chicken tacos are excellent .
now i find that very hard to believe .
this place is amazing .
other than that is was a great experience .
i always have an excellent experience at this chipotle .
but they always have a back-up ready immediately .
this one does n't have self checkout lines .
- rrb - this park is nice .
i have the passport and i get unlimited washes .
had some local beer for me to try out .
for the money garbage .
i have been here four time .
mediocre meat for the money .
last two time cool steak when served .
but the service at this particular place was outstanding .
<UNK> at its top form .
good taste nice stuff good location .
great place to have a nice meal at lunch .
i would n't call this casual .
lots of suits for lunchtime .
the food quality was fantastic .
brewery built elegantly into the church .
come here for the view if nothing else .
the food is n't bad either .
way better than bar food .
really good burgers and milkshakes - simple .
"good burgers are good , enough said ."
"the perfect combination of food , beer and atmosphere ."
they serve beer by the liter .
want to get a seat ?
"now , onto the food ."
the fries and chicken were average .
it ' s a must order .
i preferred the ronin .
nothing special to say about the appetizer .
the <UNK> <UNK> was their traditional combo of toppings .
the line moves surprisingly quick imo .
this burger has it .
pork is very tender .
fire roasted veal chop - this is my fav !
staff and service are always top notch .
beverages are constantly refilled .
food is always solid .
price is not unreasonable .
i ' m a huge fan of ichiza .
"good , but not great ."
one person can not finish this .
"in fact , three people can not finish this ."
food came out at a good pace .
the menu is short and to the point .
my friends had the same without the gravy .
$ 00 gets you entry with some warm clothes .
the wait we were told was still an hour .
"ummm , not sure ` bout that ."
stews were not properly warmed up & served cold .
to salty & soggy on the stews as well .
fry bread is good but it could be better .
miss the old bill johnson ' s .
pizza crust & toppings are excellent .
dis place is closed .
keep in mind this establishment is a walk-up order .
egg drop soup & spring rolls are excellent .
egg drop soup are awesome .
fried green tomatoes is excellent .
top sirloin 0oz prime & salmon oscar are excellent .
the taste is in the meat not the sauce .
typical excuse in my book .
you can feel this place has history .
"very clean establishment , the food was excellent ."
defintely will be back for some more great food .
by looking at it looks fresh & it is .
the taste of beef is tasty .
miss the old menu .
bring back the old menu .
this place is not the same anymore .
i would n't recommended it .
<UNK> need to improve <UNK> service .
did n't really care for bbq beef brisket sandwich .
my wife and i went here tonight .
they advertised crab and shrimp but there was none .
never got a call back to discuss .
the tailoring made the clothes look and feel great .
do they not have enough dishes ?
"please lighten up , fame waitstaff ."
"especially breakfast , which is excellent ."
and i never got a second cup of coffee .
want a great casino experience ?
i first went to lb in may of 0000 .
the staff is exceptional .
he said to drop the car for an estimate .
i think just brakes tore them !
the short ribs are great !
this place was awesome .
little pricey but it was worth it .
the food was largely bland and unimaginative .
pepper relish sets it off .
ask for dave he will take care of ya !
the staff is very nice for starters .
they are those twice fried french fries .
the goat cheese appetizer is amazing .
but you cant go wrong with the rest .
my brand new board broke .
amazing ! ! ! chorizo hash is great .
the bacon waffles are also great .
four strips of bacon mixed in a waffle .
do not let the strip mall scare you .
the prime ribeye was over cooked and flavor less .
overall just a extremely shady operation .
the line looks long but it moves .
they are pretty damn consistent in high quality .
the griddled cheese is excellent for a quick bite .
the food is fantastic .
"and so very , very reasonable for the quality ."
most dinner or lunch entrees are $ 0.00 .
"and , besides , this is madison ."
who cares about who you sleep with ?
<UNK> beans and <UNK> is awesome .
my wife loves the <UNK> and <UNK> .
specifically david <UNK> and kevin <UNK> .
these two are a piece of work .
talk about getting f * <UNK> !
never have i dealt with shady people like that .
it ' s ok i guess .
very impressed with the show .
best kalbi ribs in da valley .
the dealers are real nice and friendly .
new to fountain hills .
we ordered a caesar salad that was quite good .
this place is way overpriced .
"light , crispy , and cooked very well ."
this is where things started to go downhill fast .
this place is awesome .
the cowboy burger and hangover burger are amazing .
the salmon nothing special .
the few pluses : good local draft beers .
great cozy coffee shop .
outside could use some work though .
i will be going back .
the food has no taste .
if you like tasty food please go somewhere else .
i think we found our new mexican restaurant home .
definitely worth the drive away from the overpriced strip .
"had brunch , huevos ranchero was good ."
what they did screw up was the price .
high priced for what it is .
chips were also stale .
i highly recommend baker ' s bikes .
"overpriced , over seasoned , over salted food ."
"nice atmosphere and concept , poorly executed ."
just enough heat to get your attention .
where have you been all of my life ?
maybe i ordered the wrong dishes .
"this year , we chose cowboy ciao ."
our waiter ` ` dan ' ' was great .
we asked more questions than the average couple .
he had no problem answering and being attentive .
the strawberry velvet cake was awesome as well .
the <UNK> pasta ... excellent .
this is as good as it gets !
dealers and pit bosses were friendly and entertaining .
all theatres reclining seats and are stadium seating style .
they serve good food here at regal .
no complaints from either of us .
service is pretty good .
and some pretty cool guitars too .
i ' ve heard good things .
drive past their shipping area and hang a right .
no problems at all .
this place is very simple .
plenty of places to park .
sahara was really cool .
sits between the mgm sportsbook and studio 00 .
you can also walk to the strip from here .
<UNK> also gave off a good amount of pressure .
overall i had a good experience .
and again this one is well kept .
kind of tastes like water .
so it may take a few minutes .
"other than that , check in was pretty smooth ."
room is approximately 000 square feet .
- rrb - casino floor is huge !
the sportsbook is live as well .
got a great rate .
. so that was the easy part .
casino : the casino is huge .
any game you want they pretty much have .
the sportsbook was pretty cool too .
the place is swarming with bums .
their gyro ' s are very large and <UNK> .
that first day was a tragic experience .
the sushi was actually very good and reasonably priced .
it was very tender and flavorful .
the owner is very friendly and hard working .
everything about the meal was excellent .
this will not deter me from going here again .
the car was clean and it looked good .
i feel it is a scam .
i had 00 in a 0 year period .
"outstanding , had 0 different servers waiting on us ."
"great service , outstanding food ."
best meal in 0 days in vegas .
was not that cheap .
however the beers cold and delicious .
avoid this place at all costs !
"he was courteous , knowledgeable , and attentive ."
the service department at big two is amazing .
this is our favorite italian restaurant in the valley .
good food and fast service .
it was a tire manufacture issue .
excellent food and a very good price .
i honestly believe the best part was the beginning .
was there on sat .
highly recommend this show .
medieval time is 000x times better .
the acting was terrible .
not as bad as people make it seem .
this was the <UNK> sound choice for me .
the room was as advertised .
he quotes me a time of 00min - 0hr .
btw the sensor was $ 000 dollars .
its wal-mart not really that great of a place .
the gyro meat is n't that great here .
awesome birthday dinner with the wife !
simply the best greek food in vegas .
best fish in vegas offering all you can eat .
they care about offering a top product .
"bread came out first , some ok baked rolls ."
"the next course , caesar salad was good ."
the main course came next .
the wife had the mediterranean chicken pasta .
we also liked the low limit gambling downstairs .
the taste was less than good .
the place is not good at all .
the service is pretty bad too .
this place is pretty damn good .
i love taking my son and wife here .
service is also great .
do n't like this place at all .
they are over priced and over crowded .
it is the best pizza i have had .
i would recommend the sicilian with everything .
this is the best breakfast spot .
ends up they do n't price match with <UNK> .
had some great udon and loco moco .
these guys have the lowest prices in the valley .
that was in june of 0000 .
. the rooms were very nicely updated and modern .
"i ' d recommend this hotel anyone , bus ."
and the pizza is pretty good too .
i ate their reuben .
had a local deli feel which is nice .
the place is cool .
it ' s an old bank .
this chuck e . cheese is absolutely horrible .
the service is slow at best .
this facet is the absolute worst restaurant concept ever .
the result is absurdly long line times .
the pizza was excellent .
cut in squares as it should be .
i ' ll be back .
and they constantly lie about having made deliveries .
not worth the risk .
and why put mussels in a freezer anyway ?
the normally awesome bbq ribs were leather .
the buffet is huge with easily 000 selections .
food is always excellent .
i ordered the steak frites medium rare .
my wife had ordered the lobster chili rellenos .
why they call them rellenos is beyond me .
unfortunately that all ended a couple of months ago .
they only had 0 guys working the sushi bar .
simply ca n't be done .
my wife and i went there again last week .
"should be ok , i thought ."
the first plate took over 00 minutes .
can ninja be fixed ?
i think they need to drain them better .
pretty average although the portion was more than generous .
had the beef carpaccio as an app .
the water boiled fish is also phenomenal .
extremely easy ordering system .
good move on my part .
"quick summary : great food , lousy service ."
i filled out survey and that ' s why .
they make this work .
corp stuff is easy to ignore .
cole slaw instead of sauerkraut .
very little thousand island dressing .
"marble bread , not a strong rye flavor ."
corned beef was bland too .
i ' m also irish .
service is mostly good .
the decor was extremely ny .
after two hours the food still had n't arrived .
took in the mac king comedy magic show recently .
this place is a real bbq treat .
i made the mistake of buying the all-day pass .
$ 00.00 to eat pieces of shit .
literally like eating pieces of shit .
this place is great .
as legit as you can get .
i ' ll be back .
hands down best greek joint in the neighborhood .
kelly in appliances treated my wife like a queen !
other than that ... great pizza .
"great staff , clean , safe ."
i highly recommend it old or young .
this place is awesome .
everytime i eat there the food is perfect .
the gyro ... perfect .
i highly recommended it .
the garlic balls are awesome .
also the mushrooms are terrific .
the plumber came out to install a water softener .
i highly recommend this jiffy lube .
good neighborhood chinese food .
"also , put new carpet in the rooms ."
they are very professional and price is very reasonable .
price is very comparable with larger flooring co . .
this is the place to shop .
the first night i had the veal special .
it was seasoned perfectly and nicely presented .
the second night i had the <UNK> beef .
it was very tender with a flavorful wine sauce .
tempe police is a horrible establishment true and through .
wine list was very good .
this place should not be rushed .
service was very good .
the meal was average for the price .
friend had a bbq hamburger that looked great .
great place for a cheap movie .
you will see trash and broken seats on occasion .
great place to get good meat .
best part this amazing place is all free !
good place to go down town .
and the fact my family was sold on burgers .
also cool they have it on saturday .
"tasty , but overpriced ."
so i got a triple .
with a lot of stuff on it .
i was looking forward to this monstrosity .
the food came out relatively quickly .
"but , i almost had difficulties finishing it ."
so it was time to get out of here .
"big , airy store ."
maybe just a highlight of the new stuff ?
that seemed to really hold true on sunday .
gps ca n't even save you from this bs .
this place is a pretty big stand-alone casino .
"they have 0 entrances , and a few restaurants ."
did i get dirty looks ?
"approaching the place , it looks huge ."
but they still worked well .
"yes , it sits on a busy corner ."
where was men ' s ?
"wow , that ' s all ?"
"i <UNK> , and walked ."
that was a great experience as well .
"thanks for the turn around , nm !"
the food came out hot as well .
i could see this place easily getting slammed !
"upon entering , you go up to a window ."
maybe they like it rough .
i even got my ass kicked in pool .
the cheapest tab i ever had !
it looked as good as the place smelled .
and it left me full as hell .
that is all i needed to hear .
"i mean , wow ."
that was a 0 star affair .
"however , the dining area is somewhat small ."
just ignore this paragraph .
i also got some more beer .
i regret not putting more sauce on mine .
then pick a spot and enjoy .
and it has been open for 00 years .
especially on opening day .
thankfully it was al ' s beef .
they could care less about the lighter .
the next thing i realized is the location .
"no wine , beer , or even ice ."
the <UNK> apple pie moonshine .
the dining room - a decent size .
the drink machine - served coke !
"thankfully , that was not the case here ."
"thankfully , it was empty ."
the food then came out .
i washed it down with the other sandwich .
like they had a <UNK> for it .
"a few moments later , the philly came out ."
now here is the interesting thing .
thankfully the place was clean .
i unfortunately had to deal with grant .
i probably should have had that done alot sooner .
"still good though , yeah , still good ."
right outta the gate .
and $ 0.00 for domestic beers ... .
and the staff are attentive and very courteous .
definitely a must see .
"big place , good food , and not expensive ."
"i had the verde burrito , soooooo good ."
well that was easy .
and you figure the employee would have 0 .
an italian menu inspired restaurant with some great specials .
i do n't know what it was .
well at least buffalo wild wings .
friendly atmosphere and open 00/0 .
the part that throws me off is the price .
anymore manly than that ?
a steak and a cigar .
just half ... enjoy .
all good people and want to make you smile .
guess they proved that guy wrong .
but that ' s for another review .
not a whole lot else here .
after that these guys were super cool .
' ' cause this place does that .
otherwise everything was good .
<UNK> the sim card port is torn .
the service was fast and the price was right .
too much up selling .
kids in blue shirts work slow and lazy .
all in all i found their services excellent .
best hotdogs in phoenix .
favorite curry is the 0 color curry .
the ravioli ' s disappeared like magic .
the only negative was the taco .
there ' s lots of seating and full bar .
this is a great spot for lunch .
they have a really good selection of iced tea .
flavors are dead on .
another great south blvd . ethnic restaurant .
this place is outstanding every time .
"and the room , absolutely perfect ."
before leaving i spoke with the manager tony .
i visit once or twice a month .
they saw no reason i should need a hotel .
the chicken was well cooked and juicy .
good stuff - i ' d be back .

and the first one was legacy air .
that ca n't be true .
"this place , i have to try ."
that one sounds interesting .

"if you have n't tried it , try it ."
service is great and quick .
the food is a true masterpiece of mexican .

the tv in the room is outdated .

this place has great ambiance too .
yelp led us here .
the wine pairings are competent .
the service is helpful and not intrusive .

"creative , interesting restaurant , though not perfect ."
seating in small rooms creates intimate feeling .
dominated by the cheese .
paired well with <UNK> <UNK> blanc .
noodles with morels and <UNK> <UNK> : delicious .
paired with <UNK> <UNK> pinot noir .
"an odd pairing , but actually worked ."

keep up the good work <UNK> bros !

he is always smiling and is a great guy !
do be prepared for a wait .
the end result is well worth the wait .
for $ 0.00 that ' s pretty unacceptable .
they bring you more drinks and cigars .
they make you feel welcome .
"it a great place , go here now ."
this place is great .
a great place for ramen .
the broth is very good .

carne asada fries a must .
it was a great bottled beer .
so i ordered several to wash down the food .
"well , they just lost a customer ."
i am not a big sub sandwich eater .
<UNK> facilities are rated at <UNK> levels .
my <UNK> in tempe is a gold level .
you must pay more to visit an <UNK> facility .
i needed my workout today though .
the equipment is much better and newer in scottsdale .
equipment : there was a good variety of machines .
those are extra little bonuses not offered in tempe .
i do n't know what else to say .
and the margaritas are pretty damn good too .
"price wise , it is very inexpensive ."
best bang for the buck sushi .
"nice atmosphere , the tonkatsu ramen was very good ."
thats a good sign that the food is authentic .
prime rib here is the best !
00 oz for 00 bucks .
the service and the presentation were great .
"the food was really only so-so , imho ."
nice hotel about 0 miles south of strip .
taxi ride about $ 00 to main strip .
do n't go there expecting a fine dining experience .
this place is different .
you cant help but have a great time .
short line compared to the strip .
service is always on point .
0.0 hours to get a wire transfer ?
stayed at the palms last weekend .
not bad at only 0 bucks / hour .
the kids quest place is awesome .
the rooms were really nice .
its a great place for the family .
gambling here is ok .
the shortrib was amazing as was the soufflã © .
i tried 0 drinks here .
a must visit when near phoenix .
great service and nice people .

went there for the first time today .
nice lady at counter ; good and fast service .
no one showed up at the airport .
i ' ll make it simple .
would have given less stars if food was worse .
i had such high hopes .
artichoke and gorgonzola everywhere .
not only the seams fell apart .
"for the price , this is a good option ."
very large shop with lots of seating .
"lunch prices are reasonable , but dinner is pricey ."
best coffee in montreal .
"awesome pizza , lots of topping ."
"fresh pita , and great texture to the rice !"
aloha - <UNK> your ono <UNK> !
loved the fried chicken and pot stickers !
the meal came out in a timely fashion .
"the portions were great , the food was incredible ."
the hostesses were friendly and genuinely gracious .
imagine down home cooking with an upscale flair .
perhaps it was a new chef ?
i tasted my gravy and agreed .
the place was very clean as well .
it lived up to my expectations .
"the staff is friendly , smiling as you enter ."
the cherry on top was the price .
"karaoke , <UNK> underwater art <UNK> ."
the crown which they rightfully hold is well deserved !
your taste buds will thank you for trying this .
this place is amazing .
all the sides are fantastic too .

"mr . wynn , are you aware of this ?"
this was / is a deal breaker .
the salsas were quite good .
excellent prime rib special on tuesdays as well .
after the third time it became comical .
that ' s hardly an excuse .
i go in for the bills games .
great white <UNK> if you are into those .
i recommend half bbq and half buffalo chicken pizza .
great variety of craft beer .
low price from batting cages to team enter fees .

i will be craving the guru burger for weeks .
you have that option of cooking in your suite .
i called there 000 number and waited 00 minutes .
she ca n't match or give us the rate .
this place can shove it in this economy .
word of advise to the owners .
even yelp has a cheaper rate .
the hotdogs are n't bad either .
the foie gras app was also good .
either of these two restaurants will make your night .
definitely no comparison to my first visit here .
the hot fresh bread is a must .
the meat balls are the best i ever had .
ca n't say enough good things .
have gotten better ones outside of steakhouses .
felt like i was in an overly decorated <UNK> .
decided to go somewhere else without taking another cab .
absolutely the best steakhouse in las vegas .
not a very good birthday present .
absolutely the best sushi in vegas .
top quality seafood at very reasonable prices .
the bao bun tastes like a pork burger .
"i walk in , empty ."
super bomb huge pizza slices .
authentic italian history lessons accompany each meal .
service is always on point .
but then again nothing that makes it stand out .
another dude comes out and makes my food .
pancakes were dryer than the base of mount charleston .
they did offer a military discount .
that brought them from 0 star to two .
not stoked at all especially after the build up .
there are some great qualities and a couple annoyances .
there ' s a pinball game for everyone .
"<UNK> , south park , batman ."
<UNK> <UNK> at the golden corral .
they also get great fatty points for the horchata .
i am the quintessential fat asian nerd .

oh wait there ' s more .
"so thank you , e flamingo <UNK> team !"
it is probably the best sports bar in town .
this dude really knows his stuff .
i am a regular here .
will remain for some time .
"sweet and spicy caribbean flavors , cooked to perfection ."
"<UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> ."
ambiance : below average .
i ' m done with that .
the bartender was also the waitress .
the <UNK> are a bunch of assholes .
i ' m done with that .
as good as it gets .
nothing to complain about here .
the quality of the meat is not comparable .
it is very high quality .
"great hotel , i be back for sure ."
favorite asian cuisine in oakland .
the food exceeded my expectations .

it was a nice modern style restaurant .
the chicken that i sample was completely moist .
a nice vacation destination .

it simply was not worth it .
decent chicago italian beef sandwich .

sandwich was hard as a rock .
very disappointing compared to california ' s lee sandwiches .
0 - rrb - no children ' s menu .

the nicest people i have ever met buying tires .
"god , i miss panera bread ."
"that said , this place is a distant second ."
it ' s soups and salads are very good .

the idea of this place is great .
it ' s your typical sports bar restaurant .
it ' s extremely loud .

overall a great place and has been for years .
it ' s a gay meat market .
it ' s oversold by about 0000 members .
the equipment is ok ... when it is available .

it really is amazing thats all i can say .
- rrb - but very good .
- great tapas and cocktails at great prices .
- smoke free enviroment .
had a sausage and mushroom .
this is my go-to burger place in las vegas .
prices are reasonable and the food is excellent .
the food is fresh made and seems authentic .
the issue i had was with the steak itself .
this is where cut falls short .
it is a travesty to do this .
"overall , the restaurant is great ."
the steaks however left a lot to be desired .
i settled on the mexican mole stout .
my wife enjoyed the <UNK> very much .
the table was also dirty .
my only drawback is their merry xmas stickers .
maintenance is <UNK> and professional .
does it get any better ?
i got the steak and eggs .
eggs were from a powdered mix .
potatoes were the only saving grace .
"service was polite , attentive , and prompt ."
then i looked it up .
it leaves from union station .
their stop is conveniently located above parking .
from vegas it leaves from the south strip terminal .
"center strip , behind the flamingo ."
walk through the flamingo to be with the action .
front rows get splashed .

the worst experience getting take out .
i ca n't order a neck from fender ?
maybe you need new it people .
excellent food and friendly owners .
showers and laundry are nice .
a friend of mine suggested i try this place .
this place needs major health dept inspections .
chinese buffets usually deserve 0 to 0 stars .
this place rocks in almost every way .
the only thing lacking is the interior decorating .
the staff is just totally disorganized and unprofessional .
surprised this place reopened and is still in business !
this is the real deal folks .
hiro sushi is my new go-to .
consistency is key and ten does n't have it .
"strangely , america west bought out us airways ."
the <UNK> dinner is a best bet .
to some this is a real az hangout .
order any other food at your own discretion !
everything is fresh and very high quality .
one of the best <UNK> ethnic restaurants in phoenix .
exceptional local carefree / cave creek / n .
old location was great and had character .
this place is a hidden <UNK> .
the steaks were ... no exaggeration ... sizzler quality .
sushi ` ` <UNK> ' ' will look elsewhere .
you just wo n't leave overwhelmed with excitement .
the food is mediocre and the atmosphere quite blah .
everything went downhill from there .
think <UNK> with a twist .
this is no exception .
"quite simply , the best ."
the main problem i have is the price .
probably the most comprehensive chinese menu in the valley .
room : the room was extremely clean and modern .
trams take no more than 00 minutes to arrive .
the sweet creamed corn is also highly recommended .
this man is a consummate professional .
it was flat out awful .
i believe it has an excellent wine cellar .
my wife enjoyed her smoked meat sandwich .
<UNK> the okra dish was above average .
a visit here is a great experience .
their origins go back to 0000 .
hit the spot pretty well .
a nice place with an all-around good menu .
the pork souvlaki platter holds up well under <UNK> .
this place is not worth what they charge .
service is brisk but friendly .
"the food made it well worth it , however ."
i have n't had anything bad there .
but they are very nice people .
"other than that , it was rather enjoyable ."
perhaps it ' s the high ceilings .
you ' ll be glad you did .
"smashburger , burger king , and lenny ' s ."
the food was amazing .
so i was a great cook that night .
"great appetizers , and food ."
"but hey , that ' s just my thoughts ."
quite possibly the world ' s best coffee !
ask a staff member .
another five to six minutes go by .
"by this time , about fifteen minutes pass ."
"serranos at rural , this is strike one ."
you have two left .
coulda used more beef in the beef flank .
. authentic middle eastern cuisine made from scratch .
it ' s all in the flavor .
stuffed <UNK> game <UNK> .
pretty ordinary for an buffet .
the vip martini is excellent - pineapple infused vodka .
<UNK> theme taco place with different style .
"very tasty , excellent service and presentation ."
great service and exceptional food .
i recommend the deep fried deviled eggs .
one of my favorite korean places on campus .
a nice addition to downtown champaign .
and the owner and his family are great folks .
the miso soup is perfectly prepared .
brisket is a specialty .
"sauce can be ordered hot , mild or mixed ."
the office is permanently closed .
so we know and respect good asian food .
what is this place ?
they clearly hired all <UNK> young women as waitstaff .
my date and i split two entrees for lunch .
the topper was an iced tea for $ 0.00 .
this place is an american dream .
get the gyro omelet .
breakfast any time of day .
"<UNK> opened on tuesday , september 0 , 0000 ."
"excellent , with a nice kick to it ."
"greasy , but good taste and crunchy thick crust ."
see the photo i posted .
ask and you shall receive .
i suggest you look at the filtered reviews .
the free salsa is excellent .
the beer selection is good .
overpriced and nothing special .
it does n't need mexican names to be understood .
that ca n't be good ... see the photo .
"<UNK> opened on friday , may 00 , 0000 ."
it ' s really surprisingly good .
bibimbap in a hot stone bowl was excellent .
that was the most dominant feature of the restaurant .
on so many levels that was wrong .
cash <UNK> get a 0 % discount .
no tipping is allowed or expected .
the lunch served was excellent and unique .
there are many good <UNK> in cu .
"on this date at least , michaels was great ."
went for breakfast twice while staying at mgm .
good amount of food for your dollar .
wait staff friendly and prompt .
this goes on the skip it list .
the food is good also .
you will find something here to satisfy you .
just good decent selection of a <UNK> favorites .
stop by and enjoy the adventure .
this is fine dining at its best .
the tonkatsu was average with slightly overly salty sauce .
the service here definitely deserves mentioning .
great service and attitude .
overall a very pleasing choice .
nothing short of great in that department .
it ' s burger king !
this place always blows them away .
the wise guy pizza is not to be missed .
"great place , great food ."
"it is that good , absolutely amazing ."
on to the food .
"for me , it is all about the broth ."
it really shows in the pho .
<UNK> ' s chicken pho has her hooked .
but do n't stop there .
the egg rolls are also very tasty .
all hail king richard and his excellent culinary skills .
how do you get excited about a dinner salad ?
this place has really gone down hill .
overpriced crappy service played out restaurant .
waiter came by table one time .
joke for nice place .
food is pretty good .
the place was very loud .
great service great drinks .
zoyo is the best <UNK> ever .
these are the best things ever .
pluses : nada damn thing .
"chips and salsa : standard , slightly greasy chips ."
tomato based salsa with not much flavor or heat .
cheese enchilada : overcooked tough and crispy tortilla .
value for the money : non-existent .
$ 00 for the combo and i left hungry .
the staff is professional and attentive .
the turkey is roasted fresh daily .
they put subway and quizno ' s to shame .
this time i have just one recommendation .
"good food , great price !"
fun retro vintage atmosphere and great pizza and beer .
worst pizza i ' ve ever had .
but overall <UNK> is well placed .
and it works flawlessly .
you even get a discount for multiple tanks .
not a bad thing just a surprise .
food came in about 00 minutes .
meat lovers scramble was good with crisp hash browns .
service was fine and appropriately attentive .
super excellent detailing to perfection !
his service throughout the night was unparalleled .
it is just fantastic .
the flavor was lacking and bland .
what a waste of a $ 000 k vehicle .
old and dirty rooms .
tv has sd <UNK> channels .
pool looks nothing like their site .
i agree with the reviews on this place .
delicious and authentic venezuelan fare .
i would highly recommend a visit .
highly disappointed with the fare after a recent visit .
"it was great , nicely cooked ."
only the owner speaks and understands english well .
the food quality has decline drastically .
- rrb - try hickory tavern .
food is better and the people are great .
this is a great place .
dino and charles are the best .
the food alone is enough to come for .
start your day right by coming here .
avoid like the plague !
price is also very good .
got help here for our wedding in las vegas .
the food was also very good .
glad to see <UNK> ' s back in business .
still ... the food is great .
then go gamble more .
just hire a mechanic and give him a budget .
great place to take kids .
i hope they <UNK> in furniture and facilities soon .
can you say <UNK> coffee shop in downtown chandler ?
"great food , great atmosphere at this place ."
over all very pleased with this dealership .
i find some of the reviews on here funny .
a licensed honda mechanic is diagnosing it .
of course auto zone does n't charge .
the food was amazing .
did n't make much of a difference .
i ' ll be back .
the restaurant layout itself was ok at best .
plus i make an effort supporting small business .
the large windows let in a lot of light .
"service wise , never had an issue ."
not worth the extra cost .
glad i discovered this place .
the brussel sprouts were superb .
both the food and service was excellent .
we did n't see a manager on premises .
do n't go to sb .
this place had the worst food ever .
it ' s a really great dive bar .
"was a walking , living , breathing commercial ."
i had the bleu burger .
maybe the best burger i have had out .
my wife ordered the spicy chicken salad .
so i trusted him and boy it was good .
in summary : very good food .
what is wrong with las vegas ?
this place should be full on a saturday night .
the quality has gone down since it open .
exterior : very clean landscaping and easy parking .
large tvs in the four corners of the restaurant .
i had the original burger with provolone cheese .
give me a nice glass cup for the price .
cooked to the perfect temperature and very flavorful .
"oh well , maybe next time ."
"both flights were delayed , one a full hour ."
it is a good balance of price to location .
the rooms are rather nice too .
plenty to do here and plenty of swimming pools .
but the customer service is garbage .
it ' s a hookah lounge .
keep in mind that this lounge was not full .
there were maybe 0 tables being used .
service falls immensely short of the perceived atmosphere .
i ' d use them again .
everything was complete garbage .
refrain from eating here please !
save your money and go elsewhere .
first visit : 00/0000 great drinks .
poured some very good drinks .
great food with a great view !
"very , very , very expensive for thai food ."
"relaxing , low light ."
"better food , and better pricing ."

italian food should never cost this much .
fresh brewed tea was excellent .
they have perfected the italian sub sandwiches nicely .
desert was fresh <UNK> .
all was very good .
have nothing but praise for this place thus far .
"dessert was divine too , highly recommend ."
is under new ownership and new management .

very nice decoration with pleasant service .
it has a wide varieties of songs .
the food here is really good .

we arrived early enough to get in fast .
i use to love this place ... never more .

there basically two different areas with food .
i had a <UNK> .
nice new and clean .
the burger itself was good .
that is not a way to win a repeat .
great food and atmosphere .
warm and inviting but very metro .
both were served in a timely manner .
i was in both oral and total communication programs .

"very good sashimi , sushi and korean ."
told the manager and he gave me attitude .
the fries where average with no salt .
next time i ' ll give it a try .

"so , back to the food ."
"the owner is from buffalo , and it shows ."
do n't miss the chocolate souffle at the end !
the sushi is always fresh and very well presented .
chicken katsu is a great choice here .

food is good and ambiance is great .
food is tasty but portions are small .
do n't bring in starbucks from same plaza .
they ' ll make you toss it .

cents extra for a togo cup .
overall i give this restaurant a poor rating sadly .
"both salsas were very good , nice and fresh ."
the chips were sub par in my opinion .
the variety of taco options was very good .
"i think everyone need to try it ,"
the food itself has been good and relatively fresh .
la <UNK> potatoes were also excellent .
i had high expectations coming to this place .
the other breads were also very good .
` ` this is a main course ?
"but for $ 00 , this was ludicrous ."
the meat - wow .
i had a sinking feeling at this point .
it seems like it just keeps piling on .

i am stuck in phoenix for the night .
it seems like it just keeps piling on .
really wishes i went to ihop right outside instead .
my girlfriend asked for mayo got none .
food was just ok .
at least the beer was consistently good .
i had to spend that $ 00 voucher somewhere .
"noodles , veggies , sweet sauce ."
the lamb burger i ordered was pretty darn good .
the fries on the other hand sucked .
"sadly , i drank neither wine nor whiskey here ."
seems <UNK> given the name .
"- lrb - that ' s all , right ?"
here ' s what i learned .
"three people , that would work ."
they serve fresh sliced bread with it .
do not get the fries .
st . denis is a neat part of town .
it tasted pretty good to me .
i quite like this place .
at least the pizza was good .
"the pizza was , at best , mediocre ."
stumbled on this place quite by accident .
"once inside , expect - super cramped - quarters ."
everything we had was good though .
it goes on a scale of 0-00 .
you order ; it shows up .
i would have went back for this alone .
tip : do not overload on the bread .
only by a margin though .
she said yes you may .
"stop , do n't look anywhere else ."
good ny style pizza .
cheap drinks and wine as well .
we went there for vacation to las vegas .

this place is very hipster type of setup .
"like i said , a one time try ."
the ribs were sweet and smoked fresh !

tourists all over the place .
the worst place i have been .
such is the case here .
time will tell ... more later .

thanks for opening this place again .
i needed my bbq fix so .

this is a great place .
angela is a terrific bartender .
angela is a terrific bartender .
good luck everyone in the <UNK> locations .
. a place we could have done without .
give me a bbq break .
but it must have been a small chicken .
just what the heart doctor ordered .
. if white castle would only make an appearance .
both are worth the trip though !
shame for such a large chain .
a real taste sensation .
where ' s the beef ?
what more could you ask for .
nice patio and good happy hour .
robert did it again .
every production project is different requiring different <UNK> .
think about some softer items somewhere .
even in italy they hang <UNK> .
"ok , it ' s a personal thing ."
well ... disappointment central .
and get rid of those little carafes .
the fish and chips were miserable .
almost a feeling of hawaii .
hence ... 0 stars .
how do you say bon appetite in hawaiian ?
"great food , terrific drinks and nice people ."
the same original good food in a new place .
i love great hot and sour soup .
really ... a signature dish ?
got to say this place has become a loser .
fake onions rings made of mushy onion paste ?
the gnocchi had a great texture and good flavor .
very solid place and well worth checking out .
great shop to have your boat serviced or repaired .
the bread knots are also incredible .
fantastic service and a great atmosphere !
the servers are fantastic and the food is phenomenal .
not very good on this kind of sandwich .
the food on the other hand is simply embarrassing .
the seafood is the mainstay and was good .

the bangers and mash was spot on .
outstanding food and sublime service !
horrible experience compared to previous visits .
"great ribs , had the 00/00 platter !"

i would not recommend anyone to live here .
do yourself a favor and do not live here .
had a 0 night stay memorial day weekend .
atmosphere of the casino was amazing .
was n't lonely but was n't packed either .
everything was done with an attitude .
everything being thrown around or harshly .
worst subway i have ever been to .
they do good work on them .
this is great way to start the meal .
service is more of a 0 stars .
i give it 0â 0/0 stars .
the noodles were definitely decent in vegas .
miso ramen was too salty for me .
tonkatsu ramen was really tasty .
i had to just put it down .
the fish was warm .
it is always packed during lunch time .
the portions of this dish was pretty big .
: - rrb - hot deli services review only !
the food is good and reasonably priced .
the only negative is the shopping center its in .
the food and beer was once again top notch .
avoid this place at all costs !
this is a good starting spot in vegas .
only negative really is .
that it closes down at 0pm .
excellent service and very kind staff .
what a waste of tummy space and our time .
this place is a real local treat on central !
one of the best <UNK> buffets in vegas .
you can travel the world here .
this place <UNK> a blast .
it ' s a theme that is so wrong .
"fatty , greasy food and booze ."
no diet or lite anything .
add chili to everything and its even better .
add bacon and it ' s the bomb .
go for the fun .
enjoy the good food too .
"not bad , just average ."
it ' s just another below average mexican restaurant .
what was this guy doing here ?
this one little thing would improve this place immensely .
the food is top notch too .
"absolutely the best salsa in phoenix , bar none ."
service is almost always good and quick .
some of the best i ' ve ever had .
not a good place .
i would avoid this repair shop at all costs .
very professional and pleasant .
the work was top notch .
not a fair comparison .
"room : clean , nice , modern ."
the steak was dry and tough .
casino has generally relatively poor service .
they had a line for bbq chicken and beef .
the sides were good .
the show was great .
keep up the good work .
by far the best philly in phx .
"wow , what a pleasant change of pace ."
i will just comp this tab ' ' .
card has not been found .
i hope it was an off night .
they were rushing us not sure why .
i ' ll go back hope they improve .
incredibly fresh salmon and tuna .
they seem to know most everyone by name .
i enjoy the steaks and surf n turf .
cant wait for their next wine dinner .
much better than robertos and don <UNK> .
great selection of wines at very reasonable prices .
try the pork hock .
loved the tuna but the short rib was predictable .
restaurant looks great but food needs work .
the mussels with foie gras butter are absolutely perfect .
tuna tartare with potato waffle chips is uniquely seasoned .
cocktails are well thought out .
great selection of nicely priced wines .
after about 0 minutes our menu arrives .
best hook up yet .
"thanks , everyone at one nevada branch ."
this was a pleasant surprise .
total waste of time .
the custard and <UNK> on top were also perfect .
"restaurant / bar great atmosphere , outdoor seating ."
i would not recommend a group of over 00 .
portions were not huge but just right .
"the chili dog is pretty good , too ."
finally a place with good lad <UNK> !
today was my first visit .
the doc here is top notch !
"great atmosphere , good music and very friendly staff ."
probably the best sandwich shop in the area .
"clean place , friendly staff ."
their thin crust pizza is really good .
there is also a pool and workout facility onsite .
very good meal at a decent price .
excellent selection of breakfast food and beverages .
"friendly staff , and decent speed for a meal ."
i will test that out on my next visit .
"overall , good place to get a fresh sandwich ."
very fast service and very clean .
very knowledgeable and helpful staff .
a big location with plenty of inventory .
a great experience all around .
massive indoor shopping complex .
the cover charge for guys was $ 00 .
vegas is what it is .
lines out the driveway are n't uncommon .
best airport coffee place ever !
i think they should charge more .
most places would charge double for much less .
bad customer service and rude ass attitude .
that kind of service is a no no .
they also have some fine ales on draught .
a huge grocery store with a massive selection .
a nice little cafe with all-day breakfast .
this is some seriously fucking tasty pulled pork .
the problem is the burgers are expensive .
i expect more for this price .
"beside the burgers , the cheese sticks are fantastic ."
the place to go for poutine .
essential for groceries if you ' re staying nearby .
the entire concert hall feels very bright and natural .
turns out that was a good decision .
the chorizo sandwich is amazing .
the bread is squishy but just so .
why design your store like a giant candy labyrinth ?
"however , even cheesy madness has its limits ."
the prices are cheap and the portions are ample .
not exactly worth $ 0.00 plus tax .
a great five guys .
"a crappy , overpriced definition of a tourist trap ."
well run and clean .
an enthusiastic ` ` meh ' ' .
but chipotle this is not .
the ingredients are fresh and well-prepared .
the burger presentation is top-notch .
so what could possibly be amiss ?
"friendly staff , and great upstairs ."
good views of the high street .
"amazing cupcakes , both miniature and normal ."
an excellent free museum .
equally great for escaping the elements outside .
and the staff at this particular location are tremendous .
the castle itself is pretty impressive .
the best there is .
"solid coffee , but only average food ."
nothing special about this location .
when the food arrived it was adequate .
i will not stay there again .
"simple , cheap , good ."
"not overly salted , nicely spiced ."
really really crap decor .
do not buy a gift card here .
what do you know ?
i wo n't make that mistake again .
wow has this place gone downhill .
"wow , this is the real deal ."
this place is every bit as good .
the place is immaculate and the ingredients very fresh .
food ... even worse .
it ruined the rest of my trip .
our family loves cafã © rio .
food was on the bland side to me though .
ã  touffã © e was not even close .
very cool atmosphere and service was good .
a taco place with no salsa or <UNK> ?
i ' d highly recommend the chicago dog .
this place is also very reasonably priced .
the first time was better than the second .
"the hot dog was good , not great ."
the <UNK> was nothing short of amazing .
i had the americana dog on my last visit .
this bakery features several different flavors of pristine cupcakery .
goyemon does everything right .
ayce sushi does not get any better than this .
"firstly , the food is outstanding ."
00 minutes ... worth the wait .
bfg or baked fried grilled delivers on every level .
"in my opinion , they still do ."
"where to start , oh yeah , pizza !"
the pizza is amazing .
threatened to <UNK> remove me from the gym .
this guy is a <UNK> beyond words !
go in lift weights and get out .
"then , i left ."
the urine stench was stronger .
"anyway , be ready to spend money here ."
i went on all 0 rides here .
the patty was n't even that succulent .
"xs is a very beautiful club , damn ."
the inside and outside have a good vibe .
all the bartenders were pretty hot .
that might be a factor for you .
"for these , i give the place 0 stars ."
i hope your experience here is good .
service was excellent and the atmosphere is nice .
this is a straight up mexican restaurant .
they also serve the beer sol .
i remember getting lobster mac & cheese .
pretty good - - i ' d recommend it .
i ' d also recommend the skirt steak .
the food was tasty and not too oily .
the place is always open .
this place is whack .
dj am probably does not dj here .
people need to dance and not walk around .
lots of walking to get there .
spend your money at the blackjack tables instead .
"oh well , ca n't beat free ."
"the service is top notch , very elegant ."
their selection for men ' s clothing is great .
they know how to pick brands .
"unique combination , but nonetheless good ."
i ' d recommend this place .
walking in is pretty damn cool on its own .
the decorations and aura of the place are incredible .
your taste buds will thank you .
is it worth taking a taxi here ?
"albeit , this is a decent breakfast eatery ."
this buffet is alright .
these innovative ideas make simon really stand out .
the free bread they provide was also pretty tasty .
it ' s basically $ 00 / person .
presentation of food was perfect .
the background music they would play was very samba .
the bathrooms were incredibly nice .
the view is definitely worthwhile .
everything was pretty good except for the asian food .
my server seemed pissed off for some reason .
i ordered a beer .
secret pizza joints own .
i liked how it was by a waterfall outside .
the whole place is well ventilated .
"there ' s two bars , i believe ."
the vibe in general is just really good .
sw is the truth .
marquee is just like an old <UNK> hotel .
' ' there are hardly any street lights .
the lobster is substantial and tasty .
this made my trip worth everything .
"in the future , maybe this will change ?"
i ' m being sarcastic .
the place is great - small and quick .
well let me tell you - it was great .
i was n't going to write a review initially .
' ' how cool is that ?
everything i ' ve eaten has been great .
also the chili is bomb !
what else do you need to know ?
very fresh and very good .
everything was absolutely great .
they obviously know a 0 year old eats slowly .
excellent choice and good sized for the price .
the dressing was very good as well .
all in all it was an excellent lunch .
this is the exception .
the service is second to none .
the good news was it came out fast .
the bad news was it was n't worth eating .
i hope to try brio again some day .
"it could happen , right ?"
unless you are 000lbs you should sit inside .
boy am i glad i did .
the pool area is in the center courtyard .
and big ... well for a hotel room .
one was even across the street .
nothing over the top .
bathroom was small and nothing special .
not worthy of a 0 star hotel .
"no fridge , no microwave ."
the wire connection was at fast at least .
not 00 ... 0 .
to take a break flip to red .
i have to say the food was simply outstanding .
the carbonara was flavorful and rich while not overpowering .
plenty of tvs for watching the steelers .
the staff was all very friendly .
this soup could feed an army .
"it was very spicy , but very good ."
great food and service .
had the salmon salad - great fish !
next they run out of food .
i ordered a lamb gyro wrap .
i have been craving it ever since .
this is n't your typical chain restaurant .
amazing way to start a meal .
i had ordered bacon and instead received sausage .
this place just has a much better vibe !
the sourdough bread was amazing .
they have the best food .
last night i had the <UNK> .
at first i rather liked the place .
sam did and we discussed the work needed .
picking up the car was the real upsetting part .
in a word wow !
both were surprisingly tasty .
you will not be disappointed .
repeat after me can you say green mint chutney .
i ' m a fan .
veal chop or the 00oz rack of lamb .
this is the place if you love brisket .
look on the board for lunch specials .
<UNK> ' s is a great place for lunch .
with a side of chipotle sauce .
the original is the bomb .
the best late night stop on vegas strip .
"about the same price , with the deductible ."
no one checked the adjustment or test drove it .
"recorded the est , of course ."
"right , no test drive ."
finally learned my lesson .
no one checked the adjustment or test drove it .
"recorded the est , of course ."
did n't make it two miles to home .
"right , no test drive ."
finally learned my lesson .
they made the day go off without a hitch .
lots and lots of happy staff everywhere .
one trip to this place did that for me .
better than krispy kreme .
` ` the bad ' ' was the service .
plate presentations were terrible .
as if my issue was petty and <UNK> .
sweet potato pie is the best i ever had .
decor traditional chinese restaurant on the lower end .
food took 00 minutes for two sandwiches .
food is excellent and service just as good .
both were tasty with great texture and portion size .
"lobster corn chowder had corn , but no lobster ."
my girlfriend got the blackened salmon caesar salad .
dim sum is great and cheap .
late afternoon food sitting long time and not fresh .
seafood department very good too .
had to flag him down for check .
recently saw <UNK> with my wife .
"be forewarned , the cocktail service sucked ."
their show was a pure class act .
stayed in the palace tower deluxe room 0 nights .
property was well maintained and clean 0 .
comfortable bed and well maintained rooms 0 .

the bloody mary ' s outstanding .
this is a great restaurant .
not too much that it <UNK> the taste .
my wife and i loved this show .
this is a must see .
remember vegas runs on tips .
i would recommend the bellagio to anyone .
"the service was good , refill water quick ."
just next to the popular tao night club .
the crowd was mostly in older 00 and higher .
"at top of that , they provided free wi-fi ."
the room was clean and everything was functional .
look more modern than five star hotel like wynn .
"overall , this is good hotel consider the price ."
* price not included the 0.0 % sales tax .
probably the worst jumbo shrimp i ' ve tasted .
there was no specialty or hand roll here .
but many other dish were average and even bad .
this floor does not rotated like fancy restaurant below .
the ten seconds can save minute or even hour .
which is a good crowd control .
came for lunch with my wife .
"a smallish , <UNK> joint ."
the staff is fairly friendly and fast .
prices are cheap for montreal .
all the sandwiches are on toasted sesame bread .
"worth the money , but not too great ."
"if you want good asian food , look elsewhere ."
this is our favorite restaurant in squirrel hill .
"really good , seemingly authentic chinese food ."
nice quiet place to relax .
"great food , good service , good prices ."
the extra speed is appreciated .
meatheads has become my burger of choice .
pan seared chicken sandwich was delectable .
man does is hit hard .
stopped here prior to pitt football game .
my wife had <UNK> and lentil soup .
but this deserved it .
the line is absolutely the worst .
avoid if you can .
the ceviche was great .
hipsters do n't like to be called hipsters .
brunch here is pretty good though .
they pack the tables really close together .
i rate vietnamese restaurants mainly based on the pho .
sometimes you need a good meal late at night .
edit : went back .
nice people and great food .
great service and awesome donuts with some interesting flavors .
this is that sort of place .
"good solid bar fare , great people ."
the <UNK> was sufficient for an ample adult meal .

the <UNK> are adequate and include a <UNK> .
- friendly and attentive staff .
they can easily upgrade this and they should .

request for improvement : better individual room environmental controls .
i wo n't give anything away but plan accordingly .
lunch preset menu was great !
the service was exceptional .
very good find for las vegas .
it ' s a nice suburban area .
actually found this place on accident .
check-in was pretty easy i did the early check-in .
overall i enjoyed my stay .
but that ' s the only reason .
best pre-game shot you can ever do .
definitely check it out whenever you see one .
same saturday crowd as i remember .
being at a place with no dress code 0 .
kitchen is open until 0am .
steve <UNK> was the dj that night .
apparently they have guest djs here all the time .
the club itself is pretty big .
we left after 0 songs .
mostly everybody in phoenix loves this place .

my favorite mountain in the city .
the toughest one out of all them .
you are in moderately good shape 0 .

so yeah was n't staying and waiting there .
bouncers were friendly staff was attentive .
stayed here the weekend before halloween .
yeah they were wood grain shutters .
yeah i know right ?
expect crowds at any gym between 0-0 p .
- - that is not a complaint .
best bar in the ahwatukee area .
i just recommend going elsewhere .
"howard , you da man !"
never going back again best little sandwich spot downtown !
you will not be disappointed .
definitely worth checking out .
brunch here is awesome .
great fresh salmon and philadelphia roll .
pretty good happy hour .
typically come here for brunch .
but dinner is excellent as well .
service was great food was quick .
overpriced and not at all worth it for drinks .
this place is great .
pretty good brisket and mac and cheese .
"sent food back twice , then gave up ."
used a <UNK> certificate with no trouble .

you ' ll save at least 0/0 .
the guide kept calling and there was no response .
verdict : one of the must-visit sites in montreal .
this was filling and wonderful .
what ' s so awesome about this airline ?
- on tap root beer .
. rant over ... now onto review .
service : very friendly .
the people were great and welcoming .
decor : kind of like a very big diner .
it ' s kind of the exact opposite here .
. this monorail is da bomb !
the views - wow !
the food - wow !
the servers - wow !
"anyways , on to the food ."
entrã © e : filet mignon with some greens .
it was like 00 to 00 oz .
i went a tour in may 0000 .
it was a few hundred dollars .
you think <UNK> is bad in a crop plane ?
then this is n't the ride for you .
- the locker room is kind of cool .
shucked on the spot for you .
"while not ideal bikes , they did the job ."
dislikes : - way too loud in here .
- servers just dump dishes on your table .
not really great value .
it came to around $ 00 total including tax .
i normally go to chang ' s on decatur .
garbage cans were over flowing .
00 minute wait at 0 pm on a thursday .
i watched countless people walk away .
food was hit and miss .
literally pennies worth of food .
i ' m not sure how that gets overlooked .
pool could use a <UNK> .
nothing comes even close to it .
good beer for sure .
"avoid the carnitas tacos , however ."
awesome decor and great food .
"at that time , i lived in phoenix ."
all the various dogs have been tried and enjoyed !
the main courses arrived hot .
the main courses arrived hot .
the broth was very clear and flavorful .
go watch the o ' or jubilee .
it ' s much more entertaining .
and the person in charge was confrontational .
took my partner for his birthday dinner .
not sure what the deal was .
thats the main reason for 0 stars .
"my wife got the kalbi ramen , good choice ."
the chicken teriyaki i got was unremarkable .
perhaps a bit harsh there .
probably a once every 0 years restaurant for me .
<UNK> will probably be no better .
stay far far away from this place .
"assistant manager was great , knowledgeable , helpful ."
<UNK> latte tasted like drinking <UNK> chalk in water .
can not go here regularly without breaking the bank .
our <UNK> bbq hot dish thing was an abomination .
the <UNK> <UNK> was also quite excellent .
"he was excellent , <UNK> a giant tip ."
0/0 easily on service .
all in all a 0/0 experience i think .
they will get repeat business from us .
they definitely earned two new regulars .
i would recommend them to anyone needing roofing services .
horrible ` ` professional ' ' .
never have used them and never will .
i was disappointed with the beer selection .
the practice of providing medical care was not .
"i stopped him , showing the obvious size issue ."
core did none of this .
unfortunately they failed here .
there ' s always reason .
got me some falafel mix and imported kinder chocolates !
never had a bad meal here .
prices have gone way up .
so last night was one of those nights .
this place has gone down hill .
this dealership sure works hard not to earn business .
"still , these are minor criticisms ."
good service and nice people .
the bar / restaurant reminds me of germany .
no hotel security person to be found anywhere .
good food and good people .
00 + draft beers and countless bottles .
definitely a unique place in a very good way .
you are guaranteed a great time .
i expected more of a <UNK> consistency .
they are quite good at plating their food .
there was potential there .
i ' ll give them that .
"it was incredibly chewy , in a bad way ."
"good idea , but poorly executed food ."
- rrb - are all nice .
the staff here are consistently all friendly and courteous .
too bad they do n't sell it by itself .
"now , there are ."
this is one of the <UNK> bars in pittsburgh .
family went in for calamari and pizza .
and what <UNK> the wait was the understaffed bar .
finally making it on the third try .
"well , you get the idea ."
that ' s what you ' ll get !
the sooner the better .
the rooms are equivalent to most timeshare <UNK> .
that ' s what ` ` <UNK> my appetite .
but would i return ?
and a <UNK> about ` ` best value .
this is not traditional brazilian churrascaria .
"well , you get the idea , right ?"
this is more a <UNK> than a tourist hotel .
than this is your place .
it was ` ` all incredibly good .
everything we ordered was excellent ... period .
that ' s how they start you off .
"- rrb - , and quality of service ."
it was very good .
the food does deliver .
review by an ` ` out-of-towner ' ' ... .
you can read those right here on this page .
who has rolls of quarters for parking ?
and does n't phoenix know about credit card meters ?
enough said ; it all works .
"but now , i have a very good alternative ."
and about those ` ` reasonable ' ' prices ?
not as high as you might think .
that ' s very reasonable for a steakhouse meal .
your kabobs are cooked to order .
this is my current 0 - star winner .
phoenix was experiencing the tale end of summer .
i did enjoy my turkey burger and veggies .
and that great gnocchi .
enough said on that .
and just how good was that ?
that could ' ve been a meal in itself .
they serve those beers at fat heads .
pittsburgh has something the west coast does n't .
' ' and it should start at fat heads !
that ' s when i discovered metro on tropicana .
the plan did work .
that ' s the next search on my list .
this hotel was well thought out by steve wynn .
and my reason for 0 stars ?
had i ever visited another bonefish ?
i really did n't know it was a franchise .
lotus of siam is a real find .
- rrb - it was a very good meal .
the meats do all the talking .
a meal that held me over for two nights .
i finished the second half the following day .
"for me , that ' s worth allot ."
skinnyfats may be your best bet in las vegas .
the interior is very ` ` <UNK> .
it ' s a <UNK> system .
' ' fogo de chao in <UNK> .
' ' i just want good food and service .
what the he * * happened to vegas ?
"we ordered the halibut , blackened ."
"and unfortunately , the sides overshadowed the entree ."
"i was expecting a thick , large steak ."
wo fat is awesome !
the best hawaiian food in town .
here is where it gets great .
then they opened them at sunset which was cool .
very very good brew .
"so , this place is ok ."
not great but not that bad either .
the location is also great .
it is absolutely incredible .
meat was smokey and juicy .
got the chicken fried steak with country potatoes .
pricing was excellent and outlined up <UNK> surprises .
"the technician , lance , arrived on time ."
great food and service .
"great service , portions , and quality fish ."
expensive for what you get .
the miniscule beef skewer was mostly fat .
highly reccomend <UNK> to all .
these guys are not <UNK> !
this place was horrible .
claim jumper use to be so good .
taste like everything was frozen and processed .
go to cpk or brio right around the corner .
0 - rrb - the food is terrific .
unclear what all the fuss is about .
the locker room is humongous and well-appointed .
this is the only clearance store in the country .
the flavor is <UNK> .
great view and very good service .
very cool little bar .
will be back great service by an attentive staff .
"cool atmosphere , good food , great beer ."
check it out when in phoenix area .
will definitely go back very soon .
"i have been back , and will go again ."
great quirky interior and pleasant service .
all in all not a good experience .
needless to say no pints were bought .
interesting mixed toilets deal going on .
a chipper to make more use of i think .
the food itself was good .
ca n't comment on the korean angle .
expensive for what you get .
very friendly and efficient service too .
well stuffed for # 00 .
<UNK> certainly no complaints .
definitely somewhere else on the list of <UNK> .
pretty average southern american fast food place .
possibly that ' s a sign of authenticity .
worth every penny of the # 00 per head .
the eggs benedict is decent too .
probably not unless a price war starts .
pints of stella currently at # 0.00 .
<UNK> that ' s been achieved to good effect .
are n't we in a recession ?
well priced with a decent range of dishes .
# 0.00 for a large bottle of <UNK> ?
excellent service in a relaxed atmosphere and cosy surroundings .
well stocked bar manned by friendly & knowledgeable staff .
best described as a hole .
no complaints about the courteous staff though .
had a great meal here on saturday night .
had dinner here on monday this week .
could maybe do with opening past 00:00 .
the service was very good too .
definitely an establishment still punching its weight .
good service and very well made food .
the place clearly does a good takeaway trade too .
in my opinion the best of the edinburgh <UNK> .
one of the <UNK> and welcoming pubs in edinburgh ?
not really one for the locals this .
nothing special on the real ale front though .
wo n't be back in a hurry .
nice new <UNK> sinks installed though .
pretty cool professionally <UNK> gents toilets .
"well priced , <UNK> sized menu and tasty curries ."
soft drinks are bottomless too .
the house white was a well chosen south african .
a continuing favourite though .
went there last night .
the place is also way too small .
that too was very good .
highly recommended if you have kids .
great family outing in vegas .
the griddled mashed potatoes was also excellent .
i would most likely not return .
i found a really cool <UNK> <UNK> mountain <UNK> .
it was all cooked very well .
tempered what could ' ve been a superb dish .
the red rooms as i recall .
the room was a dump .
"of course , the food is superb ."
the flavor and texture were perfect .
"good , strong beer but very drinkable ."
the soup was nothing short of phenomenal .
i then had the farm & field burger .
this was the other highlight of the meal .
desserts were entirely forgettable .
stk really split opinions among my group .
"the theater is just too large , too grand ."
save your money and do n't waste your time .
the salads were ok at best .
simply put scarpetta is my favorite vegas restaurant .
the portions are great .
the price is very appropriate .
the first experience was great .
some advice on going .
0 restaurants for the price of one really .
bacchanal is the one buffet worth going to .
pretty much a dump .
there may have been a gym somewhere .
i think i was paying between 00-00 per night .
<UNK> gets a massive amount of hype around champaign .
"which , i have to say , very good ."
the rolls are definitely ample .
0 rolls was sufficient for 0 people for dinner .
both had good amounts of fish and eel .
outstanding beer selection at very reasonable prices .
that ' s the bottom line .
00 + truly does have its benefits .
"great atmosphere , great vibe ."
the food ' s surprisingly good as well .
but you really go to legends for the atmosphere .
0 - rrb - never enough space .
0 - rrb - hot as hell .
there ' s no air circulation whatsoever .
the bourbon room is an incredibly <UNK> bar .
the bourbon room is nothing like that though .
they were melt-in-your-mouth incredible .
"the fish was cooked perfectly , seasoned excellently ."
and the portion of the side was enormous .
would go back again in a heart beat .
it is simply fantastic .
solid 0 star restaurant though .
and the food and beer were great .
the food at <UNK> is solid .
any pint for just $ 0 .
"that simple , that ' s all you need ."
the service was another issue .
fantastic start to the meal .
unfortunately the dessert was a mixed bag .
the carrot cake was utter garbage .
what an absolute dump .
it was always very good .
the baseball watching is better from the stands .
prices are standard ballpark prices .
<UNK> ice cream going on up in here .
"both were superb , just the right consistency ."
the scoops are pretty medium sized .
as in there was a lot of space .
"breakfast is free , but pretty crappy ."
the food was passable .
"not bad , but nothing terribly interesting ."
"my god , the service ."
"first , can i talk about the menu ?"
"what is this , a theme restaurant in vegas ?"
pizza is just about all grimaldi ' s does .
the service was very good the whole night .
scottsdale eats earlier than denver does .
the food was solidly above average .
it was exactly what i was looking for .
i believe it was the waldorf .
the free wifi worked well and had good speed .
"it was fantastic , if messy ."
this is a cool restaurant .
service was a little spotty all night .
"the main courses , though , were good ."
the waitress was friendly .
"add hot sauce , it ' s good ."
does n't get much better than that .
the fried ice cream is pretty good too .
the security lines are not all created equally .
riding in the summers in vegas is borderline insane .
first the online reservations is awesome .
"i mean anywhere , even online ."
never a dissatisfied experience or visitor .
the staff is friendly and the food is great .
probably the best thing i had all night .
the standouts were the ribs and brisket .
a good addition to the vegas bbq scene !
this is one of favorite italian restaurants in vegas .

- hugh grant - lrb - pop !
the chicken was solid as well .
signature tasting menu : 0 .
the view of the strip is spectacular as well .
the chicken was cooked very well and stayed juicy .
this place is a little deceiving from up front .

in field home run in my eyes .
what a great experience we had at bonefish today .

worth a visit if you have n't been .
literally made an account to write this review .
giada is a true treasure of restaurant .
the outside seating area is very nice .
complete amateur hour operation .
big mistake eating here .
man that egg makes the sandwich .
you can sample any flavor you like .
00 % i think .
meh is about right .
when it ' s hot every minute counts .
an old house converted into a pub .
the propane is convenient too .
and it is always good to support local businesses .
great selections and pricing you ca n't beat elsewhere .
i would trust ray with anything .
friendly upbeat staff who seem to love their work .
chicken taco combo plate was flavourful .
you ca n't go wrong here .
"absolutely lousy service , and really expensive ."
my experience is quite the opposite however .
that is a pretty huge factor in my book .
the enchiladas were great and the service was outstanding .
first we found el <UNK> sol .
i give a lot of credit to mike minor .
"but now , a third find ."
"i know , seems strange , but very good ."
"again , i ' m on the strip ?"
so the restaurant did have some cigarette smoke issues .
- lrb - except for a few .
you read that correctly .
you have been warned .
lots of high-end and <UNK> .
"and yes , they were expensive ."
"not with the stench , day and night ."
it continued with being assigned the wrong car .
a desire to help others ?
- rrb - shame on me .
"overall , a very good dish ."
"buffets or ala carte , both experiences are outstanding ."
next came the entrees .
the rose was also outstanding .
opener : we shared two dishes .
"the housemade pate , which was excellent ."
"- lrb - not too gamey , perfect balance ."
i ' m done with them .
so what did we try ?
"a lot , but nothing from mexico or italy ."
we got lots of stuff from the asian section .
- potstickers : good .
then on to the seafood section .
"- bay shrimps , various preparations : avoid ."
- ceviches : avoid .
spouse had lots more .
' ' - rrb - and some polish thing .
"fascinating read , <UNK> ."
but back to the meal .
"it was actually quite interesting , and enjoyable ."
corkage was quoted as twenty five dollars !
new to the lv region .
"ordered cadillac margarita , which was ok but expensive ."
all very friendly and attentive .
"the food was great , but expensive ."
the tips must be good .
what is wrong with these corporate <UNK> ?
do they want to drive business away ?
"again , very well done ."
- torta di <UNK> : apple pie .
i moved from la to lv in dec 0000 .
i have found his replacement .
"great attitude , great prices ."
i wo n't go anywhere else .

friend 0 : scotch on the rocks .
- rrb - the bill came .
"goodbye , griddle cafe ."
"but a great idea , imho ."
nice restaurant & staff .
"- rrb - , looked thru the menu again ."

"came hoping to love , left a little disappointed ."
"good , not great ."

bouchon @user venetian 0 .
i know nothing about jerry ' s nugget .
hopefully i ' ll get to all 0 soon .
no more china grill .
overall an excellent experience .
they have also been quite good with <UNK> items .
i ' ll start with the pros .
"as i said , the pizzas are stellar ."
a close third place ?
"<UNK> lamb , only available in south africa ."
"get the lamb chops , if on the menu ."
"please reopen , even if across town ."
this was a surprise .
- foie gras burger .
- salmon w / risotto & smoked tomato sauce .
perhaps the best side item on the entire menu .
"now , regarding the <UNK> re : truffle oil ."
"thin , weak , sad ."
- dry aged prime t-bone steak .
"first day this week , rather <UNK> ' ."
"rest of the week , good to great service ."
many many rentals later .
"great staff , bartenders , waitresses ."
every dish was just sublime .
you will not be disappointed .
none of them seemed to want to be there .
i ' ve enjoyed everywhere tremendously .
i am a strip patron and a <UNK> patron .
spouse really liked the chicken fried chicken .
"i said to myself , why not ?"
that ' s fair enough .
"- rrb - , and were actually pretty good ."
"spouse got the salad , and was quite happy ."
"if it was , it was surprising ."
we promptly left after dinner .
but i doubt that will happen .
it continued throughout most of our visit .
times have certainly changed .
this place was fantastic .
"thai beef jerky was good , too ."
only negative : no booze .
"a creole concept , supposedly , very rich ."
- rrb - and the quality difference was stunning .
"ok selection , but expensive ."
"spouse got it this time around , shells throughout ."
whereas the steak house is enclosed !
"but no water offered , all four times ."
' ' and quickly move on .
perhaps something has changed since that recommendation ?
but the food was poor .
"only did delivery , so service not reviewed ."
"crabmeat fried rice good , not great ."
first stop at the ghost town was really enjoyable .
lunch at tortilla flats was nice .
the scenery is incredible .
ok so we were just there an hour ago .
attendant fixes problem and apologies for problems .
then the bill comes .
it is staffed by complete idiots .
dealing with their billing department is a time sink .
the soup base is good .
cool atmosphere and nice staff .
great value for a reasonable price .
we saw the jersey boys great show .
i will never do business with this company again .
yo pauly ' s makes incredible pizzas .
i always get the roast beef .
go with some good friends .
everywhere else i found the service to be nice .
the food was very good .
beside the produce displays the quality is very good .
they have a big selection of fresh food .
all being cooked and prepared as you watch .
inside of store was clean and orderly .
"plenty of tables , kind of a garden setting ."
they handled this well .
another nice thing is they <UNK> the table .
i will more than likely eat there again .
i wanted a burger looked on yelp .
coney island grill was close .
all i can say is wow .
my burger came out and it was very good .
she gets 0/0 of a pumpkin loaf cake .
this store always treats us very well .
in mesa today shopping for christmas present .
my wife and i got sandwiches and enjoyed them .
the food is good .
not great but good .
this place is a good place .
"nice neat , looked to be very clean ."
the usual as most i have visited .
i am not by any way a sushi expert .
plus many other dishes .
and i got to watch my meal being <UNK> .
this was a very good choice on my part .
yes this did finish a fine meal right .
not a problem at the ace at 00st .
almost always have what i want .
or some would salad stuff .
their salads makings are always fresh and attractive .
they do make a big chunk chicken noodle soup .
parking lot is small .
not sure what you call the decor .
nice relaxed atmosphere plenty of room .
ty was our waiter and did a superb job .
spent time to answer questions .
and that is fair .
everyone has their rules .
i got the chicken with biscuit dumplings .
the meal was very taste .
plenty left for a meal at home .
give them a try .
she just gets a little everyday .
i have been there about 0 times now .
"friendly , helpful staff ."
their expresso is much better that most .
i order by description .
call it what you want .
give them a try if you are downtown .
<UNK> to many of the sandwich shops .
"clean , open layout , appealing looks ."
usually do n't give 0 start on first visit .
not bad for lunch hour .
the decor is pleasant and fits the restaurant theme .
i would call this place trendy .
this is not a bad word .
i was told the salad was very good .
the presentation was good .
it did not taste bad in any way .
it just did not taste as i expected .
the ahi tacos were excellent .
except i would have to have another ahi taco .
the best part was dining with friends .
we had a great time eating and talking .
i had some of these and they were good .
support your local business .
life is short enjoy yourself eat good food .
now it is <UNK> ' s .
"i had my standard , 0 eggs over easy ."
most places serve them over medium or over well .
go see them i think you will enjoy .
why do we keep returning ?
the food is priced reasonably .
there is something on the menu for all tastes .
they have always treat us as a valued customer .
the salad was excellent .
open air hot dogs and burgers .
actually i never noticed the place .
found it on yelp .
stop buy when you are in the area .
most all have the same look and feel .
their choices are limited .
<UNK> ' s is a locally owned restaurant .
for this reason alone is a reason to return .
"menu is burgers , sandwiches , chicken , fish ."
the service was excellent .
better than most places .
knowing this made the experience more enjoyable .
these are very nice people .
the bad is it is expensive .
that is what i did .
interesting place to visit .
this is a fairly new place .
the food was good and prices reasonably .
this place is a small building .
these are located outside in the arizona heat .
none of these being my choice .
if that is proper to say .
i had a hot dog .
and a very good hot dog at that .
hey it is a sandwich shop .
appropriate decor for a sandwich shop .
"response , ` ` anything you want ' ' ."
kinda of a guessing game .
i do n't give out many 0 ' s .
"the food was plentiful , hot , and taste ."
very clean and friendly place .
they have lunch meals for less than $ 0.00 .
with drink was just over $ 0.00 per meal .
my wife got the orange chicken .
this place just got started .
you will enjoy your food and service .
this was my 0th trip .
you ca n't get better value anywhere .
they have a great menu .
the quality of food is excellent .
everything is fixed fresh while you wait .
the rice is a very good quality .
all the main dishes are meat .
i have struggled on how to rate them .
the food was excellent .
the service was excellent .
these should of been delivered at same time .
cost $ 000.00 + the tip .
i rated them 0 stars .
"the food , was good ."
would i go back ? ? no .
today i chose five guys for lunch .
no fries as i do n't need the calories .
fast place to get something to eat .
no complaint over the price .
the tuna had a slight fishy taste to it .
not a good sign .
to many other places in the area to eat .
yes if i was in the area .
love the layout of the business .
the pizza is ok but many places make better .
decoration is appropriate for the food they are serving .
the place has always been very clean .
the makings for a great sandwich .
so what kind of cheese do they use ?
those sandwiches really looked good and they said so .
i have been in several times .
i see some lower rating .
i have always been treated very well .
the selection was not bad .
nothing wrong with the food .
besides there is much more food to try .
it is an adventure .
you never know what you are going to get .
i will wait till it cools of a little .
i must search them out .
it is just a hamburger nothing exceptional .
they do have good fries .
i went wow where is the beef .
guess i can blame it on the economy .
not to be negative .
hopefully you do not take it as being negative .
the people at the restaurant did everything right .
now for the bad .
their burger was better than most places .
had a battery go dead .
took the alternator in and had it tested .
this time i had an alternator quit and removed .
put that one on the pu .
pep boys refuses to help me with the matter .
i will not ever go back to buy parts .
"their pizza <UNK> , the thin crust is excellent ."
chevre / <UNK> and interesting cheese .
both were excellent choices .
so i went with the lamb .
dinner lasted from 0:00 to 0:00 .
you should go also .
tonight my wife and i went there to eat .
probably 00 or less .
had not eaten breakfast yet .
my wife suggested the good egg .
there are several in the phoenix area .
you could tell by the interaction with the staff .
they claim to be new mexico style .
they have several dishes with hatch chilies in it .
my favorite dish is the chicken especial .
service is about a 0.0 .
there are several of them around town .
have eaten here several times over the years .
decorated with sports memorabilia .
maybe only the bears .
they serve a hot dog much like everyone else .
my wife had a ring she would not wear .
to me they do n't hold much interest .
this equals value to me .
i know what i bought is what i got .
everyone in the store will treated you well .
two shots with one inch of foam .
the foam is a buffer for the expresso .
usually on sunday holidays .
breakfast is the only meal i have eaten .
your coffee cup is kept full .
why would anyone in the area go anywhere else ?
not exceptional as i had expected form the reviews .
i still have a problem with sign .
farther back is some booths .
i had decided on the beef <UNK> soup .
my wife got shrimp laid out on sweet potatoes .
she said the shrimp and sweet potato was good .

would just depend on what i was wanting .
i had the <UNK> .
"came with mash potato dumplings , red cabbage ."
did i like what i had ?
yes ! ! very tasty .
many offerings i have never seen before .
my suggestion is go there and experience the food .
the food was positively a 0 .
the store was a 0 .
nothing bad just not a 0 .
so i gave the place a 0 .
the experience just seems more personal .
i got the island dog with tater tots .
the place is decorated island style .
maui dog was by far better than the rest .
the place was clean .
the price for what you got was good .
if you just want a hot dog .
what a neat place for lunch .
these tacos were what i would call street tacos .
the ones i had was good .

service was as good as it gets .
my teriyaki bowel was delivered first .
the food was good and plentiful and inexpensive .

quite and low lighting .
give them a try .
matthew was very attentive but not overly attentive .
my wife got the fish special .
not greasy as fish fried can get .
it could of been a very good salad .
the ingredients were as the most part excellent .
not crispy as it should be .
i will probably try them again .
the apple tart with ice cream .
this was very good .
just what the community needs .
eat at a franchised burger joint ?
not many whataburger left in phoenix .
i ate at them years ago in phoenix .
then i started working in el paso texas .
whataburger wants your business and acts like it .
give them a try .
they have always treated me well .
their place is always very clean and neat .
they always look forward to the <UNK> .
easy place to shop .
if you are lucky you may get two .
they have been in business for three weeks .
minuses ? ? none at this time .
"go see them , support your local businesses ."
this is one place that is consistent .
not because of bad food .
some of us will tell the management .
hard to describe the place .
what it reminded me of was the old <UNK> .
this is another place for me to visit again .
way more that anyone should eat .
everything was very good .
few people get just a cup of coffee .
two shots of expresso with an inch of foam .
nice people good coffee .
go see them it is worth the visit .
my wife got the chicken pot pie soup .
both was very good .
several checks to see if everything was ok .
they are very worth a visit .
reason to get a large .
everyone has their own rating scale .
if you blink you will miss the building .
parking in front is limited .
the theme is music .
the room is laid out simple tables and booths .
everything looked clean and orderly .
some places are not or want to charge extra .
wife out of town .
fresh wasabi was less than a mile away .
i guess typical of most i have been to .
i am learning but still need help .
i asked my waitress what she suggested .
just got back form ronnie ' s cafe .

nailed in place but never quite finished .
we were treated as valued guests .
my wife got the cinnamon french toast .
conclusion ? ? good place eat breakfast .
food is reasonable priced and good .
service we received was very good .
usually just their pasta bowel .

there is a place near him called rocket burger .
they have a pretty good menu .
i had the bacon burger .
his wife i think had a burger .
we got two orders of fries .
what i had was very good .
everyone seemed to like what they got .
the portions are large .
meaning you get good value for your dollar .
they have a pretty large and assorted menu .
others could learn something from this .
go see them you will enjoy your visit .
rocket burger again why do i keep going back ?
the nicest people you would ever want to meet .
always checking to see if everything is good .
here taste just fine the way they are .
keep it up rocket burger .
ca n't wait to see what is new .
i visit rocket burger several times a month .
not as often as i would like .
there are many reasons i go there .
the nicest people you could ever meet .
go in and say hi .
i got the carne adovada plate .
the hotter the better .
plenty of tvs to watch your favorite team play .
my wife got a veggie pizza .
she said it was very good .
plenty more on the menu .
the service was great .
forgot to say ... welcome to the neighborhood .
service can very from time to time .
basically a sports bar pizza place decor .
they have many beers to drink .
my wife and i usually split a meal .
it has closed 00 min before we found it .
i thought it was fitting the place .
i had the brisket and the fruit dish .
no wow this is good .
i thought the food just average .
the brisket was a vey nice cut of meat .
i tried their bbq sauce .
this was my third trip .
i got the beef <UNK> .
the last times i had the pulled pork .
the food is a high 0 stars .
need more than one bbq sauce on the table .
one drawback is parking .
my son suggested el bravo because of reviews .
i am going ` ` good start ' ' .
"nothing exceptional , good ."
today i decided to head west and south .
saw taps they were new to this shopping center .
taps looks like a sports bar when you enter .
we were seated and very soon offered drinks .
my wife also liked her meal .
so the food gets a 0 .
probably go there once every one to two months .
that was the good .
they no longer offer the fortune cookie .
now if you want some you have to ask .
decoration is for me hard to describe .
or what i should say much better than good .
give them a try .
just need to mix it up a bit .
we have them cut the wrap in half .
this is plenty for two people .
if you are in the area go see them .
very little cheese and was mostly pizza dough .
so do n't go for the calzone .
i have only been to one in ca twice .
prepared in a sauce with onion and potatoes .
"no processed taste , genuine home cooked meal ."
probably tomorrow for lunch or dinner .
the decor is early american roads .
what a nice place to eat .
dress code basically is business casual .
james was an excellent waiter .
now i need to rate myself .
i many of missed counting an item or two .
there are many places close to me in peoria .
this is one place i had not been .
the service was great .
i am looking forward to a repeat visit .
pretty much a sandwich shop .
when the food came it was good also .
this was not our first trip to this resturant .
they also offer a hotter version .
i had their chili verde .
there is very good <UNK> as well as quality .
you will not go away hungry .
each day i have eaten at a different place .
i decided on the blt .
the sandwich i had was very good .
if you are down town .
there was less than in inch .
and it is not someone rude arrogant person .
customer service i would rate at a d - .
one order will feed two people easy .
i do know i will be back many times .
i got a 0 piece combination plate .
he gave me a sample and i was hooked .
i was full about to pop when i left .
anyway the lee lee roll was good .
i will be back many times .
this is a very popular place .
their parking lot is jammed .
by no means great .
"then there is prime rib , ham , turkey ."
all kinds of fruits and deserts .
<UNK> you can eat till you pop .
not sure how the arrangements for the brunch work ?
my son always takes care of that part .
no problem going where we wanted .
matt came recommended by my accountant .
"therefore i put down $ 0,000 ."
i ' ve been <UNK> and dimed ever since .
is that even possible ?
in an attempt to <UNK> their food cost .
charge me more up front .
` ` order off the appetizer menu ' ' .
there ' s almost no fish on that menu .
very friendly and attentive staff .
the food was brilliant .
$ & that is some good bbq .
the atmosphere is very upbeat .
the food is incredible .
the short rib was really lean and tender .
. the grout on the tile is horrible .
this place is awesome .
go once and you will be hooked .
thai hot is hot .
one word : outstanding !
"see you again very soon , sls las vegas ."
they earned our business for life .
service was very good .
the fries reminded me of mom ' s .
this place is one of them .
this place was great .
the duck parfait was beautifully made and well tasty .
ce <UNK> pas bon mistake indeed .
"thus i gave them another chance , mistake ."
- if you can find it .
another star is the toilet .
- if you can find it .
getting there is a <UNK> .
in a well removed area .
the shops and facilities are ... expensive .
# 0.00 for a cheese <UNK> ?
it is a tourist trap .
that may entice me to visit again .
. only to be disappointed .
still needed a review .
the place has n't changed much .
". cumbersome , difficult to negotiate ."
the place still holds the relaxed and comfortable feel .
in that regard bond <UNK> is about 0/0 .
it was just a little bland and uneventful .
"quite tasty , nothing too special ."
which worked well with the steak and tomatoes .
would i have entered this bar from the street ?
. as a backup .
anita could n't eat it .
positive note : the pastry crust was perfect .
this was just across the road .
the steak was # 00 .
"this was a little underwhelming , tasteless ."
"we ate , paid and left ."
on first impressions the interior is a tad <UNK> .
the houses are grand and the shops are small .
there is a great community feel .
<UNK> i am in 0 minds about this place .
and a decent selection of vodkas .
"we visited during the week , on a wednesday ."
it could easily double up as a decent ballroom .
very well executed and great flavour .
the 0000 <UNK> was a welcome wine accompaniment .
the service was prompt and very friendly .
a nice french affair .
the food we had was very good .
many are closed on monday ' s .
it is well worth the wait .
they missed some good food .
every so often their seasonal produce menu is changed .
a couple of peroni beers suited me nicely .
this was accompanied by ... .
a big plastic bottle of <UNK> mayonnaise .
that shaved off a star in my book .
. dare i mention it .
i was never good in close condensed crowds .
this was a 00 ' s themed speakeasy .
service ran like clockwork .
my tip is to order one at <UNK> reception .
this is a local beach and not the <UNK> .
i was here for 0.0 hours .
there were some <UNK> entertaining in the main hall .
also their entrance is quite badly executed .
"burgers , nachos , hot dogs and american pancakes ."
but in edinburgh no so much .
all available fares were chalked upon the big blackboard .
no <UNK> of trying to be smart or funky .
thank you to anita for showing me this place .
you might politely tell them were to go .
at night early morning not a nice place .
as a venue i like the <UNK> .
smack in the middle of other entertainment and restaurants .
"no more , no less ."
massive tree in the main bar / restaurant ?
highly recommended and another visit is in order soon .
<UNK> cinema has all that cornered !
"not top notch , but not at all bad ."
i ' d be happy to return here .
"big , bigger , biggest ."
did i say this was large ?
their <UNK> swedish elderflower cider is a recommended <UNK> .
it was a lot and very tasty .
they have been steadily improving on offerings and service .
the buffet chef will cook what you require .
we have used this restaurant on plenty occasions .
mostly for anniversaries and special date nights .
- that ' s about it .
"if you can find it , go ."
that was a serious <UNK> .
. i tried placing it back .
"sound like any italian , right ?"
then you see the serving counter and the bar .
the place opens up is several <UNK> and areas .
the service was superb .
all girls indulged and great times became even better .
they were very busy as we expected .
"the atmosphere is a pub , a <UNK> one ."
we added a lobster course .
which is part of the venue .
cleaning the glassware was done regularly .
the show was good and <UNK> from any angle .
this visit to bar soba was a spontaneous decision .
is that what people pay for food these days ?
as a couple dining not so much .
we got some water delivered in wine bottles .
. ` ` the <UNK> ' ' .
the clock is bigger on the inside .
as it turns out : alot .
it almost feels continental .
i stumbled into this traditional - lrb - irish ?
plenty of whisky to get here .
"the concept has not changed , <UNK> happened ."
there are places that do steak to perfection .
the portion sizes are of a similar <UNK> .
liking to a mexican road cafe .
they do pizzas well .
we had some limoncello shots and made our way .
long may they brew !
some establishments need special mention .
- that is how my first impression was .
"hello raw beef , come to <UNK> ."
succulent is the word .
. why i <UNK> something very rapidly .
recommended for raw fish lovers with deep pockets .
"yes , the beer is cheap ."
fast and efficient 0 .
no nonsense approach to order taking .
i serves as an inspiration to others .
it is not the cheapest place .
"the place is welcoming , clean and unusual ."
the blue bear is a cosy place .
we were cheerfully greeted and promptly seated on arrival .
"service is prompt , efficient , confident and knowledgeable ."
i have had several company dinners and conferences here .
service is prompt and very friendly .
always add extra time for the bus to arrive .
but that is something for next time .
- lrb - well for the last 0 years .
. and of course the <UNK> flagship store .
- and that ' s about it .
the major negative points to me are : 0 .
it adds no improvement to travel time .
. sort it out transport for edinburgh .
the bar needs security guards .
it is now slightly separated using wavy glass panels .
very courteous and friendly he was .
he supplied the black pepper and cheese .
the owner / manager showed us to our table .
"which was nice , close to the heater ."
"the bloody mary was big , nice ."
unlike other visitors have found .
my experiences are very positive .
accessible for wheelchair users .
the medical center is occupied by 0 <UNK> practices .
for main i had chicken and french fries .
no more no less .
all of which i prefer over this toilet .
it is an unassuming set up .
"service is fast , courteous and unobtrusive ."
it is a gastro pub .
- not entirely my scene but enjoyable .
it just feels something is <UNK> .
they have real ales and scottish fare on offer .
"the pub is big , bright and airy ."
what would any normal restaurant do ?
as a smokers this is a luxury .
yes it is outside .
it is one of those bucket list thingies .
time for an update .
"new staff , new manager and new atmosphere ."
still pet friendly as ever - <UNK> in pubs .
nostalgia is n't what it used to be .
what makes it special ?
great way to spend a rare afternoon of sunshine .
my wife wanted a rose wine .
string fries and very succulent pork .
"tiny , crafted and well tasty bread ."
biggest gripe is the prices v portion .
the vindaloo is possibility the biggest let down .
gripe 0 : music .
it is all a very gentle affair .
a well deserved 0 stars for a first visit .
the dining area is set up on 0 levels .
"light wood , chrome and glass dividers ."
so anita had <UNK> and salmon en <UNK> .
all quite nicely presented .
this came out very promising .
there is a real organised feel to it .
the toilets are always crowded .
"the relax , dining and social area is great ."
lots of wood and seating .
out of the two i prefer <UNK> .
the table was bare save napkins and cutlery .
first time at this butcher ' s .
. most prepared on the premises .
the fries were thin cut and crisp .
as the food is delicious and succulent .
call it a gut feeling .
and everything else was well attended and presented .
- lrb - is that important ?
"better still , the detail is outstanding ."
he explains the process very well .
for this piece he supplied me a set price .
so he will not be available at black <UNK> .
service is prompt and efficient .
i had breakfast in the red squirrel .
it was delivered promptly .
so good and cheap .
what do i usually buy here ?
"not your trendy , hip bar ."
it <UNK> between sports and brown pub .
note that the burgers are n't home made .
quality of the food and condiments .
no swift return from me .
i have my <UNK> <UNK> close by in bellevue .
in all a well run pharmacy .
that is why i go there - <UNK> .
- lrb - but no <UNK> .
that stuff is in nearly every dish on offer .
with some mild sauces .
you will not be dissapointed .
i manage to while away many hours .
- just black ' m out ?
as the place is a sun trap !
ok the bar itself .
i recommend this bar for summer .
it is a massive markup .
"it shows the latest <UNK> , sometimes and indy ."
it is clean and well maintained .
you can not miss this place .
we were well attended to and promptly served .
. weird but effective .
edinburgh needs an injection of a little jungle heat .
it was roaring with spices and heat .
well done and keep it up !
"not a bad thing <UNK> , mind ."
at least not in the uk .
for that you need to go online .
<UNK> you get the <UNK> rink .
our ham hock terrine and homemade pickle was delicious .
and special drinks to represent whatever season is happening .
. does it need it ?
"cheap , no decor nor atmosphere and quite hostile ."
suffice to say i avoid this place .
. stack dim sum ah .
- bookings are possible .
new menu new review .
the pork belly dishes are second to none .
here it is <UNK> and his wings .
nice informal set up .
a menu with all varieties of wings on offer .
i started <UNK> with the 0 flame buffalo .
' ' i vaguely remember saying .
wings 0 <UNK> 0 when i found my <UNK> .
including new ones still in development .
it was a feast .
you can find the differences in every piece .
but they do it with flair and familiarity .
- why another review update ?
one obvious thing missing is wi-fi .
it ' s got 00 problems .
especially on the princes street leg of the journey .
they fix it quick mind you .
tram edinburgh is still on my watch list .
it has views over old and new town edinburgh .
the toilets are of the old victorian <UNK> variety .
"clean , practical , uniform and designed ."
"stainless steel <UNK> , simple and practical ornaments ."
the place was packed .
they are possibly a victim of their own success .
. no it has n't .
when it is bright day or early evening .
. oh wait wrong this is a cinema .
hopefully they will do something with those responses .
"their stuff is quality , proper and timeless ."
who is controlling this unbelievable disregard of traffic laws ?
as it seems no-one .
thus 0 stars from me .
"would you like it soft , medium or hard ?"
"- swedish , traditional oil or relaxing ?"
the experience is nothing i had before .
- rrb - central block of a bar .
"old fashioned , nothing wrong with that ."
it suits the building and the clientele .
quite a selection of drafts .
the voucher was for a fillet steak .
"many greens , browns and black ."
other mains were <UNK> and also a <UNK> steak .
food was well prepared and full of flavour .
table decor is minimalist and functional .
simply put they pull out all the stops .
"it works with any meat , fish or vegetable ."
the dishes are coming in think and fast .
element falls just into the latter category .
not a special cheaper version of your fares .
two thick slices of roast beef .
on closer inspection the beef was ` done ' .
yes the beef was difficult to slice and chew .
we asked for the apple crumble with custard .
"in all i expected more , a lot more ."
what makes this 0 stars ?
enjoyed the burger very much .
' ' that is what they told me .
"juicy , firm and compact ."
the bun : crunchy and light .
the filling : plentiful and tasty .
did n't know much about this new bar .
"the food is nachos , burgers and hot dogs ."
but i see why i want to visit again .
honest beer and food .
the place is a little lacking in character .
the service is mostly courteous and friendly .
once seated we were promptly helped by a <UNK> .
the sauce and filling were delicious though .
i expected more from this .
i am a chicken fan .
. like a wings place i frequent very often .
i would also like to see it done up .
we choose several dishes and a sake flight .
they have free wifi too boot .
finished sunday roast beef meal .
this was another one on my wish list .
been here twice now .
- rrb - for practical reasons .
restaurant was good and had simple fare .
a red wine and a bottle of beer .
"this is like cooking an charcoal barbecue , indoors ."
"the lighting was minimal , but well placed ."
the wine list was small but well sourced .
definitely in my top 0 for a good steak .
. in all this was a very successful <UNK> !
the <UNK> scores 0/0 on both accounts .
i finished this wonderful experience with a <UNK> coffee .
- lrb - as a side note .
"the music was not loud , more background ."
ever since it opened i am hooked .
problem is when there is a popular film on .
you not be dissapointed .
other food stuff are served but in less variety .
and the <UNK> are delicious .
what do they clean the table with ?
"they taste good , very good ."
"they introduced beef , and chicken thighs ."
- lrb - perhaps i should start one .
the main entrance to reception is in the middle .
making it quite tough to eat .
this is the 0 stars update to <UNK> .
good place and consistently high quality .
not reviewed the zoo ?
this place does well as to what it does .
"which is steaks , burgers and chicken dishes ."
and sure enough those arrived 00 min later .
now here is the thing .
perfectly cooked and extremely tender .
highly recommended and certainly worthy of revisiting often .
it runs from the edinburgh castle to holyrood palace .
merchandise and prices reflect this .
thus making this place even more touristy .
the booking went without a hitch .
lots of <UNK> ' s gin paraphernalia .
which was agreed upon .
that was a low point .
the g & t s were .
". awful , undrinkable and waaaaay to watery ."
one side red the other side green .
they have some cosy corners .
it was busy but not packed .
"the crowd is young , hip and friendly ."
the prosciutto was very good .
<UNK> apparently means mediterranean in turkish .
they do not have a website or facebook page .
i will visit here again .
this time i went to an museum after hours .
in particular the north bridge .
overlooking the glass roof of the waverley train station .
possibly even better during christmas on princes street .
"the service though efficient , was a little <UNK> ."
i chose the peppercorn and anita had her bearnaise .
. whelmed with the dish on my plate .
a solid 0 stars .
the building also houses a <UNK> hotel .
inside it is a jungle and a maze .
"first visit , they just opened today ."
the food is very tasty .
so for that 0 star off .
i got assigned a nice table beside the entrance .
after <UNK> was finished i poured and drank .
no much more to say about that .
i have been here many times over the years .
- less so the bar or food staff .
this is something i already come to expect .
- strangely enough these do change every so often .
in all an ok place to bowl .
the place is clean and the prices reasonable .
soft mint green walls and a real open kitchen .
for a chain this place is very very good !
all prepared with free range eggs and organic ingredients .
the prices are to the cheaper end of scale .
i visit here once or twice a month .
still building the shops .
the <UNK> however is <UNK> .
this bar is no exception .
so what it is part of the sheraton hotel ?
will not repeat that .
"bit of a mixed bag , but well prepared ."
a very pleasant meal in well presented surroundings .
it inspires me to explore edinburgh history .
perhaps i should not to put you off .
- rrb - salads and coleslaw sides - nah .
so lacking in flavour is a star down .
it overlooks the scottish government building .
however we have yet to have an outstanding meal .
is it the chef ?
as advised the lamb was served pink .
- not a difficult choice .
the fish tank is obviously the main focal point .
and a side dish of sticky rice .
anita had a beef curry dish with white rice .
all hello ' s and waves .
` ` what price is it ?
. go and take care of my johnson .
. <UNK> or business papers .
from 0.0 to 00.0 abv .
no food this time .
service overall has been efficient and welcoming .
i may return for a meal at some point .
the occasional visit is all right though .
the beers are reasonably priced .
load of things that glitter and are shiny .
- brilliant service and no nonsense menu .
the meal however was more an hit and miss .
this was served promptly and expertly .
what else can i say .
"innis & gunn , <UNK> expensive ."
the building is tired and the interior features questionable .
i guess it serves its purpose .
i was in and out in 00min .
some are very <UNK> and others .
this is a place of community & contrast .
old favourites are doing well .
so does the background music .
just finished a brunch with a bunch of yelpers .
it is dog friendly btw .
but nit what i expected .
very reasonably prices for draft and spirits .
the service is mixed .
i guess that is how it is .
- lrb - see what i did there ?
nothing wrong with that .
many white and mint colours .
so i think this was a bit flawed .
. i ' m not that desperate yet .
the place is big .
only a catchy phrase and some elaborate tasting notes .
- my current favourite ?
they promptly took a seat at the roaring fire .
double <UNK> pub names .
mexican themed night clubs .
i loose several hours checking out current trends .
and cheap last season things .
the place is a mess .
the place is massive .
after the major renovation this now looks fantastic .
this station as got it down to a t .
was it imported perhaps ?
. i am back here .
i confirm most of the reviews here .
but i am sure they are working on this .
this time a little more local : leith .
' and ` ` comment ã § a va ?
tables are place <UNK> throughout the restaurant .
no real colour variations and not very inviting .
well a few couple a months since the last .
dim lighting and a lot of wood .
stone floor with red brick walls .
it is close to dusk .
low candlelight and stars overlook the place .
you sit in one of the corner sofas .
that is what it feels like .
however in this case i was asking for beer .
the place is expensive .
no . 0 stars due to the prices .
thick bare stone walls and hard wooden tavern tables .
full on a mid winter wednesday evening ?
my wife kept wearing her scarf .
a wax perhaps to clean up those <UNK> areas ?
this was an ` voucher visit ' for lunch .
"there was not enough presentation , rather under presented ."
". nice , pleasing , non offensive ."
but i understand the no distractions idea of that .
"no reviews yet , shame ."
the restaurant has not been visited anytime i passed .
ca n't comment on that .
. a ship ' s lounge .
the smaller screens are what shows the difference .
this place is ` ` cracking like a peanut !
their meals are fresh and very tasty .
- lrb - without pulling you knees in tight .
. or worse <UNK> .
. but that does n't happen often and hey .
reasonable portion for the price .
"nothing stellar , but not bad ."
a diamond in the rough .
the breakfast food here is over-the-top fantastic .
great inexpensive place for breakfast .
great all american breakfast firm two about $ 00.00 .
absolutely worth the walk .
the salmon and rice bowl is not bad .
very authentic indian place .
"first of all , the service is bad ."
worst pub i ever been to .
this is the best rotisserie chicken i ever had .
strongly suggest going there .
what more can i say ?
<UNK> defines a hospital as 0 .
a similar establishment for the care of animals .
but the slots are nostalgic .
<UNK> real coins when you cash out .
the waitresses are pretty hot too .
it is certainly not worth the price .
i ' d avoid this mess at all costs .
big fan of the church .
i strongly suggest the kielbasa grinder .
you will not be sorry .
this is a must stop .
go hungry and get the southside <UNK> .
incredible combinations of smoked meats and bbq .
live music in the evening .
a must visit if you come to charlotte .
great pastries and biscuits .
what a truly unusual place .
do n't miss it if you come to charlotte .
"the pricing is great , especially during lunch ."
more broken <UNK> services .
"once seated , there was 0-0 tables open ."
the service is totally crap .
only 0:00 pm and the place was empty .
"three words , carne asada burrito ."
"family-owned business with great , down-to-earth staff ."
"great food , great service ."
the ambiance is super cool as well .
the history of aviation display is awesome .
"food , in general , was very average ."
the atmosphere was unique .
the waitress was very prompt and helpful .
the wasabi sauce was a nice touch .
great shrimp and snow crab claws .
my first impression was a good one .
i really enjoyed the wait staff .
they all paired perfectly with the fish tacos .
"for desert , they sell churros ."
"overall , i thoroughly enjoyed t & t ."
the fruit was unreal .
i would highly recommend anyone go .
you will not regret it .
awesome place stiff delicious drinks great bartenders .
they really care about what they do .
how i got to that point is another story .
it absolutely blew me away .
more on that later .
i left the casino shortly after .
the dealers were all pretty nice .
no need to say any more .
artie was prompt and courteous .
the food was equally impressive .
"strangely , this was not a bad thing ."
the corn was very tasty as well .
both food and service was below average .
the turkey burger tasted off .
the avocado tasted very stale and lacking .
the food literally took over an hour to arrive .
"the veal was tender , but definitely lacked flavor ."
the food served was decent .
friendly place with delicious sushi expertly prepared .
freshness and quality of the sushi is outstanding .
great variety as well .
the service was outstanding .
the clam chowder was ok .
well there was no collapsed pipe .
she raved about hers and said it was excellent .
def stay away from the regular fries .
overall pretty disappointed with the overall experience .
a great place for cheap drinks and food .
kristen and jason put together the bar program here .
the manger jerry is a really sweet fellow .
i would certainly come again .
it is <UNK> now to discuss the bread .
changes are mainly <UNK> based on availability .
the food is excellent .
it is an exhausting delicious list .
the cocktails are available but not very good .
i certainly look forward to having another meal here .
a great break from casino joints .
we enjoyed both the aged and standard steaks .
food is decent and cheap .
very very good pizza !
"pseudo fine-dining , great food , creative menu ."
great service with friendly staff .
tamara is a phenomenal health coach .
"sorry <UNK> ' s concord , nc ."
your mileage of course may vary .
rates are right where they should be .
the tamales were <UNK> bad .
this place completely sucks .
"this place sucks , plain and simple ."
hands down the best mexican food in phoenix !
better than carolina ' s & la <UNK> .
the green sauce is ridiculously good .
the rice is superb .
very friendly staff and great food .
"the sliders , wings and burgers are delicious ."
the lunch buffet is cheap and convenient .
"if your car needs repairs , go anywhere else ."
this is a good alternative to subway .
it ' s worth checking out for sure .
fairly average selection of drinks .
a great way to start a trip .
hell yeah i do !
and most of edinburgh i suspect .
this buffet was incredible .
it ' s pouring with rain .
right on princes street opposite the scott monument .
we had great views of the castle too .
what a fantastic selection .
we opted for the primo offer during check in .
the rooms were great .
huge in comparison to some on the strip .
"rugby , gambling and drinking in sin city ?"
wow really mc d ' s ?
"appetizers were great , i recommend the flaming cheese ."
for lunch it ' s a winner .
"had a great stay , rooms were great ."
highly unprofessional and unsatisfied .
this place is a joke .
"like i said , this place is a joke ."
very large whiskey selection .
the integrity of this is unheard of these days .
yesterday i had the reuben sandwich for $ 0.00 .
the meat was <UNK> dry and tough .
"over priced , poor value ."
area for really good pizza .
"unfortunately , they are out of business ."
noise level was adequate enough to carry on conversation .
thanks <UNK> town center dental group !
the view is main reason this gets 0 stars .
you wo n't regret it .
a very different menu and it was great .
i had a wagyu ny strip on the bone .
it was simply amazing .
the <UNK> is amazing as is the lamb kabob .
rao ' s was perfect .
"from the food , to the service ."
but the rooms are inconsistent .
one complaint and i was <UNK> for the evening .
"the food is so fresh , forget the chains ."
blt and a sam adams on a beautiful day .
the food was excellent .
my wife ordered the gnocchi .
the pate was strange .
this was after nearly an hour in the place .
her fries were cold .
"my fires were hot , and they were delicious ."
"not bad , just bland ."
one of my go to chinese take out place !
only one or two other tables .
just way too short .
the whole thing just seems <UNK> .
oh and stay away from the gross breakfast buffet .
' ' or ` ` keep your core tight !
and when will nutritional facts be available ?
this is a great butcher shop and market .

remember your in casa grande .
"what can i say , its another chain restaurant ."
"good portions , and the fish is fresh ."
nice features and fairly quick for what it is .
wireless and wired internet is an extra charge .
the most impressive part was the dessert area .
see the other review for more details .
i recommend the carnitas and the jerk chicken .
location was built out perfectly to the french theme .
the two cooks were chinese .
the panoramic rooms live up to their name sake .
the halibut was amazing .
avoid at all costs .
- lrb - pun <UNK> - rrb - .

"like many other yelpers , kick ass food ."
"a solid hotel , but nothing to rave about ."
"short on menu , long on taste ."
"they guide us in , and take us up ."
there is an <UNK> sense of luxury .
our family absolutely loves this place .

we go there about once a week .
<UNK> lincoln has a loyal customer in me .
"this location is closed , as of 0/00 / 00"
this place was a huge waste of time !
awesome and great staff .
i on the other hand left using some <UNK> .
last night and had an excellent time .
great atmosphere to accompany the tasty drinks .
had a good breakfast buffet .
a little pricey but this is a hotel restaurant .
"with orange juice refills , it was worth it ."
my buddy had the fried chicken and waffles .
you are directly below the flight path .
the units seemed to have been rushed when built .
the staff changes almost weekly it seems .
<UNK> comes off as a prick .
the area is not a good area .
you are just north of the 000 .
the location : - 0 stars .
"that being said , the food : 0 stars ."
most professional and awesome trainers you could ever meet .
one of the best steakhouses off the strip .
this is an award winning dish in my eyes .
fantastic lunch with the pain sandwich .
best ice cream in charlotte .
and the sides were pretty good too .
the best made order sandwiches in town .
the food and environment are both really good .
probably ca n't go wrong with any of them .
a must order 0 .
brussel sprouts : the yonaka effect .
seemed like a greek joint without falafels .
price was standard and worth every penny .
i mentioned my <UNK> efforts to reduce carb intake .
many a shirt have been ruined by myself there .
"same great taste , less ruined shirts ."
"service was friendly , fast , and efficient ."
others at my table werent nearly as impressed .
they are much <UNK> than i am .
the burger was quite simply a disappointment .
not sure how that is possible with those ingredients .
you know the main photo for this place ?
the food here is very good .
the ingredients were fresh and everything tasted nice .
again the ingredients were fresh and everything tasted great .
spoiler alert : i was right .
here are the downsides : 0 .
get your mind out the gutter .
the first in my series of jury duty reviews .
where do i begin with the downsides of this ?
the <UNK> dull periods of waiting ?
the insulting $ 00 a day pay scale ?
"so yeah , 0 stars ."
i ' ve had almost everything on the menu .
so i stick with medium for the most part .
service was top notch for my takeout .
what more really needs to be said here ?
this is a true test of my nature .
"well , that and the non buffet prices ."
it ' s truly shameful .
it actually might have gotten into the negatives .
what ' s my next move here ?
not too long later the food arrived .
<UNK> does this without fail every time .
"<UNK> , why even bother ?"
this is a master at work in the kitchen .
good god was this delicious .
"yeah sure , we all do right ?"
"anyway , i have these days ."
"the food is always decent , but rarely spectacular ."
the regular with some pepperoni is simple and delicious .
enter the tree of life .
"so yeah , i played it safe ."
a <UNK> to capriottis throne has emerged .
respect due to pizza hut .
i get the hype now .
<UNK> and richie <UNK> days would approve .
"ah , the power of a sandwich ."
a bargain at $ 0.00 .
it seemed overcooked and not very well seasoned .
the tuna was perfectly seared and seasoned .
another of my jury duty stops .
it was decent i guess .
first and 0nd visit i got the thali .
seriously i ' m blown away right now .
onto the burger : pretty run of the mill .
such a delicate game the burger ordering process .
had a bit of a hiatus from writing reviews .
i ' m a charred chicken connoisseur .
0 - rrb - coca cola freestyle .
this is n't a thing anymore .
the best part is double point sundays .
another win for the common man .
"yup , make it 0 ."
bone marrow for president .
we both ordered the comme ã <UNK> a burger .
this is unheard of .
how does one screw up chicken fingers ?
do people eat those ?
the hotter the better .
they usually are hot and fresh as well .
i could bathe in this stuff .
currently saving up for an engagement ring .
bring me the good stuff .
opens late and closes early .
only go here if you are absolutely forced to .
i mean this in the nicest way possible .
my list of recommended food : 0 .
i can confirm this is closed .
"i was , uh , just passing by ."
the first portion we received of naan was excellent .
review w / in a review - rrb - .
- rrb - the best in las vegas .
"as you all probably know , arrowhead is disgusting ."
i asked and they confirmed in a friendly manner .
first the soup arrived .
the small is large and the large is <UNK> .
- rrb - been here <UNK> .
what do they say about the first time ?
ended up batting . 000 after that <UNK> .
or maybe it was n't even cooked yet .
the egg roll was fairly average .
this is who you ' re dealing with here .
turns out the joke was on me all along .
"have been here twice now , both for lunch ."
yeah that half and half plan earlier ?
duck fried rice - 0 stars .
papaya salad - 0 star .
0 + 0 / 0 = 0 .
"yeah , 0 stars ."
"hmmmm , this is turning promising ."
high expectations can be a killer .
thai curry sausages were all good - lrb - !
i was n't prepared for this .
"uh , yeah i do ."
"until <UNK> curry arrived , that is ."
first item of note was no brown rice .
0 - rrb - that pic i posted above ?
0 - rrb - no eggroll .
where ' s doc brown when you need him ?
this review is long overdue .
my friend ' s seafood madness was $ 00 .
"the iced tea , even unsweetened , tasted delicious ."
<UNK> : this should be a 0.0 .
my apologies to the owner / staff .
as you can tell i hate pork .
the world will soon be ours .
you couldnt mess this broth up if you tried .
odds are it ' ll still be delicious .
as an added bonus the service is incredible .
why does this taste good ?
who on earth came up with this ?
is this an episode of chopped ?
many have waxed <UNK> about the <UNK> of burritos .
this is not a small portion either .
"check , check , check , check ."
0 stars just for the burrito ?
what a great looking place .
this was further confirmed by this <UNK> visit .
"so yeah , herbal salad : freaking amazing ."
the food was much more pleasing in every way .
first off there was a mountain of food .
<UNK> turned out to be bland pieces of chicken .
it ' s a <UNK> .
and then you will probably kick my ass .
a fine start for frijoles i must say .
it was <UNK> if that word even exists .
then came the gyro .
prices were reasonable and service was friendly and efficient .
the cheesesteak though might be too good to resist .
this is not the case .
best chinese food in las vegas .
"yeah , i ca n't call it ."
oh and veggie kofta curry .
"melt in your mouth , well seasoned ."
this is one tricky place to review .
is that something to hold against a restaurant ?
be careful on ordering those with heavy spice .
no more secrets for me <UNK> !
yes even the post office on pebble and bermuda .
last but not least was the price .
bread used with this ?
nothing worth docking any stars .
<UNK> my last sentence of the first paragraph .
fortune favors the bold .
you should do the same - rrb - .
i dont know if i really like chinese food .
"nope , just the big white guy ."
your guess is as good as mine .
take that for what it ' s worth .
salt and pepper pork chops .
perhaps i had too high of expectations ?
the next time i tried the bbq combo plate .
worst visual of the year ?
service on both visits was fast and pleasant .
went with two salmon entrees instead .
the meal was a delight .
lately my vice is the cheesesteak with hot peppers .
"yeah , they won the lazy <UNK> of war ."
nearly all of them <UNK> 0.0- 0 stars .
the yellow curry with pork .
this is what i ' m talking about .
this is a must order .
"first off , my first review since becoming elite !"
"okay sit down , i have to work here ."
i ate with reckless abandon .
frustration point # 0 .
it ' s worth poor <UNK> ' s demise .
this was a heck of an introduction .
number 0 : hainan chicken and rice .
this is a tough one to write .
' ' the way angelo did .
then i ate there .
started with the sake sangria .
i felt <UNK> to be honest .
no means no <UNK> .
i said somewhere in between medium and spicy .
the quality of each individual component was excellent .
actually opening the entree led to more disappointment .
i suppose i should start talking about the food .
you have to try their espresso .
or should i say caramel ?
did i mention their espresso ?
very typical <UNK> american-style chinese food .
do n't recommend at all .
below average thai green curry .
strike 0 : blasting death metal music .
strike 0 : flies .
not a fan of their brewed or pour-over coffee .
"nice , casual environment for lunch or dinner ."
no checking in to see how things are going .
the bed and sheets were indeed lux as well .
so why only 0-0 stars ?
such was the case here .
so the cards were stacked against them .
"that being said , this place was not good ."
"excellent , excellent , excellent ."
"yeah a bit , but well worth it ."
very friendly with great coffee and customer service .
great service and of course awesome chips and salsa .
what a very pleasant surprise .

huge improvement over last time .
the french onion soup was very good .
not bad for the price .

the second time was to grab some breakfast .

the food was orgasmic .
service was great and the food is greater .

this place is over rated .
"the lamb was overcooked , essentially like cardboard ."
the gyro plate did not come with a pita .
this meal cost $ 00 with tax .
a total rip off .

the employees have been friendly on each visit .

this place is racist .

the beef is juicy and the sauce is good .
the wings are hands down the best in town .
service is pretty bad some days though .
what more can i say .
repairs were completed within their quoted timeframe .
the problem happened again after it was fixed .
i would highly recommend these guys .
check in on yelp to get the free flan .
"aged cheddar , multi grain bread , the best !"
"the chicken is good , and the service consistent ."
it is always good .
i usually order the grilled chicken pecan salad .

wish someone would have done the same for me .
"coffee was good too , and refills came promptly ."
no problems with the service .
horrible pizza as well as service .
"great spot , nice decor ."
food arrived on time and hot .
. the staff lack common courtesy .
"fresh sushi , great flavors , great service ."
baked king crab roll anyone .
ca n't say enough about this place .
really nothing you can say wrong about the place .
"dessert menu looked incredible , perhaps a touch pricey ."
just not a good place to eat .
<UNK> the times they are actually not open .
bottom line : a pleasant surprise !
"clean , quick , quaint but modern ."
so in fact the net result was in line .
and did i say my burger was near perfect ?
bringing a group on friday !
a no brainer place to stop for something sweet .
cheers wow - great live jazz venue .
desperately needed in az and boy did they deliver !
yup it ' s true .
at reasonable prices to boot .
which may or may not cause infections and reactions .
not just typical burgers .
they have many burger choices .
the production was put together well .
i first went to one in san diego .
i recommend getting reservations .
this place stays packed .
average buffet decent food .
finally stayed here and wasnt impressed .
i love classic cars .
other wise i would skip out on this attraction .
very nice views of the strip .
this place is very good .
this place was terrible .
my wife and i stayed here years ago .
i have been here 0 times .
there are always passes in ny ny somewhere .
but they play good music .
this place is a hidden gem .
i dug in and cleaned the plate .
not as packed here .
my wife an i had a good time here .
it is not for everybody .
if street people bother you i would n't go .
also try to park at the golden nugget .
i like this place .
i have been going here for a few years .
let alone in the same area .
it was done pretty quick .
the ribs were pretty good .
the hot link was spicy but not hot .
mashed potatoes where a little better .
over priced and over rated .
the bbq i would try again .
nice place to get a picture .
this is not one of them .
it is cheap price .
this place food quality is below denny ' s .
this place is pretty cool .
i played it to the end with my beer .
like a old school dave and busters .
wedding was here every one stayed here .
almost $ 000 for a family of 0 .
but this place is cool .
it is great here .
even better that the wynn encore .
hotwire has deals here also .
breakfast lunch or dinner .
i like this place .
the wife on the other hand is another story .
"i would stay again , my wife would not ."
its a basic club .
the club is kinda on the small side .
so it stays packed .
normal vegas price drinks .
friendly bartenders good decor .
if you do not have kids dont go .
the tower rooms are much better .
beer is ok for the strip .
food is a 0 stars .
it was deep dish pizza with pepperoni and sausage .
i liked the pizza alot .
many places do new york style pizza .
i wanted deep dish .
not just hot but hot as hell .
there was a cool view of downtown fremont .
i was in there looking for air conditioning vents .
the bar was ok .
nothing real special besides the view of the fremont .
that is another plus .
more urban less top 00 ' s .
also the omelets you can have them make .
besides that every thing is average .
this place is great .
good home style cooking .
this place is ok .
the good tickets go quick .
then come here and see how they compare .
also check the las vegas magazine .
if you can get the upgraded rooms go .
the upgraded rooms look and sleep nice .
the older ones are shabby .
i would avoid them .
this is a nice cheap hotel north strip .
guess i was wrong .
check in was quick .
be 00 minutes early .
headed to the strip and had a good time .
a little too much of a good time .
wished that presentation was later .
then they start calling names .
my wife holds me back and takes over .
they tried to sell us on the location .
long story short no sell .
i know the game you guys play .
i have been to 0 time shares before .
he tried to sell us for about an hour .
i am a pretty nice guy .
my suggestion is dont buy anything from these guys .
it doesnt look <UNK> <UNK> belongs down town .
my wife and i liked this place .
quick service good pizza .
i like this place .
chris is the best .
both times i was very satisfied .
i brought my wife and her friend .
i looked it up on yelp first .
it had 0 stars out of 000 people .
long story short it was my alternator .
after checking yelp i came to this place .
i should have checked yelp before i came here .
i got in the club quick .
they have fire coming from the sky .
decent girl to guy ratio .
or i should say the sliding door .
the toilet it right there in front of it .
that was weird water all over the place .
over all i had a good time there .
the figures look very life like .
every one should check this out .
this place was pretty good .
from what i remember .
the asian pot stickers .
it had high flying acrobatics with water .
the performers come from the roof hooked to cable .
happy hour sunday the pizzas are 0 dollars .
that is half price .
the dough is imported from italy .
this is not your typical olive garden food .
i am redoing them now .
that came out much better .
"my wife loved the mojitos , drinks were good ."
may give this place another try .
maybe the food will be better next time .
i usually get a skillet with meat and potatoes .
many locals know about this place .
it stays busy for a reason .
stayed at stratosphere with my family .
has all your basic amenities check in was average .
you get to go up the tower free .
more if you want to ride roller coasters .
how things have changed .
this is the old pasta palace .
this station casino has both .
not as good as ghost bar .
it was cool to see .
but it was dead .
a younger crowd might not like it <UNK> .
i have eatin at several better buffets similarly priced .
i rather eat at the orleans <UNK> cantina .
i like this place .
on on the roof top .
normal high vegas priced drinks .
just another average buffet on the strip .
they used to have $ 00 dollar rooms .
i took my wife here on a budget trip .
even now with resort fees it is cheap .
it is right off the strip .
this isnt for everybody though .
if some things bother you do not stay there .
my wife and i liked it .
i paid 00 to be up front .
over priced m & m s .
the cheap good fried food .
the good lounge acts .
the quarter game machine .
this place was great .
the price was cheap .
the food was average .
the price to me was insane .
that was the smallest steak i ever seen .
my wife got <UNK> .
this place is probably better suited for tourist .
nice free attraction that is now gone .
just walk up and take a couple pics .
guess this is just another sign of the times .
it took the place of the sahara .
an industrial look to the rooms .
i stayed in the story tower .
which is kinda a trip .
similar to palace station which is also annoying .
i helped a couple people figure it out .
having attendants by the elevator helps a little .
some say it is not good for kids .
and kinda boring also .
i like the fresh chips with the 0 sides .
the food is always good .
this is the old don <UNK> .
i asked what had changed .

flat screen tv properly placed .
they are hard as a rock .
this place is good if the weather permits .
its all out doors .
0 dollar quesadillas ok fine .
add 0 dollar for beans .
i have no problem paying extra for good food .
the problem i had was the hotel room location .
it is far from parking .
this one was not the case .
even further if you park your own car .
it never got to that setting .
i like this place alot .
this place has a nice pool .
hotwire has deals on this place .
even big girls got love which is a surprise .
good home feeling there .
this place is huge .
the hotel rooms where a little above average .
the signature is much better .
no matter what i order it is always great .
i usually go to the one in san diego .
old machines where cash still drops when you win .
best view from a club hands down .
my wife and i loved this place .
this place is all hype .
"found this place which looked ok , bad move ."
service was slow and spotty .
the atmosphere was loud but in a good way .
both were very good .
shelby our <UNK> was excellent .
they do a regional burger for every location .
the wynn is the very best for the price .
"the steak is , of course , spectacular ."
well worth a try for anyone .
"a must try , you wo n't be sorry ."
they ' ll do all kinds of custom orders .
"really nice hotel , location near airport ."
they said it will take till next week .

the selection is better here .
the bar had a great feel to it .
security was great along with the servers .
<UNK> <UNK> steak & pork kimchi were amazing .
i check out this <UNK> thai chinese restaurant .

eddie chose rack of ribs with all the fixins .
my dish was excellent as well .
great food good prices awesome waitress autumn .
get ryan as your waiter .
you will smile after <UNK> first bite friendly service .
what more can u ask for in a restaurant .
the appetizers we had were very good as well .
all the pastas are made in-house .
my wife had the cavatelli and she loved it .
the flavors were incredible .
"i liked it , my wife did n't ."
the flavors are very concentrated and strong .
they seem to want to cover all the bases .
i should have declined .
we asked to move to another table further away .
the meat looked like leather .
turn it on electric are pro ' s .
these guys make sure the job is complete .
i had them repair a flat .
that ' s <UNK> customer service .
i have eaten here a bunch of times .
i especially like to go for a late breakfast .
the <UNK> and breakfast quesadilla are great .
dated but reasonably clean .
the sauce on top was ... the bomb !
this place is legit .
you ca n't be disappointed by this place .
they have great live music playing the best oldies .
it will fill you up .
<UNK> is exactly what i expected it to be .
excellent new addition to the nw vegas eateries .
"that aside , it was time to order ."
"pick it up , bite , and enjoy ."
that was my first red flag .
but that ' s where i stopped being impressed .
never a bad thing .
very good food and portion size for the $ .
bang for your buck all the way .
"good flavors , good ingrediants ."
most of the biz is take out .
went there for the lunch special .
super friendly family run <UNK> restaurant .
you have a choice of lamb or vegetarian .
but ai n't the worst .
save your money instead for another pizza place .
just visited here recently and i was severely disappointed .
poor gym with poor lack of customer service .
the mac and cheese was dry and nasty .
these guys are just amazing !
' ' that is a direct quote .
the burger was just bad .

<UNK> sucks big time ... service sucks also .
overall i was very pleased .
a bit thick but still worth the price .
waitress with an attitude .
the food and food service was outstanding .

"finally , the room was n't ridiculously expensive ."
the staff was great .
great restaurant in the tradition of great steakhouses .
"food was excellent , staff great ."

moving on to the wrap made things even worse .
maybe the breakfast is better ?
"management , get your shit together ."
this place was awesome .
this is a nightclub inside palazzo resort .
strongly advise checking this place out .
the act is a lot of fun .
"all in all , a terrific restaurant ."
we left nothing to chance and did extensive research .
"firstly , you have to start with the view ."
head and arms <UNK> all over the place .
show a little restraint in your <UNK> .
"got in line early , around 00ish ."
last problem was the music .
i got the braised short ribs .
this was one of those meals .
"firstly , i booked the room using 0 methods ."
both the coffee and tea were very good .
is it as good as caesars ?
"anyway , this place is unbelievably good ."
you wo n't regret it .
now ... lets face it .
sat at the bar and ordered food there .
burger was thick and juicy and cooked right .
"but , there are better burgers nearby ."
there ' s simply too much going on .
"mystere , as the original , is very different ."
back on topic - the music .
the staff at the mgm is really friendly .
first day was for exploring the strip .
but the location is superb .
the fish fry was simply outstanding .
one of the best in madison .
ended up being charged $ 000.00 .
i have insurance coverage through my auto ins .
other than that the car was ok outside .
back to the insurance waiver scam .
$ 00.00 per day .
i told them i was mislead and lied to .

this is my current favorite sushi spot .
the rides are awesome without a doubt .
"not terrible , but not up to par either ."

i ' m from texas .
"' ' nope , but his wife is ."

how about an overall worthless experience .
the scottsdale location on the other hand was terrible .

"the food was good , not great ."
call and make a reservation for the tempura tables .
my buddy ' s were the same way .
had the smoked pork outlaw burger .
food is top notch .
prices are very good .
this was one of them .
"that is absurd , to say the least ."
an especially good deal as well .
"she , alone , is reason to go back ."
overall a fairly good dining experience .
the bbq was tasty and the sides were delicious .
it is very forward in the flavour profile .
know what you are getting into .
this place is a gimmick .
typical pint is $ 00.00 .
she then let me sip the beer to confirm .
we can always grab a beer somewhere else .
"great food , service and ambience - perfect ."
no i ' m not over <UNK> either .
cici ' s pizza is ok .
it ' s cheap pizza for lunch .
their price matches their quality .
"service was pretty good , prices are fair ."
their breads are great .
but the food is good and service is fine .
"dinner was good , but not great ."
this place encourages it .
you wo n't see that anywhere else .
this place is a joke !
pops on decatur is far better than this place .
their buffet is horrible .
"well at 0:00 , no one showed up ."
at 0:00 i called no answer .
you definitely earned your 0 stars .
that ' s a <UNK> sign .
their sushi rolls were avg .
would i get a dozen doughnuts again ?
"no excuses , no language barriers !"
this place still has lots of great items .
"not great , certainly not bad ."
their <UNK> prices are probably the best in town .
the place was packed .
so let ' s get on with the review .
they just do n't want to serve it .
i do n't plan on goin back anytime soon .
there are far better sushi bars in vegas .
their fish is very fresh .
this location like most others was very busy .
the soups were ok at best .
omg this place is great .
their ready made foods are incredible .
wow i was disappointed here for some reason .
he has no competition nearby either .
thankfully it was a very short trip .

this was a very interesting place .
typically i prefer albertsons over smiths .
i have never liked how the layout of smiths .
this place is going down hill more and more .
the beef was very good .
lowes has a few things home depot does n't .
service is a little better though here .
<UNK> is good on some things and not others .
is this place the best ?
but it ' s far from being the worst .
you wo n't be disappointed .
wow it was good .
ok fine no big deal .
i walked in and placed a togo order .
this was my first visit here .
"food was fresh , hot and served quick ."
this place vs aloha kitchen .
i ' ve never had a bad meal here .
i never felt stupid or talked down to .
the server was very nice as well .
i have no real complaints .
they need to liven it up a bit .
portion size was good .
so people are comin here for a reason .
"great selection , food , prices , great soups ."
they may seem empty but not today .
they are also way over priced .
"but overall , i liked this place ."
the people that work there are very nice .
"it ' s very small , only 0 tables ."
i love comin to this place .
both cookies were fantastic .
it ' s very average .
this was my first visit to the restaurant .

both times i was the only person there .
the food is the main issue here .
wow it had <UNK> flavor to it .
it was just simply <UNK> .
there ' s a few problems here .
0 out of 00 .
now comparison # 0 .
here ' s the issues i have .
they even have a very good lunch menu .
the <UNK> is old and worn though .
i could care less if i ever go back .
these rolls are normally $ 0.00 everywhere else .
the steaks are tough too .
home depot always has someone around to help .
it ' s definitely not a bad place though .
the food is really good though .
not a good thing with fried chicken .
if only zero stars was possible .
the staff ' s only response ?
skip the barrio hype .
is it a little rough around the edges ?
yes but all the more charming imo .
this place had some damn amazing pizza .
i ended up drinking most of the <UNK> .
service was prompt and courteous .
you will not be disappointed .
i will be a regular customer here .
gave this a couple of tries .
"i suggest the chili mint chicken , absolutely delicious ."
drinks are decently priced but cocktails could be stronger .
overall this is a decent place for karaoke .
service is above satisfactory .
<UNK> is very friendly .
you guys are lucky .
carne asada fries are pretty damn good .

recipe for success : a 00 oz .
my wife and daughter loved their vegetarian option .
unique selections with great ingredients for everything i saw .
learned later they have received some national attention .
based on my experience they deserve yours .
the food holds it ' s own .
owners are vikings fans !
the small space on the top floor gets crowded .
there is breathing room outside on the balcony .
the bar mixes drinks at an affordable price .
great place to take friends .
i valet parked my truck .
other than that it is a great breakfast place .
the price is right .
great value at an ok place .
inside there were oversized chairs around the fireplace .
there were a couple hidden rooms .
the balcony provided a nice view .

amazon has earned my business .
normally everything is great .
how hard is it to read a ticket ?
. - rrb - the issues were corrected immediately .
` ` no problem ' ' the girl says .
she was n't even polite or courteous about it .
they are experts in this field .
. excellent job again guys .
this place is all around mediocre .
this is the famous montreal smoked meat place .
nothing but a bar and a bunch of tables .
the fries were fine as well .
just a 00 $ plate of noodles .
great food at a reasonable price .
nothing unusual about the menu .
but certainly not worth the trip .
read some of the other reviews before going .
". first , the good stuff ."
read the reviews on yelp before picking nori .

"fantastic horchata , check ."
a really cool place to see when in vegas .
best burger joint ever .
well done rio mirage !
my burrito was muy grande and bursting with deliciousness !
the calzone was awesome !
the absolutely worst service ever .
delicious and unique asian spin on burgers .

i would expect a better quality of beef .
they are also less expensive and worth the price .
"classic brazilian bbq , best quality meat !"
"but when i do , i prefer los reyes ."
or if your food is this damn good .
this review has been a long time coming .
butters is no exception .
i never leave butters feeling <UNK> or unsatisfied .

menu is diverse and plating is spectacular .
we contacted bulwark after finding their deal on yelp .
this place was amazing with great service .
our server <UNK> was great .
i highly recommend this nice place .
best carwash in the valley by far .

best ribs in vegas !
microbrews for $ 0.00 and they are really good .
"try it , you ' ll be hooked ."
here ' s how it went down .
"$ 00 for guys , $ 00 for girls ."
they now sell 00oz <UNK> .
the food is great .
large portions and a unique way of presenting it .
blue martini is a joke .
my suggestion is to get there real early .
by 00:00 the place was packed .
not great but not bad .
the best crabs in vegas .
this place is true to its heritage .
there was not much chicken in the sandwich .

the beer and drink selection was very nice .
food was creative and very tasty .

will probably not come back again .
nothing really to brag or complain about .
service was decent as well .
great honest food and french baked goods .
good food selection ... good staff ... good value !
"both are modern , open and bright ."
"once again , american express has outdone themselves ."

dang was our chef and very friendly and professional .
. very tasty food somewhat different .
it was very good in fact excellent .
oysters specials on thursday <UNK> .
service was great found my new home !
so i order the chicken mole burrito plate .
looks good and was excellent .
in fact the tacos was very good also .
although the quality of the food seemed significantly lower .
biscuits in cold gravy .
the price was n't bad at all .
other then that the staff are friendly .
this place is the winner thus far .
ability to create your own burger .
"lard , bacon fat , butter , etc . ."
all far better options .
there in lies the problem with this place .
what time did we get drinks ?
finally came the entrees .
ordered the salmon rockefeller .
which is described as being ` stuffed ' .
arrived and were promptly seated at an awesome table .
"like cure , a modern atmosphere ."
both were fantastic and very well presented .
but the pacing is slow .
what i received : a burger .
with a full mound of fries .
great place for lunch .
apparently a change in chef is partly to blame .
the ` ` <UNK> ' ' from the app .
same story with the sausage platter .
$ 00 for 0 pieces of sausage ?
and what kind of kielbasa is that ?
"hostess was great , service was adequate ."
really a strong 0.0 .
beyond that - wow .
my review covers sunday brunch .
eggs and biscuits were well done .
the bad : bland .
not likely to return .
that about covers it .
food comes out quick .
you know what i ' m talking about .
caprese salad and chicken saltimbocca service : adequate .
toppings were virtually non-existent .
saltimbocca - pretty good .
probably the most enjoyable thing i ordered .
a solid and above average burger for certain .
a 0.0 would probably nail it .
something has changed over time .
spread them out evenly please .
atmosphere and service were great .
i could live without it .
fries were fries - nothing special .
yet another place that cooks with <UNK> oil .
nyc prices in a pittsburgh market .
"ok , rant over ."
this is where my second point comes off .
life of a fitness professional .
the joe was probably my next favorite .
tables are n't cramped too tightly together at least .
best burger in the ` burgh - hands down !
"/ bbq sauce based one again , also excellent ."
i hope this is not the new standard .
this place is in a great location .
management is not paying attention .
good for 0 out of 0 .
"food for server , bad for customer and business ."
this place is a train wreck .
it should be renamed neglect .
until then ... stay away from this place .
it ' s hard to find guys like bob .
<UNK> does things the way any good business should .
they only fix what ' s broken .
everyone seems more interested in the quick buck .
thank you and keep up the good work .
i wish i recorded my visit .
now they have a 0 way conversation going .
taste was above average .
this place is awesome .
job very well done .
clear looking and very smooth tasting .
we will be back without question .
started with the fish taco and that was awesome .
great atmosphere and good beer though .
let me start off with what great owners here .
favorite hawaiian place to eat in vegas .
"great food , fair price , and good ambience ."
it is my favorite korean bbq spot in vegas .
it ' s always very tasty .
last night i had a craving for singapore noodle .

great spot for a truly unique hot dog .
give it a try .
time to go to a reputable provider .
"great neighborhood bar , i live up the street ."
the staff and owners are very welcoming to everyone .
"great food , limited menu but lots of favorites ."
they validate parking but i am disabled .
they even installed self closing hinges .
i could not be more satisfied .
the pricing is not low ball but very competitive .
i moved here from nj last july .
"the reubens are great , meatloaf and chicken dishes ."
there are 0 and diners in 0 states now .
all brought promptly and the way i like them .
will be back many times again .
re : rachel m . ' s comments .
the landscaping is redone and updated .

the lunch service sucked on a sunday afternoon .
just your typical casa grande rude customer service .
the brisket was nice and tender and very flavorful .
im adding two thumbs up to my 0 stars !
good staff and fast service .
my problem was that food was not that great .
just a bit skimpy for my tastes .
the <UNK> was tender and not rubbery at all .
an excellent lunch meal .
"try it out , you wont be disappointed ."
a major food safety concern .
even at a sit down restaurant .
. amazing selection of high quality foods .
four hour wait which was tough .
stay away from volvo of phoenix at all cost .
this dealership is a nest of unethical scam artists .
they are either <UNK> or <UNK> scam artists .
my wife said the same of her meal .
my daughter thought her salad was fine .
great happy hour offerings .
this location provided a great example of disconnected employees .
want inexpensive audio equipment ?
both meals were amazingly great tasting !
experience varies <UNK> depending on staff .
<UNK> always fairly enjoyable .
great venue for the phoenix area .
"it ' s a joke , really ."
food quality borders on average and below average .

the jalapenos were hotter than <UNK> .
this was an enjoyable experience through and through .
asian guys i tell ya ... .
best chinese bbq place in vegas .

always serving up alaska king crab legs for dinner .
the rice to the sushi never quite tastes right .
my wife and i love this place .
good rooms at a great price .
always clean and helpful .
the mussels with red sauce and bread is excellent .
old school interior the way i like it .
"great building , food , service and location ."
had a root canal done here today .
food is ok depending on what you order .
mike and aj at the bar are great .
what was constant in other reviews was the service .
very disappointed with the front of the house .
"bread plates were provided , then breads were brought ."
i ' ll keep watching the damn shows though !
last night was another poor experience .
drive here regardless of where you live .
the detail is <UNK> awesome !
then the taste - wow .
the place was more than 0/0 empty .
my steak was ok .
this did n't come close .
life is too short for a bad meal .
this place is different .

ca n't help you .
this is where the disappointment began .
san tan pool services has beyond past our expectations !
love the classic wood fired pizza .
had the new york new york .
agree with other reviewers - this place rocks .
lifetime value of customer appears to be alien concept .
its been impossible to get in all week .
chopped peanuts look like chopped garlic or onion .
view was excellent as was service from most staff .
you walk forever from place to place to elevators .
my skin feels soft and it removed <UNK> .
"or better yet , do you hate ducks ?"
they also have one hell of a wine list .
surprisingly good beer bar .
this place has one of the coolest <UNK> ever .
it was like something out of game of <UNK> .
so bring a friend ... or 0 .
"seriously , avoid at all costs ."

<UNK> is a pretty big waste of time .
it was that much food .
served in a broth with a ton of vegetables .

not sure what to think about this place .
the place looks clean .

. but something is missing .
to me its uninspiring .
the bbq sauce was somewhat sparse .
the slaw was slaw .
. just like i have at every other place .
as for the meat itself .
as for the bbq .
. its just meat with nothing beyond that .
. yes as the other review said .
"00 % , 00 % , 00 % ."
. thats alot for just a take out joint .
. its a basic bbq joint .
was great pizza back then .
i stopped coming here months ago .
. another slice of pepperoni .
. was ok on pep .
. seems a bit half hearted in her job .
happy i stopped by .
. missed the taste of the pizza .
. always a hit and miss it seems .
. or maybe just bad luck on my part .
. ordered 0 slice peperoni special .
... came out burnt ... sent it back .
. second order ... hardly any cheese .
other had dollar size areas of no cheese .
. what happened to this place ?

. first 0 times only got beer .
. looked very good when it arrived .
. perfect ... now comes the cold .
. said making fresh fries .
. these were worse than original .
manager just now walked up while making this review .
. very nice person .

. i see they are trying .
. but they need a basic cook .
. will now have to take my business there .

. seems like they really care about the product .
now it ' s a large operation .
. always stop by when in area .

crap fries and small drink .
". 00 % , 00 % , 00 % ."
the italian is always great .
and who does n't love crappy toys ?
they have them work in the sports book .
fatty <UNK> i . e <UNK> ?
besides the <UNK> this place is n't so bad .
so bottom line i like the aria sports book .
their lunch specials are nothing short of incredible .
now that ' s an impressive restaurant .
over all a great place to eat .
the staff is great .
the greens do need a little maintenance .
"just a great place , never disappointed ."
"' ' fail , no they dont ."
my wife loves coming here .
reasonable prices as well .
` ` why did n't you take it back ?
the meal was incomplete .
no soy sauce blend like other places .
"i ordered crawfish , cajun fries , and oysters ."
the hot n juicy special seasoning was n't bad .
it had potatoes at least .
the service was extremely slow .
next came the meal .
thanks for $ 00 worth of shit .
very nice little setting in old town .
had fish of the day and the schnitzel .
looks like a tourist trap but excellent poutine !
finally a five star southwestern restaurant .
"it was good , but dated ."
but some would say that ' s the appeal .
i should have asked the price before ordering .
the server was excellent as well and very attentive .
in terms of food the octopus was really good .
"the sandwiches , pasta and salads are great ."
his burger place is good .
the prices are over the top .
vegas has many better choices .
"clean , neat , quiet and outstanding service ."
solid place in a great location .
at <UNK> you are part of a team .
will be back on future visit to vegas .
"again , bourdain does not disappoint ."
not very creative but very tasty .
clark thought the duck pancake was so-so .
clark found it very dry and unseasoned .
"basics : great service , very good food ."
this place is affordable and good .
i ' ll be back soon !
"for starters , it is somewhat loud ."
go there for the quintessential las vegas prime rib .
a great place to stay on the strip .
just a rectangular pool with lounges and cocktail service .
however our waitress was pretty bad .
"really , who puts that in front of someone ."
then i had the singapore seafood noodles .
"good food , not pricy ."
this gym is great .
tons of machines and all the latest equipment .
the gym itself is 0 star .
new clients seem more important than existing clients .
will not be ignored again .
booked appointment online waste of time .
good food but not so good service .
i ' m not a pulp guy .
the business owner reached out to explain .
shows an excellent level of care .
i put in my order at 00:00 .
that is just unacceptable for a chicken wrap .
which was quite good though .
first time to a conveyor belt sushi place .
i highly recommend you try this place out .
$ 0 drafts all day everyday .
i come here for sporting events all the time .
arizona alumni club is here .
i thought it was a blast .
great sports bar in old town .
lots of tvs and a good draft selection .
obviously like any business they learn as they grow .
great drink selection and killer atmosphere .
<UNK> always does my hair .
it ' s fast and she provides pleasant conversation .
all for a great price .
what can go wrong ?
bad service + cheap food !
you are destined to fail .
was it an interesting experience overall ?
was the food overpriced ?
hands down the best brisket i have ever had .
they do every thing right .
a server with a black eye .
pedestrian ` ` signature ' ' pasta .
front of the house has some work to do .
the problem is the service .
and it comes from the top .
"visited here on friday , january 00th for lunch ."
probably try somewhere else next time .
had the foie gras poutine and the foie burger .
both were extremely good .
the price for the quality is second to none .
this place is not an irish pub .
i left a $ 0 tip .
she ' s got my biz for life !
it was on par with peter piper pizza .
great food and coolest soda fountain machine .
she even brings out your food and cleans up .
great design and atmosphere .
sophisticated yet inviting with a relax feel .
lucky it was only about a bad battery .
they arrived promptly and did n't keep me waiting .
they tacked on $ 000 for mandatory insurance .

the food was excellent .
the prices for this type of food are reasonable .

best flavor combination you could ask for .
let ' s try and be fair here .
followed with the kobe beef tataki .

ended with a toro scallion roll .
steaks are supposed to be flavorful .
i ' ll end on a good note .
ordered the beef tartare .
"however , the <UNK> was bland dry and flat ."
however the service was quite good .
the first time i got chinese food .
got the mongolian beef and the scallop and shrimps .

at least the meat burgers .
the best place for a vege burger period .
try a 0 guys instead .
bartenders made the evening a blast with bar games .
great drinks and good times .
las vegas is dangerous for a foodie .

the garlic knots are also very tasty .
my problem is with the pizza .
the stadium is brand new and nice .
the field is pretty good .
the lines are barely visible .
this is definitely a 0 star place .
a very solid offering for the charlotte art scene .
driving to far east san diego to eat you .
now driving to south end from university city .
the food is reasonably priced and tastes superb .
it is still very good though .
the people are hospitable and the prices reasonable .
"the tostada was fine , but not too special ."
finally our waitress showed after quite some time .
"the food was ok , but not great ."
does this place have hype ?
a pretty new looking park .
good wine selection and fantastic decor .
xs <UNK> las vegas nightlife and is beyond description .
it borders perfection and is simply mind blowing .
lax has become the new standard of vegas nightlife .
the pork was good but nothing extraordinary .
not one call was returned .

not to detract from the gym though .
checking in was simple and quick .
"in my book , this is bad business ."
both times they were great .
you know what the thing is with culvers ?
asparagus have a great lemony zing .
all in all great food and service .

five stars ; you decide .
i guess they do n't speak spanish either .
"and why should they , this is america ."
at least it had character then .
now it ' s just <UNK> and way overpriced .
very gourmet with a great menu and reasonably priced .
the overall atmosphere suited my <UNK> taste .
"i , dick <UNK> <UNK> here twice for dinner ."
both times i enjoyed myself .
of course i ordered some .
been eating here for years .
service and prices can not be beat .
will stop if i have no other options .
but the food is actually very good .
now to the food part .
the pastrami is what docked the experience two stars .
i will return and maybe update the review .
pizza gets a 0 .

stupid and never should have happened .
poor customer service and a lack of hospitality training .
chair at desk in room is steel and uncomfortable .
the <UNK> in the room was extremely loud .
no power switch available .
very pleasantly surprised by this place .
employees do n't do just the minimum here .
good <UNK> = good operations .
ate dinner here after a long drive .
pretty worn decor but no points off for that .
i say good bye as well .
the toppings interacted with the base wonderfully .
the crust was very average however .
chips almost always hot and salted reasonably .
` ` worst service ever .
returns with drinks promptly .
appetizers arrive not so promptly .
maybe they made a great tiramisu .
just came back from here .
where this meal fell short was the entrees .
- rrb - was just ordinary .
and then the lamb .
a quick and disappointing review .
still stand by my prior review .
i was born vietnamese but grew up denying it .
"wow , just wow ."
i wanted to be friends again .
this confidence came to be <UNK> .
"the rice was straightforward , cooked <UNK> ."
and this was a dangerously addicting version .
i guess my lunch was pretty straightforward .
and this is where the magic begins .
everything was top notch ingredients and freshly made .
i especially liked throwing in the bell peppers .
you opened me to a whole new world .
a man ' s expectations are defeated .
"ping pong table outside , and <UNK> !"
quick review time at work !
avoid the stuffed filet preparations however .
"free wi-fi too , nice touch ."
0 well deserved star update !
fiancee responded we needed a few more menus .
ranchero sauce was fine .
beans and rice were acceptable .
"<UNK> salad was fine , but too peppery ."
there were some hopeful <UNK> .
a very thin sauce once again .
as good as it gets !
not the case with <UNK> .
the food is incredible .
thanks high tide for another great experience .
friends of mine and myself had bad experience .

german food is n't cuisine that attracts most foodies .
"more bier , more better ."
"to get in quickly , eat early ."
warning : food is very inconsistent .
the place is historically marvelous .
you can enjoy classic diner decor .
the portions are generous and the price is reasonable .
a single pancake is a meal .
the pig included a selection of 0 sauces .
the apple bbq sauce was top notch .
it ' s sweet with a hot finish .

"waterpark was very nice , maybe a bit pricey ."
my problem is with their shady business practices .
the good : the bed was very comfortable .

i decided to give these guys a try .
not all companies are the same .
her communication skills are sorely lacking .
a low pressure environment and extremely knowledgeable .
it is nice to see a new manager here .

a bit pricey for what you get though .
recommend the appetizer portion .

the food is where it <UNK> stars for me .
bill with tip was 0.00 food : 0/0 .
"ooo , ooo , ooo where to begin ."
this is not the place to eat .
but would say this place delivers quality cheap cuts .
there only <UNK> cause there 00/0 stores .
and the best part is its all chicken .
downright home style cooking .
now thats what i call good training .
. takes 00 min to get 0 dollar beers .
quick friendly service like always and very clean .
cheaper gas and a wide variety of selection .
try the new qt kitchen items .
so here ' s a true story .
. nothing to brag about but ok .
. im talkin hundreds of people .
the employees take there cows seriously .
this will be a 0.0 star review .
what else can ya ask for .
guys are straight forward and honest .
"clean store , badly mannered employees ."
on a crappy dirt filled lot with trash everywhere .
the store is old small and disgusting inside .
. great guy with great food and prices !
. come early cause it gets packed !
but the only argument is the price .
that is just ridiculous .
also no drink fountain .
also there a little over priced in my book .
this however does not make excuses for this starbucks .
the managers obviously need to learn to do inventory .
its a hunters paradise and a <UNK> nightmare lol .
if your asking why the 0 stars then ?
either my favorite pei wei or just about close .
enough said cause it ' s a qt .
lots of pumps and space for that morning traffic .
try the custard as well everything is top notch .
always a stop for desert .
now here is the review on the food .
they have all the familiar chinese food .
. triple teriyaki burger combo <UNK> !
best chinese good in the area .
do n't expect club music and <UNK> .
for her check up and first series of shots .

poor location of pumps .
. pho was 0/0 stars .
to be completely honest i hate this home depot .
you wo n't be dissapointed .
loco moco was not what i was used to .

original commitment to quality is key to success .
authentic comfort food and the price is right .
pretty decent chinese food for the price .
great place and food .
pretty good pizza i enjoyed it .
this place wo n't last !
i would n't go to the place again though .

"sorry vida , you lost me and my money ."
here comes the criticisms .
appetizers were priced and portioned correctly .
the <UNK> was done in 0 <UNK> .
"either bring 0 or 0 , not 0 !"
this is clearly a rip off .
all the wines were priced like this .
the owner needs to invest in better wait staff .
for all the reasons above apparently .
but this was unacceptable even under those conditions .
that alone is unacceptable .
they did comp the entire fiasco .
"take it from me , i know this ."
that ' s the correct wait time .
there are better places .
"well , finally tried this new location ."
the food is mediocre at best .
this place is a joke .
there was no waiter / waitress on duty .
thanks for the biased remark !
"like i said , this place is a joke ."
this store needs remodeling badly .
the store is old and i might say dirty .
stay away if at all possible .
the whole wheat pizza crust was soggy and tasteless .
that is all that ' s need to be said
this is a pretty shitty place .
no beer on tap .
it ' s not your typical mexican place .
"the chips are okay , but not great ."
cheap to upgrade to a larger car .
this is good for a couple reasons kids .
"highly recommend , you wont be disappointed ."
looks like a good barber shop !

i have never had a bad meal here .
not easy to load up everything twice .
it was a great suprise .
specialty rolls are what differentiate sushi places .
$ 000 for three people .
there is no wow factor here .
there is zero creativity in this place .
incredible menu and reasonably priced for the area .

the pulled pork was ok for pulled pork .
"though , to a lesser degree ."

<UNK> may or may not be admitted .
depends on the front desk clerk .
beer selection : great .
it does n't say one from each category .
"lastly , no draft beer ."
you are off point .
"love the pancakes , very filling , good value ."
great to have a breakfast place like this .
i guess even great restaurants have bad days .

overall worth a look .
it sucked and wasted my time .
other then that it was good .
employees are always friendly and restaurant is always clean .
this place is great .
it was a great volume level .

it was more of a well done cooked steak .

the ramen burger was n't very much impressive either .
it was like this was her first time serving .

the sandwich on the other was pretty good .
i rather pay double elsewhere now .

the amount of food for the price is good .
a must try for lunch ... and catering .

you know what is a big deal ?
"cool idea , video games and drinks ."

also the 0th floor rehab wing is amazing .
this place is a japanese ramen noodle bar .

the dealers were really cool .
my biggest complaint was the set times .
the local bands are allowed 00 minute sets .
but that ' s just my two cents .
damn good donuts and awesome staff !
i ca n't imagine anyone likes this .
just make the show times more consistent and reasonable .
house of blues is a really great <UNK> venue .
she played for about an hour and fifteen minutes .
i have nothing bad to say about this place .
the tab was around 00 bucks .
service was ok for a small restaurant .
my experience at the albertsons was pretty awesome tonight .
i guess they are trying to save money .
give it a try .
you wo n't be disappointed .
at the end it was only 00.00 dollars .
it was maybe 00 minutes away from the search .
it ' s 0 bucks .
donut <UNK> actually fits right in on charleston .
the order did not arrive until 000 pm .

next up ... breakfast for dinner .
the potatoes were the bomb .
the bacon was burned ... badly .
the over easy eggs were just ok .
the ham was great .
the substituted as desert .
the first time when it opened back in 0000 .
a side of vegetables came with the plate .
it ' s always 0 teller working .
fresh seafood is not a bad way to go .
the pork butt was outstanding .
two words ... the bomb .
desert was strawberry shortcake and bread pudding .
be prepared to witness a small casino area .
the restaurant stays busy .
he tells me i was lucky .
the guy that got on the phone was argumentative .
i can honestly see babystacks cafe <UNK> this building .
please go to a more reputable place .
drive thru is painfully slow still .
good for a family breakfast .
to me the food was bland .
the salad bar was ok .
so i ordered the 00 ounce steak medium rare .
i finished it and got the <UNK> for fee .
i find this place <UNK> i fix .
i just told him to keep the 0 bucks .
he saved me 00 dollars .
me and my girlfriend went .
i prefer lowes over home depot anyday .
last stop to fill up for awhile .
now here ' s the dilemma .
the games are pretty pricey .
even the used games .
one tire alone new is 000 dollars new .
honestly it looks a little deserted from the outside .
there are a few of benches around the park .
just be prepared to spend over a hundred dollars .
it has an old school feel to it .
the guys split their separate ways .
sadly the photo i snapped is all they had .
it would be pretty hard to mess this up .
take note that the place closes at 0pm .
their texas bread is awesome as well .
i got an awesome coach belt for christmas .
overall the pizza was good though .
other than that i like the place .
he really did n't have a reply for that .
i declined to sign the receipt .
one of my favorite gas station to stop at .
this one was one of the better ones .
mainly through the drive through late at night .
atleast you know what your getting into .
hail to the current hole in the walls .
"fast , efficient , and great doctor ."
what keeps me coming back ... my mortgage payment !
i went in for a replacement .
he states $ 00.00 for a single din receiver .
this is at 00:00 am .
that ' ll be all .
it has that old school diner feel to it .
the potatoes are kick ass .
as i write this im wishing i had more .
it <UNK> in the oven .
the usual bar atmosphere .
the owner is down to earth and definitely friendly .
the reuben was definitely the bomb as well .
fresh corn beef not that store bought imitation stuff .
and so does mike .
i buy all my pool supplies from here .
best bargain on food on the strip .
pastrami ruben was <UNK> .
<UNK> bison tongue : this is tongue well done .
i enjoyed this dish very much .
overall a good dish .
the grounds have dumpsters prominently displayed .
el paso burger : pretty good .
"however , it ' s a substitute ."
club saloon sandwich : i really liked this sandwich .
this place is a maze .
overall a pleasant stay .
the space itself is quite good .
it ' s not that the bagel was bad .
they actually had multiple types .
great service and free wifi .
people are not loud on the buses .
one thing does remain the same though .
it ' s about $ 00 to go up .
it ' s a complete copy of chipotle .
"i tried the barbacoa bowl , which was decent ."
this is a great environment once you get in .
the buffet itself is pretty good .
they have some great items and a few misses .
worth a quick trip on the yellow metro line .
i was amazed by the extent of this place .
when heated this thing is amazing .
large windows let in ample light .
the hot chocolate here is awesome .
the matcha latte is very good but very milky .
some of the underwater displays were also quite cool .
dumplings were delicious as were the curries .
their spiciness scale is off .
just had the best sesame bagel of my life .
it ' s pretty simple .
both played great music .
the third floor is a large techno remix floor .
the flat white was excellent .
the parfait and caprese sandwich were also great .
this is no ordinary subway stop .
"fresh sea food , king crab leg , oyster ."
best haircut i have gotten it a while .
just got done eating an amazing meal .
thank you guys for everything you did for us .
nobody could be found picking them up .
place you cant move .
you cant enjoy yourself .
i rather <UNK> xs or omnia .
this place has the best sandwiches .
this is amazing little sandwich shop .
they do it right .
"the place is closed , and out of business ."
and i like mine on their smoke meat poutine .
do n't listen to the <UNK> .
this review is specifically for the sushi bar .
these guys are straight up honest !
do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else !
new menu is weak sauce .
i would n't take rude behavior personal .
0000 reviews and 0â 0/0 stars ?
i had to try this place .
empanadas : a hit as well .
"regardless of your tastes , they carried it ."
it was a pico with a medium spice .
"the rooms are clean , but again , no-frills ."
"wtf - you work there , right ?"
i kinda felt ripped off .
at least i would have been drunk and satisfied .
i ca n't say anything bad about the dish .
at least i tried it .
their biscuits and gravy are pretty awesome as well .
no complaints as every morsel was absolutely fantastic .
most places offer that anyways .
"first , the air is not stale and smokey ."
generally this leads to horrible service .
but the crew at gallo blanco was stellar .
service was also quite splendid .
moderately strong <UNK> at a price you can afford .
capriottis is way better than subway and jimmy johns .
the <UNK> is the best sub on their menu .
"every time i order , it comes out perfect ."
cool people and great sandwiches .
<UNK> is hands-down the best sub ever made .
good food but way too expensive .
very good food here .
i was looking for someplace new to try .
my wife and i stepped in here by chance .
the pizzas were much better than i expected .
its in a dilapidated strip mall .
in town for the night and pulled out yelp .
the wait staff was great .
- rrb - and a little more oil .
"tasted like baskin robbins , no big deal ."
the hotel and hotel staff are great .
one or two buddies and you ' re good .
i miss my old bartender .
monday nights are awful at this place .
the pizza is always good the beer is cheap .
it is close and 0 .
it is da bomb .
"now , on to this specific roberto ' s ."
i got the cheese enchilada meal .
santa fe check yo stuff !
"love the place , been there many times ."
the staff has always been friendly and always responsive .
you wo n't be disappointed !
i was blown away .
this place was a riot !
"great find and a must try , thanks gang jb"
this is a place that specializes in <UNK> pizza .
got ta love that kind of pride !
pictures of classic motown musicians all over the walls .
very good quality breakfast food items .
pretty nice looking restaurant period .
cons : weird entrance .
very good cafe type of place .
i remember this place .
q : what are the prices like ?
a : $ 0 for a dozen .
"better deal , for a better tasting donut ."
q : what else should i know ?
a : they have a wide selection of donuts .
this place is sick .
now this was sick .
leftovers that are basically guaranteed ?
i ' ll be back alright .
<UNK> village is a rather weird place .
friendlier crowd and staff .
free shuttle to the strip .
lots of things to do on the property .
the place is laid out like a labyrinth .
oh god the <UNK> scent of the venetian .
cons : not so extensive cd and dvd selection .
- lrb - with the exception of <UNK> .
talk about a surprise ripoff - rrb - .
so i finally did check the place out .
what a wise decision .
"no <UNK> , increased blood pressure feeling afterward ."
the dining floor is very nice though .
my bill came out to be about $ 00 .
the final verdict : pros : fresh food .
cons : iffy service .
too many glass noodles in everything .
suggestions : be more conservative with the glass noodles .
all of which makes the place even more awesome .
"wow , how things change as you get older ."
the fake trees and plants inside are quite hilarious .
amsterdam always seemed more appealing than paris .
pros : the best burgers i have ever eaten .
fries are pretty much perfect .
cheaper than carl ' s jr . .
better than fatburger in pretty much every way .
cons : should be 00 hours .
they ' ve only taken stuff from me once .
turns out this was a bad idea .
the service : so-so .
it was used for cold cuts and bread .
this is a buffet that has cold cuts .
the final verdict : pros : cheap .
"it reminded me of the orleans , but worse ."
old and in some serious need of work ?
"it was a rather dark , <UNK> atmosphere ."
pros : cheap cheap cheap .
much closer to authentic than taco bell .
i ' ll review the actual coffee later .
facilities : decent enough .
it ' s too focused on absurd stuff .
there ' s purple all over the place .
i always seem to win here .
just come here and see it all for yourself .
wise choice on my behalf .
pretty damn good hot dogs .
one hot dog can fill you up pretty well .
down to earth ambiance .
"oh god , this place ."
cons : there never seems to be anything new .
not very exciting at all anymore .
desperately in need of a remodel .
"please , you guys need to do something ."
do n't know what happened .
- rrb - and an occasional t-shirt .
and then you have ... walmart people .
just go to <UNK> to see some examples .
and this <UNK> my first review of 0000 .
this t . i . thing is bullshit .
what kid did n't have a pirate phase ?
what happened to it ?
what the hell is this ?
"where have you been all my life , ichiza ?"
"sushi , ramen , and anything else japanese ?"
in one little space ?
cons : way too many calories .
cons : the decor is kind of a <UNK> .
the racial violence and tension !
the highly religious nature of america at the time !
"oh , and the atrocious fashion !"
old fashioned bubble gum ?
vintage posters and advertisements ?
they ' re just there to enhance the experience .
the final verdict pros : old-fashioned candy store .
used to be better .
commercial center is different though .
way to fail at <UNK> .
"turns out , it was n't that bad ."
no wonder no one likes riding the greyhound bus .
... i think this place is closed now .
mmmmmm ... jamaican meat pies .
sells a wide variety of items .
vintage vegas photos and posters adorn the walls .
"absolutely , shame the place is closing ."
this place is huge .
cardio : wide variety .
the italian cheese bread is kind of amazing .
* 00th review * stayed here back in 0000 .
room : average but decently sized and comfortable .
"a very , very good thing ."
introduced me to that wondrous thing called the gyro .
cons : a tad steep .
pros : one of the best buffets in vegas .
not as tacky as it once was .
service can be iffy .
was a lot better when i was a kid .
"oh my god , major props to you ."
well there you go .
you know what else is laughable ?
and then you had jillian ' s .
i wish this place could stay a secret forever .
the cheese was bubbly and piping hot .
not bad at all for the strip .
peach sprite in particular is very good .
as for the ambiance of the place ?
i ca n't say i cared for it .
the ` ` <UNK> ' ' type menu .
the out of the ordinary soda fountain .
cons : very noisy .
and then of course the competitive gamblers ?
the women so fine it ' s unreal ?
"i have a really <UNK> imagination , i know ."
chinatown is getting quite epic .
cons : still too touristy .
tries way too damn hard to be hip .
this was one of them .
it ' s a pretty interesting building architecture wise .
slightly better than average .
pretty good meat pies / patties .
another thing i remember is the race for <UNK> .
is it mind blowing pizza ?
option for <UNK> up .
the bad : can get really crowded .
the show is actually very well done .
cons : overpriced at face .
cons : too many calories .
they have hot sauce now .
not all of them have cars - rrb - .
"well , they serve up gumbo ."
cons : ridiculously <UNK> .
egg rolls contain no meat whatsoever .
cons : service can be rude overpriced at face .
pros : very good coffee .
cons : overpriced cigarettes .
why are they selling cigarettes to begin with ?
it ' s still open 00 hours .
treasure island used to be awesome .
is n't it general consensus that it sucks ?
it may not even be that bad .
"i grab two donuts , and they tasted amazing ."
i had the # 0 .
pros : the burgers are huge .
fries are n't half bad .
i kind of dig the vibe of the place .
very good customer service .
cons : the name <UNK> is inaccurate .
it should be renamed <UNK> .
the mall itself is a very interesting environment .
more accessible than the forum shops .
not much more to say .
my favorite hawaiian restaurant in all of vegas .
it ' s pretty damn nice in here now .
i ' m a weirdo .
the best of all the pizza chains .
the seats themselves sucked on the other hand .
and that ' s about it .
"upscale , but generally inclusive ."
the interior is a sight to behold .
okay so on to the point of this review .
hey there goes louis vuitton !
cons : long waits inbetween buses / infrequent service .
gives priority to the strip / tourists .
i hate las vegas public transportation .
that ' s besides my point - rrb - .
just needed to let that out .
and that ' s just one issue .
<UNK> - enough with these blasted <UNK> already .
"and yes , this is n't the only example ."
cons : tickets for shows are always really expensive .
the food was ok at best .
similar experience that is found at a chain restaurant .
a definite must not visit while in las vegas .
this is the 0rd time i have stayed here .
this has been my go-to spot for years .
i ' ll still give them another shot .
the food was down right horrid .
your taste buds will thank you !
a heaven for beer geeks !
this place definitely lives up to the hype .
. nightclub upstairs opens at eight .
ample portions for an upscale restaurant .
great brews and brewers .
good local brewery vibe .
this woman deserves a merit .
and the mayo n scottsdale location is no exception .
the best thai food in town .
"fresh , quality ingredients ."
from the moment you walk in you feel welcomed .
all vegetarian and and the most wonderfully flavorful dishes .
please wash the carafes .
if you have time try cartel instead .
old men drinking cans of pbr and <UNK> ice .
looking for a cheap dive in homestead ?
i am going to keep this simple .
the place was so slow .
the valet guy was our waiter and bus boy .
$ 000 and we both left and ate pizza .
portion was ample but nothing special .
my review is only based on the appetizers .
and drinks during happy hour .
the interior was hip and modern .
i moved to wisconsin two years ago .
thanks gary and <UNK> !
significant number of vegetarian items on the menu .
nothing has changed and i hope it never does .
barry i like the one at the <UNK> better .
we found it by accident .
the texture and flavor were superb .
"dining room is functional , but far from comfortable ."
there are no frills here .
"no more , no less ."
at that time we were treated as valuable customers .
one of the best places to eat out at .
i must say i was pretty impressed .
save the tuna appetizer was on point and superb .
. definitely a must stop when in pittsburgh area .
the staff was friendly and extremely helpful .
the grounds and site is well kept and relaxing .
the atmosphere and wait staff were both very pleasant .
"good service , relaxed atmosphere and decent food ."
security came and took a report but nothing happened .
$ 000 for a meal that was only so-so .
take your hard earned money and spend it elsewhere .
their service is top notch .
i ' m a huge fan of this place .
"first off , i love the <UNK> stout ."
and the <UNK> pale ale is excellent too .
another favorite of mine is the southwestern chicken sandwich .
you ca n't go wrong here .
always a good sign .
this place is huge .
"i had the crane <UNK> , it was amazing ."
no complaints from the 0 drinkers .
i of course tried all three .
"food , service and atmosphere all a + ."
we had a very good time at the mint .
the food was very good .
the hot dogs are the <UNK> .
the lengua tacos are amazing .
mikes way is the way to go .
i stopped taking my cars here .
this is a great lunch combo .
cool little lunch spot .
breakfast burritos are some of the best in town .
green chile and red chile burritos .
great fast and friendly service .
you wo n't regret it .
"above all things , customer service was top notch ."
went on a sunday evening .
well worth the cost .
"good desserts and nice cool , calm atmosphere !"
this is not the place .
the fried zucchini was great .
the rooms are standard for a hotel .
to top things off the service was slow .
there are tv screens all throughout this place .
lines are long but move along quickly .
this is n't your boxed mac-n-cheese .
perhaps that ' s a good thing for me ?
i would look for something a little more secluded .
damn if i could only post the video .
bring an appetite ... leave broke .
massive does not begin to describe city center .
"here , that is not an issue ."
one of the draws to <UNK> is their service .
parking here is a breeze .
my only knock on panevino is their pricing .
the park itself appears to be well maintained .
now i understand the <UNK> of the situation .
with regards to their brisket or pulled pork ?
* <UNK> in excess of $ 000 dollars .
* more footwear stores than i ever knew existed .
serendipity also features a $ 0000 golden opulence sundae .
everything in this place speaks money .
filet mignon - the king of all beefs .
pork loin - seasoned well and very tender .
holy cow this place is awesome !
i did n't expect that from a movie theater .
very good mediterranean fare .
very flavorful and authentic .
the curry is outstanding as is the fried rice .
i recommend you try it .
the atmosphere is good and the beer cold .
a decent burger and lots of fried fare .
try the appetizer sampler it wo n't disappoint .
my recommendation for the best thai in charlotte .
best german food in town .
great place to go in southpark .
best restaurant at the mall .
also the buffalo burger is an interesting choice .
great old school vibe with class .
the salmon and heirloom salad were both great .
naan is a must too .
grab a cocktail here if you ' re near .
but it was all down hill from there .
"yes , cold people ."
on the strip and off .
made the mistake of coming here on black friday .
this place is great .
ok so now the review of the food .
the lines were also not that bad .
the servers here take their sweet ass time .
best buffet in charlotte .
the soup was greats best buffet in charlotte .
anything but take responsibility themselves .
very professional and friendly .
will not be returning unless they renovate the imax .
edit : way too many loud high school kids .
saw several girls dressed in next to nothing .
bikini bottoms and duct tape outfits asking for tips .
"no conditions , no exceptions , no question ."
i just received a reply from the wynn today .
it ' s all good at the mgm .
- clean restaurant on the strip in las vegas .
is a small place with a good food .
i was there on a sunday around 0pm .
bartender was super nice and very helpful .
not extraordinary but very good .
good place for a date or a meeting .
what more could you ask for ?
if you are downtown make sure you stop in .
very clear on the phone for the accent <UNK> .
the <UNK> did not really complement the chilies .
would not order this again .
the staff were not very bright .
i recommend you try this .
it exceeded my very high exceptions .
this is a completely different level .
they were denny ' s quality servers .
a clear effort to turn over tables quickly .
similarly priced places would never do this .
not screwing around with the spice .
the pork was phenomenal .
good soul food style .
not your typical chain restaurant .
great fresh pizza made well .
very friendly and professional staff .
she ' s not very good at cutting hair .
this place makes a bad diner look good .
i had the steak and shrimp which was adequate .
"first , i am staying at mandalay bay ."
in the room there is a booklet of offers .
i inquired about the golf analysis and wide shoes .
"it had its own identity , with good food ."
my wife had a bagel that was hard .
it was just as good as expected .
i thought they were both excellent .
this place is great .
a big difference from the old town scene .
fantastic burger joint across from the wynn .
accommodated our group of 0 no problem .
must stop when in tempe .
the first course was a shrimp appetizer dish .
second course was the lobster cassoulet .
"delicious , savory , and elegant dish ."
this was the case at emeril ' s .
excellent dish yet again .
a word about the ambiance - not much there .
service - excellent wait staff .
i hope others give emeril ' s a try .
no way around it : this place is overpriced .
food itself it good not great .
price was about 00 % too high .
entirely doable for lunch .
dead lunch crowd on a weekday .
nice place but poorly managed .
bar tenders are nice though and make great cocktails .
better off eating at mcdonalds .
"best managed subway , anywhere ."
the staff are very friendly and very fast .
go to bertha ' s .
0 - rrb - decent prices on equipment .
okay prices on bikes .
0 - rrb - good selection of equipment !
<UNK> is my lbs home from now on .
problem 0 : very dry chicken .
problem 0 : the candidate finally quits talking .
' ' no one laughs .
i go to look around and compare bikes .
i ' ll call before i come back .
are there any options for switching that out .
everybody likes that <UNK> .
are there any other options ?
"' ' i say , ` ` seriously ?"
most cost around $ 00-00 .
it would have saved us this conversation .
this is probably not good for me .
i built my own burger .
still it had an excellent taste .
best pizza shop in bloomfield .
wife used the spa and found it excellent .
great show at the paris hotel in las vegas .
the seating was great .
many folks go twice because there are two <UNK> .
you got ta try their watermelon wheat ale .
the spicy tuna roll is fantastic .
best pizza in the entire west valley !
had a breakfast burrito .
"not the best , but not the worst ."
slightly pricey but pretty tasty .
no special sauces though .
i would advise against the spicy korean .
might try it out again .
what a great place .
made correct ! ! ! great place .
"do n't forget the lions habitat , a must ."
deliver took longer that estimated time .
that was n't the bad part .
the best junk food and fast service .
and here is the kicker .
best juices in town !
the best locally made juices in town .
new vaping place in vegas .
its a cool place to hang out .
"support a local vendor , and pay online prices ."
he runs weekly / monthly specials that are excellent .
i actually tied the slots on the way out .
not worth the trouble .
jet luxury is not at all ` ` luxurious .
"' ' second , read that fine print ."
the show outside is a little disappointing .
"being vegas , the inside labyrinth is intentionally confusing ."
do n't forget to present your points card .
three words : vdara death ray .
"plenty of space , clean , nicely appointed ."
the off season price is outstanding .
this is another great restaurant at aria .
it was perfectly cooked medium rare .
service and food here are of the highest quality .
early evening menu was of great value .
i was one of three customers there .
delicious and creative appetizers and salads .
should have sub it with fruits .
this breakfast place is exactly what this area needs .
other stuff on the menu looks too heavy .
if i could i would give it negative stars .
they said no problem bring them by .
i stopped in to this shop at 0:00 pm .
this guy really new his stuff .
the food was great and very cheap .
they also have a wide selection of beers .
"that ' s a win for us , right ?"
bus was 00 minutes late at pickup .
tom arrives at 0pm .
do not expect much here .
the best italian restaurant in the venetian .
clams with linguine excellent .
<UNK> sauce was as good as it gets .
a nice introduction to hawaiian infused foods .
fries and chili cheese fries are amazing as well .
any of their <UNK> are amazing .
i will make this a regular spot for me .
been here 0 times and everything is always perfect .
"no water , nothing ."
huge fail and not sure i will come back .
this is a tough review to make .
this food is magnificent .
the mole <UNK> is particularly spectacular .
service is very friendly .
i went to chandler to buy my epic .
"a new , quaint little stop in oakland ."
i suggest you check this place out .
"frequent customers , and love the place ."
never had a bad meal or bad experience .
"good bowl of soup to start , lobster <UNK> ."
"david <UNK> , a rio verde ."
chase and ted were excellent .
great service and extremely courteous .
keep up the good work .
nice <UNK> position and nice service .
top down leadership in action .
great customer service from the start .
mainly i was not impressed by their pen collection .
why not put them in a dryer ?
burger toppings are high quality and <UNK> .
"that being said , their sides are awful ."
the food here is awful .
order at your own discretion .
the service was also excellent .
unlike most breweries the food here is delicious !
very memorable cant remember his name though .
quite possible the top thing to do .
im <UNK> and not in a good way .
and make it worth watching .
shrimp had great seasoning and flavor .
"not bad , reasonable ."
event the skin was grossly soggy and inedible .
my impression was that is was microwaved .
"good quality , little quantity ."
great coffee and beer .
probably the coolest coffee house in scottsdale .
"top-notch , in all respects ."
"great help and professionals , first rate facility ."
an <UNK> that has outstanding work and customer service .
"moreover , there was no cleanup !"
"most of all , they were very effective ."
the drying station was remarkably easy to use .
what a great business model .
"great treats , decent price ."
tvs are on and people are chatting .
a very happening place .
ross did an excellent job .
the quality of the food is superb .
"ambience , service and pricing as it should be ."
will be back to this place again .
nice place to hangout with friends .
been here a few times .
like the fact that menu is new york inspired !
man this place is great !
nothing like my last trip to vegas .
special shout out to him .
for the cost i expected a little more .
my girlfriend had the pizza .
"it was good , but nothing special ."
ca n't understand why this place gets high ranking .
excellent prices for the quality as well as quantity .
great ` ` local ' ' spot .
also grabbed some rice pudding .
it is the strip and its ruth chris .
"good food , prices , <UNK> , atmosphere ."
the restaurant decor is very simple .
these guys are my go to <UNK> !
best christian school in phx !
favorite place to see a <UNK> !
get the best yogurt next door after at zoyo !
simply the best around !
"solid , solid food !"
i had the ham & cheese omelette .
how could dimsum in vegas be any good ?
or ever comparable to la dimsum .
i can not recommend this place enough .
this happened at 0:00 pm on a friday .
if you call the front desk .
the standard of food was generally good .
unfortunate end to a pleasant evening .
this place is not a-ok .
the food is generic and overpriced .
what else can you say ?
this location had a great wait staff .
tuesdays are generally the slowest days for fast food .
food is pretty good .
a lot or bacon .
menu has expanded greatly though over the years .
deserts and shakes more .
tortilla lightly cooked for that texture you need .
the carne was well seasoned and marinated .
nice and blackened for that crunch .
they use lard which does make a difference .
that is an important quality in any mexican kitchen .
very flavorful and the nugget pizza is a keeper .
the house lager is not anything special .
order a bud light for the same experience .
the lower rating is for service .
only real negative experience though .
it is pretty good .
i think the nachos selection is great .
this is place is horrible !
the biggest issue here is .
i ' ll take my business elsewhere .
"fast work , fair prices and great communication ."
"good lord , this is some fantastic food ."
the flamingo is not one of them .
then i noticed that the sausage was terrific .
had some really intriguing pizzas on the menu .
i go to restaurants for the food .
. first and foremost .
"all around great food , keep it up !"
"awesome show , great vip service ."
would do this every time i am in vegas .
yet the real star was the food .
i will definitely revisit on future trips .
first the good : this is a nice facility .
i order from here often .
this place is awesome !
the sliders were awesome as well .
raising canes is legit !
none of the games work properly .
ill pass on this place .
allow substitutions on omelets .
"yes , we had two dinners ."
"food , however , was great ."
"rich as shit though , so be careful ."
this way also very good .
"so , worth going ."
scenes shifts without something to link them .
the only person clapping was the bartender .
"please , do n't waste your money ."
service was decent but nothing out of the ordinary .
just another addition to the greatest super bowl vacation !
this place gets the boston approval for sure !
i stayed in this hotel for a business meeting .
the hotel is connected to aria by a walkway .
short by vegas standards .
the sports book is the best example .
what else could you ask for ?
nice place with a fun ambiance .
the tacos are good .
the best meat was the carnitas .
definitely do the carnitas on whatever you get .
the asada had a nice grill flavor .
the pastor was good .
a good different take on a burger .
"great location , great food , great service ."
everyone has a bad day once in a while .
great choice as the food and service was great .
do n't give this establishment your service or money .
. not too pricey .
had a good time i like this place .
. small and good pizza .
it ' s a kool spot i guess .
. step it up please 0st time eating there .
good bartenders but food is ok now .
and wash it down with a blue moon .
. what do you expect ?
"food is not bad , but was expensive ."
had exceptional baking skills .
i eventually stumbled upon <UNK> on yelp .
they always only recommend the work that is necessary .
the best and that is what <UNK> is .
"smashburger has now arrived in charlotte , nc ."
some people did n't like them .
the part that really stood out was the bacon .
what words come to mind when describing 0church ?
". or in <UNK> terms , white cheese ."
i ' ll get to that later .
. and have eaten at plenty of steak houses .
. or whatever you want to call it .
after a few minutes of the hot .
the teriyaki chicken wings were delicious .
. but krazy fish definitely deserves the honor .
this is where the night got a little better .
the accompaniment were good but overall pretty forgettable .
thats right ... you open another one .
my recommendation ... go to kickstand .
bring her back please .
that is all you need to know .
everything else is <UNK> / generic .
they alternate who goes up and down the ramp .
they literally do n't clean this place .
make no mistake : literally .
veal chop was stellar .
interiors are a dressed up yard house vibe .
mahi mahi and the chicken were fantastic .
she is a pro with years of experience .
"cool place , great beers ."
i had the lamb chops and veggies .
looking forward to many more good times .
but these issues were with the grand canal shoppes .
welcome to the hood .
all were very good .
i will come back soon for dinner .
the food is consistent and great .
keep up the great work .
really enjoy this place .
the variety of food they offer is great .
the korean short ribs are out of this world .
this place completely blew my mind .
"great price , great people , great service ."
yes the lady also licked her fingers .
what next in this shameless <UNK> of the public .
their thrifty brand ice was delicious .
i found the sls to be perfect .
my room in the world tower was excellent .
"the antipasti salad , wings and pizza are fantastic !"
pretty much any type you want .
the butcher and deli counter are quick and knowledgeable .
i recommend this place .
ajo ramen and miso ramen were good .
this place does hoagies right .
the pizza here is different from your traditional place .
the meal was very reasonably price considering the quality .
pretty decent comfort food to me .
the dirty rice was actually better at this place .
give it a try .
overpriced for what you get .
good drink and food selection .
needless to say i will never visit <UNK> again .
the tortas were disappointing again .
not impressed and not returning again .
this company is incredibly lame .
we can get more value at firehouse .
i ' m done with chipotle .
incredible quality with great service .
dollar does n't think its worth much .
what ' s the deal with this place ?
stopped here pretty late on a thursday night .
overall i enjoyed most of the selection .
so i was pleased to see it reopen .
a group of 0 visited on a friday might .
i had the peppercorn steak .
i ordered it rare and it came out perfectly .
the house wine was acceptable .
lots of workers but few were helping us customers .
i tried the minced chicken <UNK> .
really well made and fills you up pretty well .
this is one of my favorite spots in phoenix .
i ca n't give them less than one star .
do n't ever use this company under any circumstances .
all transactions were made ... no insurance cards sent .
his secretary steve answers .
steve says they will send one out .
"then , i ask for insurance again ."
what they are doing can not be legal .
this place is a dream come true .
none of my party has contracted <UNK> .
very good hot dogs .
"they also have brats , italian sausage and veggie ."
food is great and the service is even better .

showed up exactly when he said he would .
my car looks spectacular too .
i ca n't recommend scott and crew enough .
pizza is very good .
pizza everything has been excellent .
great place for breakfast .
very filling and decent prices .
"very long wait , but the food is great ."
very good turkey burger and chili dog .
pizza hut has gone down hill fast .
consecutive poor quality pizzas .
this time we find ourselves in phoenix az . .
the concept is great the ice cream is incredible .
thanks melt for the great experience .
it is naples pizza done right .
the pizza and antipasti are all excellent .
"its solid thai , solid ."
the curries and the panang are great .
i has a public library vibe .
just not a fit for a business lunch .
this is a solid fusion street taco joint .
but it is more of an experience place .
all the curries are great .
"its solid and never disappoints , just not amazing ."
brad and joe are two great attorneys .
that stuff was amazing .
"great with family also , just solid kabob fare ."
and best price for there service no <UNK> .
i agree with some previous comments about being understaffed .
not the first time but the 0rd .
as far as timely repairs ... .

waitress was a sad sack of sh * * .
first time visiting hanny ' s friday dec 00 .
the venue : interesting place .
. the decor was minimal and contemporary .
. and the bathrooms were oddly placed upstairs .
this place has a lot of potential .
it just did n't feel alive like az00 does .
the service : good friendly service .
they even put krazy glue on it .
waited a week for them to tell me this .
"excellent service , very clean , great food ."
homeless people out front .
creamed spinach was not very good .
after several bites i pushed the plate away .
"eggs were good , coffee excellent , pancakes sucked ."

the hostess with the <UNK> .
this place has a few areas to sit .
the food has been great .
the restaurant is divided into two dining areas .
this is a german beer hall .
they only have german style beer here .
"in fact , the whole establishment looks fresh ."
a large popcorn and drink runs $ 0 .
"for a chain , they have surprisingly fresh food ."
most home improvement <UNK> are understaffed and crowded places .
not this home depot .
that ' s why this place is a keeper .
the cashier had plenty of pep as well .
"granted , the place is a bit dingy ."
they have an exceptional history and social science section .
i ordered the sesame chicken lunch special .
"no hidden treasures here , just decent mexican food ."
the service suffers at those times .
no entree is more than $ 0 .
the buffet is small and bland .
i ca n't understand how this place remains open .

jonesing for a jolt of caffeine in plaza midwood ?
central coffee will do quite nicely .
"better yet , stop and get something ."
service was prompt despite a near packed house .

the cafe in borders is far better .
- rsb - another starbucks review ?
it ' s all here .
they even have 0 aisles of frozen asian goodies .
"good peeps , though ."
the menu is worth checking out as well .
i usually get this sub with onion rings .
i ' m guessing the exotic flavor rotates ?
you ' ll fit right in .
the lack of seats makes long concerts rather uncomfortable .
the service alone brings the rating down to 0 .
not an art aficionado ?
a true urban oasis .
"perfect for the american palate , i guess ."
the buffet food could have been a little hotter .
"spacious , varied in selection , and low prices ."
"the collection is small , but easily accessible ."
"best buy maybe , mediocre service definitely ."
the men ' s clothes are decent .
the overall experience is great .
"overall , smelly cat makes noda what it is ."
not so with the milestone .
