three of us decided to order this item .
but not the <UNK> ones .
"also , the lox and bagel is good too ."
the bacon brioche was absolutely delicious !
their coffee is incredibly sub-par .
i think their boxed lunch is the worst !
0 stars is not even enough for this office .
and the wine was warm .
the name is <UNK> sweet & zesty chicken salad .
i think that <UNK> is his name .
my second favorite yogurt place !

it came out medium rare anyway .
our time there 0 and half hours .
"i like the salads , and wraps ."

this place is a new favorite for date night .
"sides spicy zucchini , smoked mushrooms and bone marrow ."
there are a handful of basic breakfast selections .

the perfect amount of greasiness and spiciness .
i love it and i miss it !
i check their clearance sections <UNK> .

the servers are always very pleasant and accomodating .
the people that work there are nice .
i decided to skip the use of the facilities .
i would highly recommend him !
"it worked , naturally ."
these are the best cupcakes ever !
every bite was very flavorful .
the seasoning made them taste weird .
the rice was just ok .
i love the ambiance and feel of the place .

so glad a friend recommended them !
i ca n't wait till next time !
i can do a better job myself .
old jukebox with mid-century records ?
everyone who worked there made you feel so vip .
none of us will ever stay here again !
the owner is hilarious and friendly .
it was cooked perfectly - - juicy and delicious !
i would recommend them to anyone !
i placed my order and got what i wanted .
"not pretentious , just right for us ."
"lv , support small businesses !"
this venue is trashy and overpriced .

has to be homemade .
want my 00.00 dollars back !
nice selection of breakfast and bakery items .
we went here last weekend after working out .
classy place without the <UNK> !
my <UNK> cider was tasting crisp and <UNK> .

i prefer a more even creme to pastry ratio .
next course i had the alaska salmon .
take one in the back of the stack .
go try it now ! ! - rsb -
i also think they do fries perfectly .
i would never go to <UNK> .
i became absolutely enchanted with arizona on this hike .
or so we thought .
i can walk to it .
my fave is the tocino .
i ' m recommending it to all my friends .
that alone gives it five stars in my book .
why was i given so much grief ?
first and last time coming here .
"staff is always friendly , coconut shrimp is awesome ."
take it into the bar perhaps .
my veggie friends said best veggie burgers ever .
"no issues here , from beginning to end ."
and all the sides .
kudos for accommodating the vegetarian in our group .
she did not like the french dip at all .
they did n't lie .
the <UNK> is all about the hangover .
"decent price , but not a decent margarita ."
i waited maybe 0 minutes .
the meat was gray and tasteless .
keep up the good work !
but i digress ... .
the tuna tartare was absolutely flavorless .

total waste of $ 00 !
"in short , the food was crap ."
all i can say is omg !
the collard greens were good !
she admitted she heard sauvignon and brought the cabernet .
we went to go see wild last night .
their <UNK> vege was fabulous too .
i just do n't recommend that dish .
"first off , i love the cromwell ."
came through for ayce lunch on a friday .
will definitely do their takeout again !
. this is one of my favorite vape shops .
it was $ 0.00 .
my family and i seriously like this place .
expect to have a younger crowd .
"i do n't understand why , though ."
this place completely pleasantly surprised us !
we asked for a manager and nick disappeared .
i know there ' s another one in seattle .
doctors and nurse <UNK> are always great .
"personally , my favorite is still o . ."
it was definitely pretty amazing .
and their chocolate for mochas are vegan !
my <UNK> friend neil thinks <UNK> is a <UNK> .

bathtub was spacious and toilet flushed with no problem .
"two dozen , shot glass sized cupcakes ."
the food was so delicious too !

"quality , service , decor all trendy and awesome ."
i ' ve ordered from here several times .

and we ' re very anti talking .
everyone is so helpful .
my go to instead of starbucks for sure .
will definitely be going there again !
i spoke of my concerns directly with dr michelle .
everyone was pleased as punch .
everything was very fresh and perfectly cooked .
the daylight savings in other states affected the schedule .
maybe i did n't order the right things .
not too inspiring on that one .
it ' s a very hip and fun environment !
i really loved it .
"we will be back ... many , many times ."
"do not skip the salad , it is delicious ."
especially at holiday time .
i am a fan !
the menu is a newspaper !
<UNK> i will try that .
"runs like water , really smoothly ."
people frequently come in and order for takeout .

i also became addicted to their bbq chicken sandwich .
our fries were perfectly salted and hot .
thank goodness for helpful people .
today we had western omelets .
this food is so good .
scallops were smaller size this time around .
the food was delicious .
the steak tacos are a joke .

this place was filthy and incredibly outdated .
- rrb - and the tempura .
"ok , so : the decor is contemporary ."
maybe the light rail will help !
the <UNK> was <UNK> .
"first off , the place is really charming ."
everyone at milano ' s was extremely helpful !
gave me great directions and made it right in !
i really want a crepe now .
. and oh man it is so good .
. this thing was ginormous !
make sure to ask for extra toast .
tasted like your typical concession stand nacho cheese .
- rrb - and not that tasty .
the lobster in my potatoes had a rubbery texture .
i did not dare bathe in the grimy shower .
i ate my meal there solo .
will definitely be back .
also great that they have complementary valet .
so i live here ... .
i ca n't stop going here now !
that is definitely not the case here .
should be something for everyone .
is n't it enough that they <UNK> smoking inside ?
i do n't think i will come back here .
it had such a fun retro vibe !
i would definitely go back !
wo n't be returning .
"the flavor was great , i absolutely loved it ."
it ' s located conveniently in the french quarter .
great flavor and not too spicy .
my <UNK> feet were in heaven .
very quick and friendly service .
i also learned that dr <UNK> is internal medicine .
sold by the bottle .
i expected a little more for the price .
that was a bigger joke !
you will love it .
thank you eli ... now to schedule my massages !
"so , this place definitely satisfied our craving ."
"like , really mellow ."
. i had this craving for honey walnut shrimp .
this is n't the place to go .
my kind of people .
that was probably the only complaint .
we enjoyed our visit .
they were smart and professional over the phone .
i loved the green apples in combination with cucumbers .
i think we got there at 00pm !
i was in heaven .
then headed over to pick our order up .
"oh , also , my mackerel was dry ."
there are five empty tables by the way .
"beautiful office , awesome staff ."
love this place - - will definitely come back !
i honestly do not like the food here .
"service , ambiance , food ... you name it !"

"halfway through , i was already full ."
great drinks - they ' re strong and yummy !

baklava is homemade and so delicious .
everything about it is perfection .

i was so thirsty but desperate for a bathroom .
they even offer discounts to sp members .
"oh village square , you have my childhood ."
it tasted like <UNK> .
i did n't finish anything .
"as in , more than one piece ."
over all the show is very sensual and fun .
i could n't be happier .
"i may come back , i may not ."
worth it it was !
"not great , just okay ."
my party enjoyed the prix-fixe meals for restaurant week .
zupas was a pleasant surprise .
it definitely put a damper on the evening .
it was definitely filling enough for me .
if you ' re heading to vegas for vacation !
and it ' s centrally located within the casino .
the owner will lie to you .
"lastly , i love their staff ."
also the employees do n't seem happy .
the service is great too .
00 minutes later we had the queso fundido .
"our appetizer , calamari was bland ."
i have a shy bladder .
and the steak was perfect !
plus $ 0.00 rolling rocks all day every day .
the dessert we shared was the raspberry tiramisu .
why are so many customers complaining ?
love this little coffee shop !
the service is outstanding !
a variety of textures and lots of flavors .
i like fennel sausage with a little more flavor .
my favorite mexican restaurant ever .

prices are comparable to these two .
service and atmosphere are excellent !
no coffee in the room .
i continue to recommend everyone there .
i am excited to try the bobby next time .
i recognized her from the pic on yelp !
this library has an atrocious parking situation .
not sure how much lounge chairs are .
their prices were a lil high .
maybe it ' s the atmosphere .
the patio is also dog friendly and huge !
so to the movies we go !
i am very thankful that i did .
you ca n't <UNK> some fried wonton shells ?
then waited over an hour for our order .
"for goodness sake , just go here !"

it is super convenient and is opened 00-0 .
but the food is delicious .
love the retro style and wanted to stay longer .
as for the drinks .
the staff should know all ingredients in the entrees .
but worth the $ 00 .
"unfortunately , my experience was not memorable ."
it tastes like medicine .
he explained the ingredients and said it was <UNK> .
who knew that vegan food could be so tasty ?
it had great presentation and lots of avocado .
thinly sliced fresh meat and always fresh bread .
' ' but fun nevertheless .
<UNK> ' food is n't all that special .
going back for sure !
"quick delivery , big portions , and absolutely delicious ."

the bottle service was fantastic and well worth it !
oh sweet jesus the hot chocolate was good .

beware of the sample platter .
"shrimp noodle , fried wonton , har gow ."
i love capriotti ' s !
he ordered a coffee and was in love .
the <UNK> of the engines is really exciting !
"we left feeling uncomfortable , not going here again ."
"downside like everyone else has said , long line ."
definitely happy with my purchase here .
the <UNK> would get really low .
"it ' s loud , lively , and bright ."
make reservations in advance !

. i just shrugged it off .
"this place is friendly , welcoming and warm ."
stuff sooooo friendly and the sushi was so good .
the potato salad was great too .
the food was delicious !
they also come with a delicious sauce .
i really enjoyed our experience at donovan ' s .
- rrb - and share the orders .
coupons too are cool .
i only managed to eat about half .
you either get them way too mushy or tough .
what a treat it was !
specials listed on blackboard as you enter .
plus its just pretty .
i do not buy produce at any other store .
had to <UNK> toilet handle to stop running .
"good food and drinks , not the best service ."
although we were not greeted upon arriving .
this was a fantastic pizza .
"yay , a new place in the ` hood ."
it was quick and easy .
my car was not even on site .
very impressed with roaring fork !
we ordered 0 fountain drinks at $ 0.00 each !

emily is amazing and ana is great too .
it was flavorful and not too heavy in mayo .
for dessert we had to share .
their almond croissant ... bomb !
we just had to pay for another roll .

the fairmont is ridiculously huge .
few other things to note : 0 .
the only minus for me - no wine list .
so far tried : chocolate coconut .
' ' we ' re <UNK> .
this place was amazing !
it was smallish but opulent .
the mortadella <UNK> was just so-so .
drinks are not included .
they cooked the ribeye as requested to medium rare .
but lesson learned with that one .
i could eat a whole plate of just those !
at that point i was starving .
they ' re always really douchey and rude .
i would probably order from here again .
you walk up and order at the counter .
each level has something different to offer .
i scarfed it all down like a fatty .
"also , the service was pretty much non-existent ."
it was n't crowded either .
we probably waited less then 00 minutes .
their donuts are always fresh and delicious as well .
we also wanted healthy options .
our waitress was very sweet and helpful .
ordered the lamb souvlaki meal and spanakopita appetizer .
"side portions are big , which redeemed the rating ."
love the way it looks !

i ate the mahi salad that was actually filling .
the <UNK> was good - no grit .
free birthday burger and lots of other rewards !
i would recommend getting take out .
take-out closed by then anyway .

i ' ve recently become obsessed with sushi .
clean this place up before you get closed down !
love the sopapillas you get before you leave !
they could n't tell .
the food is decent .
. it was raunchy and hilarious .
tacos el gordo ftw !
i am in love with this dish .
or the flashing red lights ?
i lost my dog .
use your own judgement .
i really enjoy the holiday turkey sandwich .

i highly recommend this restaurant .
<UNK> requires socks for kids and adults .
my new fav by the way !
i enjoy this store .

"until , i saw two cockroaches crawling around ."
this place is 00-00 minutes away from our house .

downright obnoxious and it should be against the law .
i was thoroughly digging on the boys in <UNK> .
our server was very attentive .
i hear they make bagels too !
no salad bar like the other location 0 .
we went here tonight on a whim .

my favorite is chicken piccata .
one of my favorite places to go .
we waited and waited .
we were given adjoining rooms with double beds instead .
writing this is making my mouth water !
this place is great !
you absolutely will not regret it !
my husband ordered the ranch house salad .
the glazed buttermilk donuts are easily my favorite .
so half my roll had no fish on it .
"no phones , purses or cameras either ."
the prices are good as well .
great quality photo booths at reasonable prices .
the rest of them were just too ordinary .
the ambiance is sports / <UNK> .
it ' s not too much or too little .

"back then , the service was alright ."
there is a monthly schedule posted in the bookstore .

no more so than the rest of vegas .
they were so polite and friendly .
my hair grows tremendously with rocky .
roti canal is delicious .
the pasta dishes were average .
"hence , my four stars for <UNK> . convenient !"
it was a normal <UNK> chocolate dessert .
it was however totally worth the wait .
i have no idea .

the husband got pizza and we all liked it .
i emailed pp to ask for a refund .

nice to be able to sit outdoors .
walked out of the restaurant .
new college is gorgeous .
they were on top of everything and very friendly .
how often does that happen ?
it was not my fault .

as far as prices go .
even the rice and beans were special .
another great suggestion for the management to consider .
waitress was sweet and funny .
"actually , everything we ' ve tried is delicious ."

the crispy spinach was light and fresh .
luckily our waitress was great .

none of that clubby snobbery here !
still just as horrible .
the drink prices were extremely reasonable .
my husband and i love bachi !
the short ribs themselves were fall-off-the-bone good !
for my husbands 00th birthday .
as you can expect it was packed and loud .
there is truly something here for every palate .
i ' m not a picky eater either .
french onion soup - 0 stars .
i ca n't imagine anything less than 0 starts .
i would highly recommend this place !
they were like mini mozzarella sticks .
the extra sauce arrived .
i had a lot .
"btw , i asked - they just laughed ."
"most weekends , the class was pretty full ."
"overall , i really liked the show ."

what the heck happened to their brioche loaf ?
. and the dream became a reality .
"moist brisket , cheesy potatoes and coleslaw delicious !"
especially after spending $ 00 for 0 ppl .
what kind of hotel does that .
its very smooth - not strong at all .
the potstickers were divine .
it tastes like real kobe beef .
this place - while pricey - was absolutely delicious .
they have always taken great care of me .
i could n't eat more than one slider .
i ' m just livid at this point .

but not with rob !
hard to choose from all those amazing flavors .

they sent out a desert with our meal .

and the roasted herb potatoes .
i do n't want someone sugar coating anything .
"half off beer , wine and well cocktails ."
. and there are many vegetarian options !
do i even expect them to follow up .
it was also very tasty though .
"but , after we paid and sat down ."

"he loved his job , he enjoyed being there ."
me and his date both raised our hands .
this restaurant was the highlight of my trip .
"not old , just older young adults ."
"so i paid over $ 0,000 for nothing ."
i assumed it was the same inside .
we learned today that they also cater !
there are n't words to describe it .

overall the experience was pleasant .
the other friend got a beer that he liked .
he truly is good at what he does !
i paid and waited for my food .
my boyfriend ordered the potatoes austin .
"well organized , great staff , amazing experience ."

this place is just lovely !
"fun atmosphere , good sushi , creative rolls ."
both of us ordered the 0 course meal .
the lions are depressing .
"my son , the meat pizza ."
overall a really fun time .
we all really loved the fried zucchini appetizer .
i noticed a churning sound and thought it odd .
i ' m disappointed in myself for this one .
i could n't even finish it .
it was odd how quiet our server was .
asked for no dressing .
they have a great staff !
we will be coming back to order more .
"overall , a definite must try in vegas ."
my car was <UNK> .
the guy suggested i eventually get more ram .
had to send it back it was soo bad .
i like to <UNK> on such classes .
this same lady asked us where we were from .
our waitress tonight was super cute and funny .
do n't even think about ordering to-go .
but the shrimp stole the show .
we had good service and a very good malbec .
"it was always our go to place , weekly ."
you can see it from i - 00 .
we have already gone once with friends this year .
the pasta was al dente .
and then there ' s the bar !
it seems like we were destined to dine there !
i ca n't wait to go again tonight !
no stars for the worst experience ever .
hit this place up last week with my boyfriend .
thanks <UNK> for all that you do .
love the little chandeliers over every table .
they are no busier than any other post office .
the table was sticky and gross .
we had the mozzarella sticks with house-made marinara .
and quite ` ` okay ' ' wine list .
oh baby i need more cheba in my life !
it ' s clean and green .
the restaurant looked decent and the menu looked <UNK> .
the frozen cocktail was refreshing .
saves me from filling up on the bread .
i really like the <UNK> spicy chicken .
"fries were good , too ."
one of my favs for lunch !
"huge smiles , very outgoing ."
"great staff , clean office and quick service ."
no doubt about it .
it is absolutely incredible !
i ate a ton of those .
but the food was just awful .
. manager argued and was unconcerned with my order .
everyone projected a sincere attitude of happy and upbeat .
these were actually really good !
free chips and salsa .
i had the fish and chips .
the macaroni and cheese is especially delicious !
what are the other options ?
the fried rice is actually pretty amazing .
the wings were juicy and flavorful .
you know how jimmy buffet has cheeseburger in paradise ?
this place is meh !
but let me tell you .
i was excited to try them !
best i have ever had .
i would highly recommend them !
our food arrived late and was burned .
i have been impressed with all of the items .
dr neil <UNK> is great !
ahhh delicious and filling !
0 - rrb - octopus - fantastic .
my order is always delivered hot and fresh .
and the cake was cute !
all i can say is yum !
i found that really odd .
so sad because its very close to my house .
pretty awesome deals with free drinks and free entrance .
rib eye was yummy .
the serving size was just right as well .
will definitely be coming back !
the gluten-free menu was actually enticing .
` ` what if we only have cash ?
this place is soooo yummy .
the do have tables towards the back .
the first bite i had was awful .
the food : the dishes speak for themselves .
the tri tip steak was surprisingly tender !
they need more training or something .
i ' m glad i did .
maybe make the shrimp patty a little bigger .
and i love the name !
gigi had a great wedding cupcake .
i am so grateful .
so on and so on .
"he comped the <UNK> plate , which was nice ."
the people that did not do that were boring .
we had the best time .
a must try for beer enthusiasts !
very creative and unique !
and a side of plain yogurt .
' are you kidding me ?
pro tip : try their mojito without simple sugars .
the yum <UNK> was the only saving grace .
we abandoned the ridiculously inadequate system and started fresh !
really made our experience much nicer .
it was tender and juicy - never dry .
they will bring it to you .
you can also check local ads for coupons .
i have tried the frozen yogurt here .
both noodle soups were so tasty !
it ' s officially my fav froyo place .
it was just as i remembered it .
this holds a lot of drink !
will i be back ?
i love 0 guys burgers and fries !
that saves the girls $ on drinks .
it felt like we knew each other forever .
"now , my husband is n't the biggest fan ."
two very different styles of lobster + alfredo pasta .

it was overpowered by oregano .
i definitely recommend it !
very gross for my taste .
still love <UNK> grill .
it turns out that she is the owner !
overall the voices were just not there .
dinner and a show i should say .
i believe they were half priced at that time .
it ' s extremely irritating ... .
the showers were beautiful and relaxing .
i finally made it here for lunch .
' ' she did n't understand that either !
we return to our table to find it empty !
i ' m a switch <UNK> for life !
they even have custard for the <UNK> !
we ' ll be back .
not extremely sweet but still <UNK> your inner child .
you must get the chips and salsa !
we sat at the john wayne booth .
love a conscientious serving team .
a lunch special gets costly .
now that ' s an awesome deal !
it comes with a lovely <UNK> smelling sugar scrub .
this is my regular park .
i was used to one overrun with hispanic chefs .
today was another wonderful experience .
although there were only 0 in his entree .
second time we went was for breakfast .
thank you a & b !
the wildlife zoo has nice aquariums .
mac was ... odd .
would it be as amazing as a cat circus ?
i love black bear diner .
not too salty or with other overwhelming spices .
i . e . mushy and not the best .
but they were real .
"it was okay , but not my favorite ."
it ' s been a week and no problems .
even if you do n't like the beatles !
this is a great place to people watch .
i <UNK> about coming in and ordering super late .
i do n't tolerate that rude customer service shit .
i chose cashew chicken which was not any better .
it was rubbery and was n't cooked well .
very accommodating to groups !
nothing ever gets done at this office .
over the years the service has declined <UNK> !
they had over booked .
i absolutely love their cheesy <UNK> !
this place is ridiculous !
i am bummed that this place closed .
they made small talk and thanked us for coming .
"oh well , more for me !"
i happily paid more for quality - rrb - .
we all liked it !

only sore for about the first 0 days .
i would definitely go here again .

both were delicious and flavorful .
clearly i slept in the other bed .
friends got their shrimp tacos .
i agree with him .
will recommend to my friend comme ã manger <UNK> .
that ' s about all i can say .
no one once apologized .
lobster meat was fishy so i think its canned .
always happy with the drink and food .
luckily the planes taking off and landing entertained us .
i could not stop eating .
the food was good and the waitress was nice .
great allergy friendly restaurant !
"love the lemonade , and the muffins are <UNK> ."
they do n't use any oils in their preparation .
great way to experience jamaican food .
i think thats what it is called !
she does n't treat you like a customer .
same issue with the fish and chips .
0 stars is the best i can give now .
. everything was hot and delicious .
her name is heather and she paints my hair .
"not the taj mahal , but certainly okay ."
my 0rd appt in less than a year .
it was happy hour .
. way beyond what i paid for insect treatment !
we will not be going back .
i love the flavor of their subs !
it ' s good iced as well as warm .
why the heck was this doughnut regular priced ?
"oh yeah , the dessert melted in my mouth !"
i had a taste of everything .
a great club and an alternative to the strip .
do n't know what .
<UNK> was <UNK> their residency that night .
the customer service is amazing too .
i will come back to try the food .
the food is more grey / brown in color .
totally blew me away .
service was great too .

our waiter was impatient .
"hatch , our server , was incredible !"
i will get my fingers into <UNK> here again .
i am so hooked on these macarons !
i are here twice and i love it !
my party of 00 got there around midnight .

there was a void in my life .
i mean come on !
i threw it away after 0 sips .
"she was nice , understanding , and professional ."
the food smelled and tasted delicious .
my mom got the chicken .
pam is absolutely amazing .
the only down side is its a little brown .
and we had good service .
our favorite was the white pizza .
not to mention the pool is absolutely gorgeous !
and they are open fairly early as well .
"the service is extremely fast and friendly , too ."
and if course there where seafood options .
staff us very friendly .
i hope they consider expanding because space is tight !
customer service at it ' s finest !
"bold statement , huh ?"
the vibes were poppin with a big crowd .
again i am so disappointed .
the kitchen looked clean as well .
i agree that this club is way over-rated !
the clams in wine sauce were metallic <UNK> .
ghostbar and playboy club also both have great views !
"overall , the margs were strong and delicious !"
the carpet does n't match exactly ... .
my husband likes the zuzu breakfast casserole .
mashed potatoes were very good ... .
had the pb stuff french toast .
"was n't busy , no biggie ."
the rooms are plush .
my son likes their smoothies .
we sat & talked to the owners until 00ish .

if you missing hawaii grinds check this place out .
the chicken christopher is the most fabulous thing ever !
"of course , my mother replied no ."

this place is absolutely delicious !
thank you for an awesome memory ! !
i always thought our chinatown food was good .

i ca n't wait to go back .
i have all proper paperwork and stickers .
go forth and spend money !
follow them on facebook or twitter !
next i talked to them about his nails .
ordered a a regular margarita .
so so so good !
the prices are <UNK> for the quality you get .
this soup is amazing .
"however , i was n't prepared for this ."
i hate the parking !
"well , these tamales are freaking delicious ."
the ragoons could use more filling .
i do n't love every dish .
everything is tasty and perfect !
they were crispy and literally falling off the bone .
i ca n't rank it as good or bad .
"to start , we shared the risotto balls ."
so of course i asked .
the service is so slow .
overall not my cup of tea .
nice little cafe for lunch .
and food all night long .
my favorite part of my trip to vegas .
we both packed half of our food to go .
our server char was great .
i would go back for dinner .
' ' ` ` have a good night .
not so at venezia ' s !
looked like mushy mess .
two pieces of bread & four olives .
i got the samosas and coconut curry with tofu .
i prefer souffles myself .

"yes , it ' s that good !"
the sandwich bread is fresh and tastes yummy !
the location is fantastic and centrally located to everything .
i ate every last bite on my plate .

the drinks are cheap .
my friends and i also enjoyed the desserts .
i waited a hour for a table .

it was cooked perfectly .
i also love their guacamole and pesto sauce .
we enjoyed both very much .
so there it is .
water with stuff just floating around in it .
everything is so fresh and so good .
my internet does n't work in my room .
for the price point it was a-ok .
this place is amazing !
this place reminded me of the beach .
i love rosati ' s .
shakes are also good by the way !
the cake was delicious and everyone enjoyed it !

everything seemed really heavy .
the sushi rice was seasoned and cooked well .

we got 0 sides that were extra big !
the dim sum is exquisite .
but i would n't pay $ 00 .
the space we had was incredible .
the restaurant itself is a bit unexpected .
would i come back here for food ?
would have given 0 stars except for one thing .
"all in all , i was absolutely devastated ."
but thats clubbing for ya .
in all it was delectable .
it was simple and was perfect for my pallet .
it ' s incredible and i crave it .
i heard he was a regular .
we were not disappointed .
good move having joe making sure everyone is happy !
we will definitely be going back .
the lobby / casino / shopping arcade is beautiful .
i never hang out there .
the <UNK> scene was endearing .
"it was good , and the portions were generous ."
. which was weird to me .
his services were worth every penny i spent !
it has all the things i need .
and the food is delicious !
but the flavor of it was just ok .
have a little more confidence in the people .
everything is so decadent and absolutely delicious .
no trip is complete without a fat tuesday !
the soup was tasty .

lived here for a year in 0000 .
"unfortunately , we are leaving las vegas today ."
probably under some circumstances .
i think that ' s doing it justice .
"the best part , nothing felt heavy / greasy !"

"<UNK> , what am i saying ?"
my mouth is watering just thinking about it .
the tables were nasty .
the calamari lil soggy .
probably just 0 stars for the savoury crepes .
i think that says something in itself ...
we called and made reservations for a thursday night .
i ca n't wait to start using it .
i guess they are individually owned .
we are definitely going back next time .
is this seriously a vegas show ?
best sandwich place ever !
- rrb - or even another guest .
racks and racks and very tight aisles .
it was worth the price .
it was like <UNK> was reading my mind !
maybe not the fish tacos .

we will definitely be back .
thanks restaurant week and napa on providence !

i ended up spending about $ 00.00 .
"overall a wonderful dining experience , though again pricey ."
drinks were not filled until we asked for then .
the most heavenly brunch <UNK> .
the lasers were pretty cool .
my biggest complaint is the variety of music played .

they just have prettier plating .
it was so embarrassing .
warning : they do not accept all coupons .
everyone liked their food .
i love this place .
we had a few awkward moments though .
and then his <UNK> face came out .
the waffles were light and fluffy .
pool bar & grille was good too .
thanks for your help !

the servings are small since they ' re tapas .
"oh , and did i mention the ribs !"
they have a hoppin happy hour as well .

the only thing is that it is over pricey .

to me this place was n't that great .
ah to die for .
le cap vert is an <UNK> but goodie .
what a great band to see here !
we just got back from <UNK> .
the service was fast ... maybe too fast .
"now , cupcakes are a very personal thing ."
all of their made-to-order cocktails are $ 0 .
"the flowers are beautiful , hundreds of orchids ."
small portions that are n't worth the price .
the service at lilly ' s is really good .

so i did not get my x-rays either .
this place is such a mess .
one of the many reasons i love target !
we sat at picnic tables in the enclosed patio .

the village needs more food places that are reasonable .
and the portions are huge !
everything is just so dirty !
for what we paid we expected more .
did n't take my fiance ' s order either !
once again ... happy !
not much peach flavor - only sugar .
the servers are very polite .
our server was friendly but clearly they were understaffed .

i ' ve had mixed experiences .
"the menu is simple , i like that ."
probably better then starbucks not going to lie .

the best tea was the cedar rose .
awesome happy hour as well .
happy hour is 0-0 pm seven days a week !

the tables are so dirty .
"plus , the waitress / bartender was rude ."
i love that burger .
everything was to die for .

i ' m sure it was a fire hazard .
garlic crispy chicken - crack chicken more like .

my <UNK> would have new phone and pod cases .
the hostess was super nice .
the cocktail shrimps were okay .
we left with our plates full of food .

"however , one day i stumbled upon this location ."

and cops coming in giving tickets .
next time - adovada benedict .
the staff is super quick and friendly !
that area really sucks .
the staff are very nice and accommodating .

this location is off the strip .
our friend ' s meal was meh .

i have eaten there twice and very impressed !
lucky strike would rock in old town .
the driver was also super sweet and very nice .
skinnyfats is way better and cheaper !
the elote was really good .
walking up to the front door was a sign .
all i can say is awesome place .
but she is learning so much more .
some of the best sushi in town !
theirs was hard and dry .
i am addicted to <UNK> ' s .
' ' she asked ... .
' ' in a very sarcastic / rude tone .
i was not disappointed .
it had a great combination of flavors .
i ' m a fan !

why fix it if it ai n't broke ?
you can never go wrong with this restaurant !
the potato ' s were alright but nothing special .
each popcorn is completely covered in cheese or caramel .
we rode on an <UNK> .
i thought the staff was very rude and unprofessional .
by far my favorite salad bar is in chi-town .
there was a generous amount of mozzarella on top !

<UNK> is pretty much the best thing ever .

we really like this place .
the hamachi sashimi is fresh and vibrant .
that was all settled however .
i had the chance to try everything ... wow .
love the interior & ambiance .
it ' s more like ice milk ?
i could drink that stuff !
the layout is so simple .
"id rather have my mind blown , as usual ."
but unfortunately it does n't have views of it .
they always have quirky events going .
i was n't impressed .
there are so many choices .
best thing is they are open 00 hours .
"the prices , however , are my biggest beef ."
great taste and excellent price !
"please do n't change , <UNK> !"
i do not recommend this place to anyone .
the smell makes your mouth water in anticipation .
"and , and ... fried olives !"
"the best , ever ."
i would definitely come back here again !
we wo n't be back .
. friggin disgusting - <UNK> again !

do not stay here .
the shrimp was decent but nothing special .
bartender and i had a great discussion about whiskey .
i was very excited to see it .
perhaps we stayed in two very different hotels .
i tried samples of several flavors and yuck .

he was too wary to go back for more .
now let ' s talk beignets .
now i ' m 0/0 !
noodle that we ordered is a bit dry .
front desk staff were friendly .
so we started immediately .
- rrb - and everyone was super friendly .

they are unwelcoming and unfriendly .
i have 0 months warranty .
defiantly do n't recommend it .
nothing to shout about .

the whole experience is fantastic .
it baffles me that they loose money every season .
picture a chipotle but with pizza .
whiskey cake ? ! sign me up !
music is just <UNK> loud !
0 stars for a walgreens you ask ?
i loved the fries more .
"in addition , i added on salmon ."

i ' m giving this 0 stars .
all of it was delicious .
i guess i just expected more .
the best coffee shop in summerlin
"warm and inviting , comfortable seating , beautiful scenery ."

the arcade games are free .
let ' s talk inconsistent acting .
i love this place .
three people at dinner .
the blt is one of our favorites .
it ' s charming and homey .
unfortunately this was a miss for us .
my husband and i do n't have kids .

set up this event .
and my favorite part : the date shake !
im absolutely in love with my used mazda <UNK> .
i turned to yelp to find a dry cleaners .
it is ... so .
i opted for the 0 oz .
. a perfect place to celebrate a special occasion .
"also , this restaurant is only open for dinner ."
they may have multiple brands .
. just to be told no .
food is still good .
forgive me for being cheap .
we come here every time we go to vegas .
even though it ' s not an outlet store .
the lighting and decor are very calming and inviting .
their bakery is hands down the best .
they have awesome veggie burritos !
then this is your place !
i recommend the quiche and seafood bouillabaisse .
- rrb - to their house as a treat .
prices are great also .
maybe i went on an off day .
she loved it without being too embarrassed !
be <UNK> to eat outside .
"dr . brent cameron , nd is awesome !"
rice was blah and dry .
for my entree i ordered the shrimp scampi .
"it ' s small , for vegas ."

waitresses were speedy and friendly .
same options with their all white meat tasty tenders .
but if the service end is unreliable ... .
best greek salad in town !
the food was amazing for its price .
every staff person we interacted with was super friendly .
it went down easy !

"awesome , awesome , awesome !"
sold - and it ' s great food !
we come here often !
calamari was very fresh but a little rubbery .
the food was fabulous .
i was expecting something spectacular and was disappointed .
completely awful car service .
' ' and walked away .
please open another location !
he talked really slow and sluggish .
i highly recommend this company and especially josh !
the service is wonderful .
` ` meh ' ' was the general consensus .
the bag needed more sauce for sure as well .
menu was a bit overwhelming with so many choices .
they were on time .
and these were mighty breakfasts !
that ' s always a good thing .
turns out even their verbal <UNK> are dubious .
i would stay there again anytime .
i enjoyed most everything i put on my plate .
"do n't miss this place , whatever you do !"
took forever to be acknowledged .
so much for serenity .
both dishes were delicious .
we were not disappointed .
thank you for the lunch .
will return at least twice a week !
the chili was delicious !
also the jr high youth group is very awesome !
it was very runny and <UNK> tomato based .
like a <UNK> ' s pizza !
they made some effort .
dessert - white chocolate bread pudding with creme anglaise .
the caramel black and white did not disappoint .
"upon entering bamboo , the atmosphere is nice ."
"but besides that , fuego bistro is fantastic !"
the staff was great !
it was very bland and salty .
i will never go back again .
"this is a wonderful new , little bakery ."
waited a while til she came over .
i had such a great time here .
or a bartender that did n't know his inventory ?
the staff was friendly and real .
plenty of shops and restaurants around the resort .
they were still letting others on the board .
definitely recommend this place ! !
its small and there is no where to sit .
they need to stick around !
i ' ve never ordered anything else here before .
i ' m definitely coming back .
she is my idol !
customer service was good .

creamy and homemade tasting .
"no lines , super clean , and friendly service !"
our food took at least 00 minutes to arrive .
tried to give this place a chance .
when we arrived we were sent back very quickly .
no i do n't want more .
my husband and i finally decided to try monta .
i just ca n't say enough good things !
"so , definitely go there ."
he was also empathetic for our loss .
"great prices , great atmosphere , great service !"
. definitely coming back .
i got the bacon bar for a friend .
oh and the garlic naan was so <UNK> !
i even got a photo with the chef !
very cool of him .
i went during weekend brunch .
you can afford to take your family there !
but the food made up for it !
wish they had pineapple fritters or potatoes scallops .
my favorite was a the entertainer named vanilla .
they have many yummy options .
the pools are open 00/0 .
they were quite tiny but at least fresh .
mushy slop and not visually appealing .
she did an amazing job !
he made me feel important to him and valued .
we had delivery and it was timely .
very crispy and flavorful .
"i know , i ' m the worst ."
grilled veggies are the best !
and that was apparently a discount .
i was never told that on the phone .
my instructor was so nice and so helpful .
lots of parking in the lot as well .
so major points on being on time .
this hotel is a must stay in charlotte !
the aioli with wasabi was the perfect creaminess .
it would be great on pretzels .
food was fresh and hot and very good .
its such a fun little store !
the owner was lovely .
such a romantic feel and location .
"and , this was it ."

it is like a dessert tea .
"they always have low prices , with a catch !"
hidden gem worth visiting over and over again ! !

i am drooling just thinking about it !
suddenly everyone is ordering sandwiches .
yum in my tums !
"talk about a diabetic coma , but worth it !"
i loved everything about the class .
she is so sweet and on top of it !
everything is extremely fresh and flavorful .
check-in was a breeze .
ordered milk for my kids which tasted weird .
never a long line to get in .
they made sure we did n't miss a beat .
touristy and homey at the same time .
it also did n't include woodwork or ceilings .
i always order sashimi .
the unexpected location of this restaurant surprised us .
the lady behind the counter was super nice .
the staff is friendly and attentive .
good winnings as well .
we wo n't be going back .
"the restaurant was , sadly , quite empty ."
the mac and cheese was amazing !
had to leave before it got fixed .
the food and coffee drinks are d'lish though !
and its peaceful and relaxing .
my experience getting pierced by robert wilson was fantastic !
i did n't see anyone doing that .
i have to say i absolutely love this location !
the store seems understaffed and the employees are unhappy .
their happy hour menu is equally delicious !
i will definitely be back .
"but overall , we enjoyed our food ."
my burger came out kinda charred .
i ca n't wait to try this place again !
we also had chips and salsa for an appetizer .
not bad at all !
disappointed we order alternate meals .
the prices are so reasonable .
i had the beef wellington which was perfect .
nothing that wowed me .
my friends and i recently went to vegas .
i have never had bad service .
my biggest issue is the the wait time .
i ' ve never seen such a great selection .
staff is very nice and helpful .
i would rather go to the onion barn .
i love this place .
and then there are the other ones .
that ' s on their happy hour menu .
especially during the summer this really hits the spot .
packed over the weekends !
they swore they could do gluten free pizza .
<UNK> was the cross training trainer .
now add to that an amazing amount of noise .
left before we even got to see calvin .
you can never trust them .
it hit the spot and was good .
i would recommend this one for kids too .
so many people were complaining .
i had the boeuf bourguignon .
our server sierra was fantastic and a total sweetheart .
"wow , go dogs !"
it ' s a red wine that was delicious .
love this spot great <UNK> !
so i was missing that part .
some of the aisles are weird .
on a friday night .
the venetian is just beautiful .
"well , is n't that special ."
their hamburgers are delicious .
i have never experienced such great customer service before .
from the start we were treated like royalty .
room left a bit to be desired .
the trio of lamb is tender and well seasoned .
no seasoning or anything .
... and soooo yummy ~ !
this is tasty and usually lasts 0 meals .
the desert table was fabulous .
always worth a star for me !
i love this place .
they dig deeper than just your symptoms .
the chandelier proved me wrong .
parmesan risotto was too loose and tasted weirdly sweet .
i ordered half a meatball hoagie .
i really love their sourdough bread .
fantastic fast-casual mediterranean food !
we started off with drinks and an appetizer .
it came with corn tortillas and sour cream .
thanks for wasting our time .
the manager <UNK> is wonderful !
they have a great selection of food and bakery .
the sauce is spicy and rich and creamy .
"would i return , yes ."
it was sooo good !
keep your yard drink cups for discounted refills .
happy to have <UNK> in the neighborhood !
obviously was n't too overjoyed to be there .
probably because of the weather .
this place is def .
"so , why 0 stars ?"
the sesame chicken was my favorite .
"clean seating area , friendly wait staff ."
- lrb - maybe a touch of celery .
if you want to feel panic go eat there .
i love the <UNK> with a veggie dog .
"exceptional service , professional staff , and great prices !"
"hell , a quiche would have excited me ."
new waiter came and called us guys .
now we must try serendipity in nyc !
i think the mushrooms were overpowering .
they all three had a really great time !
i just have mixed feelings .
i do n't ` ` believe in chiropractic .
we have a standing order at this location .
u can trust him & talk to him anytime .
lots of fresh garlic which we just love !
- rrb - brixx also has bogo coupons everywhere !
sushisamba seriously needs to retrain their staff .
and the price was definitely right !
they were more meaty and not soggy .
"it was pretty busy , with people waiting outside ."
also the shrimp rolls .
seriously my frappe was chocolate water disgusting !
i guess that is good customer service .
my favorite place to ` ` drink .
antonio was on time and got right to work .
"soup , salad and breadsticks ."
they even offered us complimentary <UNK> and dessert .
walked in here for a late lunch last saturday .
just topped how unprofessional they were in the community .
the other terrible situation is the number of bathrooms .
my husband and i both ordered the rib eye .
i called lost & found .
it made <UNK> eaters become overnight fans .
so why the 0 stars ?
the menu literally has something for everyone .
not sure we will be back .
everyone is always so friendly .
went to the pharmacy here today .
i did n't love the <UNK> though .
the jicama fries are plain out bad .
the outside & inside is gorgeous !
i am a shopper after all .
<UNK> minutes passed and we only get drinks ?
"black and white checker tile , dark wood tables ."
now i ' m not some .
who am i kidding ?
' ' and so on .
"the best , love it !"
this is one of the best free things around .
and the staff really friendly .
most likely quite awhile .
love trader joe ' s ... any of them !
the veggie was awesome !
the pancakes were light and the blueberry were fresh .
waiter was quite helpful .
it melts in your mouth .
it ' s always phenomenal .
just wish i ' d brought more comfy shoes .
the food was delicious .
they ruined my wedding reception !
all because of the park .
i did n't care for it one bit .
juice selection was good and good customer service .
crab puffs are excellent .
this is a fantastic company .
so i wait for a indoor table .
my boyfriend and i each ordered the boss hog .
be warned they charge for sharing .
the bowl is a huge serving !
i asked if there was a reason .
i absolutely love this place .
i <UNK> on kimchee but it was still amazing !
so i shared the greek omelette with my nephew .
oj was $ 0.00 .
. maybe the smell .
we ordered quickly and the bartender was prompt .
when we walked in we were very pleased .
worth the drive down to chandler .
it ' s not the <UNK> animal hospital .
- rrb - steak tacos were delish .
very disappointed in the way we were treated .
"rude manager , her name is kara ."
shower had no door .
nothing tasted fresh here .
the food was delicious .
he kids devoured it .
. i think i almost cried .
maybe like chunks of banana or something in it ?
veggies did n't look good - organic or conventional .
this is such a spot .
the flamenco dancer was enjoyable to watch .
i think that ' s a pretty cool concept .
"once again , we are not ` ` guys !"
we had the yellowtail sashimi which was very good .
prices are very similar and affordable .
we took it to go .
we left because it was a joke .
do n't bother going anymore .
"overall , <UNK> cantina was ok ."
waitress forgot to place appetizer order .
she always comes out to say hi .
the prices are very reasonable .
. the bartender was super sweet and friendly .
the restaurant was not busy .
i did n't feel intimidated at all .
thank you so much !
you can not go wrong with dose !
best chinese food delivery in tempe .
i will definitely be returning again .
we went here not to long ago .
creamy soup with chunks of seafood .
"he acted rushed , impatient and rude ."
fresh raw fish is my main criteria !
the one on rainbow is so ghetto .
very considerate and timely !
the beans were delicious .
the white pizza was n't what i expected .
"brilliant , i tell you ."
"for 0.0 hours , rarely checked in on us ."
black cod lettuce wraps 0 .
so despite the congestion i will come back .
i used to love their food omg .
everything was tasty and prepared as ordered .
"within 00 minutes , our number was called ."
their staff is also just magnificent !
just be ready to eat it standing up .
i am actually very impressed !
i decided on the caprese sandwich .
"new , chic and hip lounge in vegas !"
"well , i dreamed haha ."
tanzy was my first stop for spring restaurant week .
"and oh yes , soy was an option ."
"the food was fresh , hot and tasty ."
she has always been helpful and nice .
i tried this place several times .
nothing spectacular at all .
the desserts were not memorable .
moral - get wayyyy more for your money elsewhere .
it was pretty awful .
that itself was worth it !
only wish i had time to get another one !
she was very sweet lady .
"i went to register today , and nope ."
definitely will be back again to try something new !
and there was no wait !
you ' ll love it .
az famous dave ' s is where it happens !

we were treated so wonderfully .
nothing better to start the day !
the food came out within ten minutes .
service here was great !
if i had to guess ... .
"the presentation was horrible , they tasted even worse ."
"very welcoming , modern and an overall cool vibe ."
they book up fast !
one of my favorites .
i highly recommend it .
but i found myself literally <UNK> .
i think the cornbread just seriously set it off .
thank you paper & home !
thank you for a yummy dinner .
the veggie burro is my favorite .
we sat at the bar .
loved the location at atmosphere of this place !
he and his staff are amazing !
would go back for sure .
their bread is delicious and hot .
"and sadly , i do n't drink much anymore ."
fast service - once you get a table .
"i asked my <UNK> , wtf is that ?"
we got a suite in rush tower .
excellent doctor and the medical staff .
it should n't even be called a greek salad .
i could probably make 0 meals out of it !
so we opted for a table .
you can get pretty much anything here .
i ordered the bf chow fun and egg rolls .
the farm sessions concept i loved .
the goat cheese also was n't crumbled .
my stomach still hurts from eating it .
each comedian was great .
that ' s when all the nightmare began .
tortilla s are awesome and beans are yummy .
it ' s always packed .
i will never ever go to this place again .
duh that ' s a given .
i love their late hours !
- wagyu skirt steak : what the what !
it was really good .
it had a great combination of flavor .
the salon was packed and looked like a zoo .
the blueberry glaze complimented the cronut nicely .
finally after an hour we were in the car .
first visit to phoenix & first-time watching basketball game !
the sandwiches and homemade deli salads are delicious .
over priced for the quality .
i am a big fan of tea .
they <UNK> and dimed us to death .
it ' s a large pizza with one topping .
it ' s not over !
the staff is very nice .
we kind of wished we had the tall girl .
"lastly , we shared the vanilla profiteroles for dessert ."
this is a great deal to take advantage of .
food : really bad .
"overall , i ' d go back ."
"they had wine tastings there , sample a few ."
the location itself is great for a private event .
' ' and that ' s it .
"it was decent , and it filled me up ."
really on a soup kick these days .
i have tried a few now for different occasions .
they have something for everyone .
fried gyoza - it was a little soggy .
"perfect , especially for $ 0.00 ."
i do n't know .
first time i have ever not left a tip .
the spa is beautiful !
we had a great server too .
i liked it almost as much as the book .
i ' m still drooling over that one .
<UNK> is the best too .
it was so unique !
our server was great and attentive .
duh ? ! the venue itself is pretty ok .
mormon central thats for sure !
0 - rrb - <UNK> - muffin meets cupcake .
i will go back again .

this restaurant was a complete disappointment .
the caramel drizzle was a perfect addition .
the bartenders are very accommodating and friendly .
nothing but a slice of heaven !
i love flame broiler .
' ' there goes my only first review !
i guess cpk with the kids again .
"instead , we got nothing ."
the garlic butter is her favorite on pasta .
i seldom drink water .
room was nicer and more spacious than expected .
waiting in line for drinks is a <UNK> alone !
everything was freshly prepared and tasted amazing .
our go to place !
great dinner and cocktails .
what happened to being conscious about the environment .
we told the waitress they did nothing about it .
for dinner i decided on the lamb jasmine .

my friends and i arrived around 00:00 pm .
"also , the dj was great ."

sounds like a perfect day to me !
amazing hummus platter and lamb shank .

and the food is wonderful .
i loved them all !

staff is very kind and courteous as well !
their red hot sauce is also key .
quiet thai place with good food !
a fun <UNK> alternative to your average brunch !
i appreciated the honesty and ethical problem solving .
"i mean , i love coffee ."
"that being said , i love this place ."
they do n't usually have deals .
sitting outside and enjoying champagne was heavenly .
then things go downhill .
i live 0 miles from the location .
the kicker was the wine menu .
i had the everything bagel with cream cheese .
grapes imported from ca .
there are n't any squishy comfy armchairs .
"the sandwich was delicious , the bread crunchy ."
it makes the meatball sandwich so much better .
i ' m still thinking about that custard .
he ' s a <UNK> for christ sake !
it was just ok .
it is a nice guide to the gardens .
their drinks looked great .
"besides tasting good , the food is presented beautifully ."
are they really that unprepared ?
we have made this a weekly spot .
"my favorite is the magic bar , $ 0.00 ."
definitely would refer this store and bill .
two things : 0 .
my favorite is their spaghetti .
<UNK> and drained we packed up to leave .
but i just did n't get the hype .
their cocktail list is really inventive and yummy !
well that is gone .
"okay , you caught me ."
"love , love , love !"
my only qualm : drinks are a little pricey .
i ' ve been to vegas a few times .
this is my new fav spot .
i will be going back hopefully sometime soon .

marc <UNK> is definitely talented at his trade .
"when the entrees came , everything was fine ."
dressing was just right .
we stopped at bubba d ' s .
i asked for a variety of tofu and seafood .
then <UNK> is your place !
"overall , i liked this experience ."
"shame on you , salt ."
it tasted light and healthy .
extremely upset with this company .
located outside on the strip .
perfect for hungry boys at lunch !

stumbled across this place and so glad i did !
i love the huge pink cow .
chicken was stringy and moist - perfectly done !
maybe someone can help me out there .
food was great - service was so-so .

my hubby ' s pizza was a greasy mess !
the fries are steak fries !
. he absolutely enjoyed it .

- lrb - what a bunch of jerks !

the servers are nice and the place is adorable .
"if you tried it before , try it again !"
' ' that was her answer .
unfortunately we wo n't be back .
this review is specifically for the pictures with santa .
the fish freshness and the ikura was really nice .
"from start to finish , we felt absolutely special ."
you can just be ... adorable !
had to move once to escape them !
they are always understaffed .
prices are more than fair .
honestly i would n't come here again .
the service was great and very attentive .
i would highly recommend coming here .
the best thai food in town hands down !
my tongue is still recovering from the <UNK> .
i love black with blue lighting .
very mediocre peruvian food .
i went here on a recommendation of a friend .

and 0 for ambiance .
"she is sweet , friendly , and efficient ."
i trust them with any body work !
"also , other people are commenting on the decor ."
good prices and wonderful staff .
our server was attentive and accommodating .
he pointed to a room and i went in .
for me it does n't really matter either way .
not my favorite airline .
there is a great ball pit .
the calamari came and it was beyond salty .

the service from our waiter was strange .
she understood but it was the owners call .
there ' s no sign .
i ate the whole thing !
"0 bathrooms , too !"
my daughter introduced us to this bakery last night .
it had just enough crunch and flavor to it .
this food is great !

the zoo is amazing and has something for everyone .
i would recommend paradise carpet to anyone i know !
or business met up .
needless to say - it was a saturday funday !
this was my first time for boba !
there was enough for one spoonful for each person .
a pair of earrings i received for christmas .
she gave us a booth in the back right .
alicia was her name .
it was n't too much or too little food .
we finished our meal with smooth espressos and cappuccinos .
this place is great !
i attended a free workshop on <UNK> <UNK> .
we called her ` ` the coin fairy .
"either way , i love this place ."
"it was pricy , but i did n't mind ."
prime rib was just okay .
i do n't know .
i ca n't say enough good things about it .
the food was great .
really oddly laid out .
tender and moist enough to not be bad .
also the apple cinnamon butter is fantastic !
there were two problems actually .
my kitties got to have all sorts of <UNK> !
the pizza is super crispy and fresh .
this was just bad .
they brighten your day .
the staff was nice and our room was spotless .
"* yes , you should try it !"
"really cool atmosphere , great drink menu ."
it had a slightly grainy texture to it .
we shared the fajitas for two .
everything we ate was divine .
"anyways , give this place a try !"
it kinda tasted like christmas .
"however , my second experience at <UNK> was awful ."
sometimes not enough parking .
they do n't have enough clips for the <UNK> .
it was clean too .
the rolls were like store bought .
even at 0:00 in the morning .
chelsea ' s kitchen is a great place !
i would recommend then to anyone and everyone !
never go to this place !
"if he ' s there , snatch him up !"
i am surprised by the bad reviews !
overall i was underwhelmed .
. loved it 0 .
we chose to sit at the bar .
it is super tasty .
first of all i loved the frozen yogurt !
i ordered the <UNK> burger and an oreo shake .
ya think they ' d advise the passengers !
my date had the flatbread .
' ' was it horrible ?
i would come here again !
they even told her their names when she asked .
very shameful to call them selves a mexican restaurant !
perfect panoramic view of the city and edinburgh castle .
we danced til the band went home .
everyone ' s entitled to a bit of fun !
i called him on a thursday .
the girls were really helpful and knowledgeable .
i was scared by how much food there was .
i will never go anywhere else .
i just had dinner here .
i love these guys !
the staff is friendly and the atmosphere is homey .
that was not the case at postino .
we tried all new dishes ... .
their food is pretty good .
we wo n't be back to this location .
"it was just one potato , not even cut ."
do n't be a <UNK> about it .
an awesome location for the 00000 zip code .
the ceremony site overlooked the beautiful gold course .
it was beyond my expectations .
"very few people there , now we know why ."
"i wanted chicken , beef , fish , shrimp ."
exceptional service from a local company !
it was also cold ... and pricey !
nothing to compliment it on .
the worst company ever !
and their breakfast sandwiches are delish !
"seriously , though , this candy store is great ."
i could have eaten a whole plate of those !
well it ' s extremely sweet !
an almond something ... perfect .
the food is fresh and healthy .
our waitress was terrible .
looking forward to my return .
our go to place for celebrations .
the flat bread was a great compliment to it .
no meal voucher while everyone is waiting .
now that ' s how it should be done !
i ' ve tried this place twice .
"try it enchilada style , even better ."
not a fan of the chef whatsoever .
my order seems to always get messed up .
the fish chowder was just mediocre .
the music is too damn loud !
teriyaki madness is my guilty pleasure .
good variety of dim sum and ambiance is authentic .
went here for brunch with my family .
that was the only good thing about it .
great products and service !
would definitely go back again !
can you beat mix and match six packs ?
i ' ve been here before .
what makes this place so great ?
my mouth is watering .
i love this place .
maybe it ' s different at dinner .
i didnt love it .
"needless to say , we were very displeased ."
soaking tub and separate shower .
"the employees are helpful , nice and knowledgeable ."
what ? ! that really peeved me off .
it was jam packed with veggies and won tons .
will not be coming back .
hard to come by at a buffet .
especially when they bring in their staple irish bands .
the custard is to die for .
i love everything about this chick-fil-a !
i had pad thai that was so watery .
bagels & lox i am so there again !
we like their fajitas best .
do n't waste your money .
i never had pho before and it was fantastic .
there are also lots of photo opportunities inside .
"yes , it is expensive ."
did it all on paper with pencil .
. been going here for years !
i went here because i wanted something new .
you should eat here !
the pork chops were just okay .
servers were sweet and attentive .
i had mama ' s chicken holy smokes !
this place has everything !
i was given <UNK> i think ?
"i liked the dessert , but husband did n't ."
the worst of our experience ?
i had the portabello veggie wrap .
you pay at the counter at the end .
it is worth the wait .
and they did not disappoint !
the grilled cheese was apple bacon and some gouda .
it ' s so classy !
"the view was magnificent , of course ."
so i choice the steak and shrimp .
the best thing was the oversized brazilian punch cocktail .
they also have an old west photo studio .
all the stuff on their menu was overpriced .
you guys got ta order these !
. i really did want to like you !
food was great also .
not a happy customer !
the food was delicious .
"our friends will be back , too !"
wow the menu looks amazing .
the food tastes like love and pride .
the drinks are amazing .
"they were kind , caring and accommodating ."
i had salmon and he had the filet .
they are thick like a steak fry .
we used them several times .
the side vegetables were also interesting .
so no reason not to check it out !
i believe the hype !
a perfect night out in a perfect city !
and we needed to get a reception venue .
i just wish they had baked goods .
we even asked her ... are you sure ?
then we stopped completely .
best splurge of our trip .
she made me actually like this place .
will order that next time .
service can be spotty .
this place has a great happy hour !
"pop a mint , honey !"
we will not be returning to rehab .
one new slide in 0 years ?
this is such a welcome store in the community .
"very disappointed and will not be returning , ever ."
i want to go back so bad .
which is fine by me .
and they were super fast as well .
drive-thru is what caught my eye !
the reviews are accurate - stay away !
i love the refried black beans .
need to use <UNK> water .
water bottles are all free .
i particularly enjoyed the union <UNK> hefe .
this restaurant got all the right stuff .
"sadly , they were just ok ."
the coconut ice cream was sooooo good .
the service was wonderful all three times .
i would stay again .
needless to say i ' m hooked .
i ' m sure their creations are highly tested .
"cute store , but overpriced ."
every item was amazing .
this was one of my favorites !
the chicken and waffles and the scampi were delicious .
we have been back twice since finding this gem .
the <UNK> <UNK> dessert was heavenly though ... .
such a light and refreshing roll .
apparently my last review was <UNK> .
i walked in on friday night to order takeout .
i wish they sold them by the pound .
this might have been my favorite thing we ordered .
the service was great .
the food is delicious .
prices were also reasonable .
i ' ve had better .
i ' ll find another clinic nearer .
especially during happy hour !
the sole was a hit !
they said it was great food and reasonable prices !
"first , vegan options ."
then ordered the shrimp appetizer .
overall we were pretty satisfied .
they also had tons of water .
that was pretty shady and lame .
i will never come back here .
the staff is so nice and welcoming .
the atmosphere upon arrival is very classy and romantic .
it is beyond horrible .
"i 000 % recommend <UNK> , without a doubt !"
of course : table side guacamole !
one of my favorite hotels in vegas .
the best vegan food in vegas !
grand lux cafe is literally inside the palazzo .
drinks were on ipads which was cool .
"<UNK> meals , all delicious and mouthwatering ."
parking was very limited .
they had to take it back to fix it .
very flavorful and large portions .
the appetizer was a trio of appetizers .
the staff is friendly and the salon is clean .
every time i come here .
i could eat two of those !
but my fiancã © loved it .
but i loved it .
the waitress / server was extremely nice and helpful .
one word ` ` heavenly ' ' beds .
i mean all of vegas smells like smoke .
in my opinion <UNK> bordering on rude .
had the mint chocolate chip gelato .
my husband loves the club !
i do n't know ?
our waitress <UNK> was horrible .
trust me just come here !
"in fact , our rooms were on different floors ."
they also <UNK> while you wait ! ! beautiful place
but you pay for the food you get !
they are so innovative with their ideas .
"caramel room , awful !"

we love the <UNK> daddy .
i could n't agree more !
two hours later we still had no food .
email us back and address our concerns .

it was love at first sight .
this place is like pizza hut .
there was no real flavor to it at all .
not friendly at all ...
<UNK> taking the best of you .
we left smelling like smoke and were super stuffed .
i am addicted to their super turkey sandwich .
the only thing <UNK> me was the thunder ... .

"fast , inexpensive and professional ."
it is worth the drive from the strip .
the menu has something for everyone .
"service was okay , dinner was crowded and small ."
service was alright enough .
we all enjoyed our experience here immensely !
the service was good .
the lunch staff was very friendly and helpful .
i even get happy faces on my receipt .
it helps spread the avocados into each bite !
they give you a good portion sizes .
the flowers made her very happy .
this is the best pizza place ever !
one was behind the register .
. do not try to walk .
love server denise here and food is great .
"yes , the parking is a pain ."
downtown is annoying that way .
"all in all , love <UNK> ' s ."
still would not give him any antibiotic .
i would give them 0 stars .
nothing can or will compare to it !
our service was great !
they agreed to that and they came out okay .
wo n't be back .
it was light and completely satisfying .
the service is nice and friendly and fast !
so the menu changes .
she would not let me in .
someone else came and dropped off bread .
the veggie soup was good but salty .
". however , this was a sore disappointment ."
it was really disgusting .
<UNK> our waitress was attentive .
not to mention the prices are high .
not that the server cared or noticed .
they also have a juice and snack bar .
which does n't sound tempting .
they were pretty decent .
we will be back again soon .
if you love pie this spot is a must !
i hate the noise !
that entire process was very frustrating and chaotic .
this was n't even having the tasting menu .
"they are upfront about the fee , but seriously ?"
"i ' ve had their macaroons , love them ."
their outside seating needs improvement .
"little food , little drink , decent service ."
you can tell that everything is fresh .
the gym and pool looked decent .
i ' ve always loved the paris .
so mellow and laid back .
our friends upgraded ... .
loved the table for my handbag .
she was very professional and apologetic .
the lady behind the counter was very nice .
the sections are typically organized everything is sectioned off .
i ' m typing as i ' m eating .
i prefer more savory fare in the mix .
we were a little disappointed in the selection .
not a lot but hopefully he gets all .
all in all i love this place .
"about $ 0 for lunch , not including drinks ."
i asked her how she felt about my weight .
the cheese sauce permeated every nook and cranny .
mmmmm cocktails : moscow mule was refreshing and nice .
same goes for the garlic cheese bread .
i could have gotten that anywhere .
i loved the taro boba milk tea .
the way back was not as smooth .
"overall , i was sad when leaving ."
the ramen with veggies was great !
the server was very friendly and helpful .
i would definitely go back for a second run .
i barely knew this store existed .
"even bbq , hot pot and etc . ."
gross tempe sewer smell in store as well .
then she took our food order .
we found 0 pieces .
it had kind of burlesque vibe .
. only $ 00 something including champagne .
service was pretty good .
"great crust , the pizza was delicious !"
"at that point , i was pissed ."
but it is expensive for the amount you get .
"go here , people ."
the couple we were with decided on ordering brunch .
"good coffee , too ."
but i wo n't be returning .
he was very bubbly and charismatic .
' ' she said ` ` he swears .
"eh , not so much ."
would recommend this place !
i love my new tint .
... it was ... meh .
"~ nicole , surprise az"
we always order the penne pasta with pink sauce .
chompie ' s is home to my favorite soup !
they got rid of stains as well as dirt .
the menu had a good selection of choice ... .
i thought that was weird .
. omg im getting hungry just thinking about it .
i recommend this place to anyone and everyone !
happy happy happy place .
our daughter recommended this restaurant to us .
. not even people lmao <UNK> brunch !
. nope you will not be using that .
i recommend the strawberry .
the shower was nicely tiled at least .

eddie is awesome as well !
its got security so your car is protected .
we ' ll be coming back !
i walked away - lrb - ha !
too bad because they have good prices .
we had great service .
no more sneezing running nose .
i do n't think so .
this delivery i would give 0 stars .
the sea bass is perfection .
the flavor of the meat was marinated perfectly .
they were both kinda dry to me .
sapporo has been a family favorite for years .
one roll particularly stood out for me .
the burgers were great !
"great dj , helped make my wedding magical !"
definitely never coming back ! ! !
"absolutely delicious , ca n't say enough ."
we will be back !
the <UNK> and pine nuts were a good combination .
maybe because there are more bouncers then anything else .
i do n't want any .
could just be me ... .
but inside ... what a line !
i must say i really enjoyed it .
i did not bother to finish it .
breadsticks with <UNK> butter - yum !
"for me , the peppermill was just ok ."
see <UNK> r . ' s review to come .
maybe on our 0th visit !
they even carry some snacks .
we ended up just getting drinks .
definitely not an ideal brunch .
drive thru was packed so we walked in .
the mashed potatoes were divine .
it is ghetto indeed !
we sat outside on the awesome patio .
"the hand-cut fries were great , too !"
"the hefe was delish , too !"
along with alicia who works at the front desk .
it came out too salty .
random : the pretzel bites are the bomb .
you ca n't charge it to your room .
i will not be returning .
"anyway , it ' s all good ."
i had to come try this place .
sad that it was n't a better first impression .
he is an amazing hair stylist .
"whichever , the service is great !"
first time trying this restaurant .
and glad to find it i was .
' ' so they just brought the soup .
he was so efficient and thorough with the process .
our server was attentive and persistent .
the line moved pretty fast tho .
"anyway , i do n't really recommend this place ."
maybe this restaurant caters to a more caucasian palate .
this place has it down to a science .
"if i could give more stars , i would !"
ambiance is fun and festive .
the chipotle sauce on top gave a nice kick .
we had the steak and eggs special .
we had the cheesecake and apple tart <UNK> .
the chocolate thin mint was good .
the reduction sauce that came around it sounded interesting .
the chips on the table were greasy and flavorless .
i did both last night .
"they ' re good , whatever they are !"
i was a very happy camper indeed .
they were cooked perfectly !
weird charge on the bill but good experience overall .
would n't want to come back .
i was not happy at all .
such a fitting name .

"easy to miss , driving by !"
i ' m sure he just <UNK> it .
but thank god it was happy hour .
this place is awesome ... .
it ' s tiles which is pretty weird .
we should have done the same .
great food and coffees .
yet another little gem .
lesson learned was this establishment is cash only .
really cheerful and fun environment .
<UNK> chow mein for the win !
would n't come fix a mistake .
this place definitely takes the cake !
"sure , why not !"
"so i got two t-bones , my favourite ."
i call at 00:00 to ask about a sale .
he felt pressured and chose the <UNK> .
would recommend this place to any of my friends .
everyone is usually really friendly and attentive .
tempe would n't be tempe without this park .
just see my zillion pics for food inspiration .
"ok , i ' ve trashed you enough ."
we were not disappointed .
i highly recommend this vape store .
the salmon is cooked perfectly .
"i ' m so ready for halloween , now !"
"not acceptable , and also extremely unprofessional ."
. i love love it .
"got fresh biscuits while waiting with honey , delish !"
not a show to miss !

not worth the small fortune we paid .
snappy auto spa is always the best experience !

the restaurant was pretty good .
it was over this olive oil and balsamic sauce .
. it ' s a little better .
we wo n't be back !

def 0 stars from us !
it was so flavorful without a topping or sauce .
large windows with a beautiful view of the city .

there are a lot of vegetarian options as well .
per person but you save up to $ 00 .
"loved the food , tried some new things ."

nice fire pit on the patio .

a more expansive flight of wines choice ?
"it ' s a dog , not a lion ."
the bartenders are friendly and introduce themselves to you .
chocolate cake had a weird after taste .
both have a good flavor .
she offers to send up some danishes .
servers are rude and easily annoyed .
the spicy bun no hue soup .
i mean there was so much to eat .
their seasonal dressing was a tangerine vinaigrette .
the vegetable / risotto mixture was blah .
our server was very attentive and very nice .
"when he finally arrived , he did apologize however ."
this man was literally doing nothing at all .
its it right next to the love store .
the cupcake itself was moist & spongy .
meat is usually dry and salty .

i was really wishing it was better !
the tofu was actually really great !
"no problem , there is salt on the table ."

our waitress was amazing .

our favorite was the shumai !
the miso soup is really salty too .
don was at my home within the hour .
completely on the other side of healthy and delicious .

i love the decor and the vibe .
i literally seen everyone but her .
"you decide for yourself , but , i say ."
never again would we go back there .
i ordered the lobster bisque and the lobster salad .
and my salad was just plain soggy and bland .

i would definitely recommend this restaurant .
"yet , they sell cookbooks ."
"quality shampoo , conditioner , and lotion !"
the pad thai and edamame looked pretty unappetizing .
it had great flavor .
a small salad costs $ 0 .
no more standing in line at the grocery store .
it ' s family owned .
"food is great , but inconsistent ."
i really liked this place .
over all it was good .
the frosted flake crust offered a nice crunch .

we complained and our server looked out .
no spices and plain blue cheese dressing .

quality not good nor taste .
not even in my 0000 hours at beauty school !

the service was very slow and not very accommodating .
best free bread ever .

. they have everything !
what a pleasant surprise !
first time at this venue for <UNK> .
beef tataki - small portion .
it peed all over the patio floor .
the total was $ 00.00 .
oh and the customer service is top notch
everyone seemed eager to help .
i hate waiting to eat .
but kenny was awesome !
i was really let down .
service is a bit slow .
the rice is flavorful and fluffy .
my first plate of the aforementioned items was delicious .
to top it all their milkshakes are soooo good !
i savored every single bite .
it makes me salivate just thinking about it !
"instead of seaweed , it was with soy paper ."
see you next time we are in town !
beautiful scenery and breathtaking views .
"also , the price was not bad ."
we ' ll definitely be back !
i ' m blonde so obviously not mine !
so i started out disappointed .
we had such a great experience .
an italian vegetarians dream !
it was my first time trying this place .
guess what ... no one ever came .
they also have a great selection of wine !
bring your appetite and a friend .
"long on the filler , short on the salmon ."
not pleasant at all .
saw it at nyny .
mindy is an amazing person .
glad it ' s so close to home .

you will not be disappointed
i would have gone into a rage .
they are as follows : 0 .
my husband and i go one a week .

well that minute turned into 00 mins .
do n't listen to all of the hype .
i absolutely love this place .
love this pizza - it ' s great .
i hate <UNK> yolks .
do not stay here .
tuesday if you like bone in thursday for boneless .
no apology or anything .
the ambiance and decorating is worth 0 stars .
they listened to me and treated me with respect .
"it ' s pho , not pad thai ."
then switched to the amazing almond martini .
tom yum noodle soup 0 .
it became a mission .
so glad i came across total nutrition !
sides were yummy too .
there is no question this is a fantastic service .
the king suite room was beautiful .
nigiri tasting meal ends with complimentary desert .
too expensive for a burger without fries .
credit cards are n't accepted !
the shower was gross .
our waitress was really nice and delightful .
stop supporting this major rip off place !
they took care of everything for me .
the menu makes me so happy .
good times for family in vegas !
"first time , fabulous ."
a great neighborhood bar !
i can say that the soup is yummy tho .
ca n't wait to come back .
you will love it .
amazingly good chicken strips and phenomenal mac and cheese .
we are still in heaven .
she gives a great massage .
service was great too .
and really tasty too .
they always have specials running as well .
"no , just me ?"
this place is falling apart .
it was more like a left over bar .
i wanted dolsot bibimbap and my bf had bulgogi .
wasted money on this delivery !
it was a great experience .
- the provided hand soap was awful .
the food here was very good !
"however , tonight will be my last order ."
ca n't wait to try the whole menu lol .
we even got a brownie dessert compliments the chef .
i stopped here to charge my phone .
we sat at the bar .
this place helped so much !
it was my first time at a <UNK> .

"quick , friendly and skilled !"
. horrible ... i order food to go .
can i at least get a full spoon please .
favorite lunch chinese place !
we definitely recommend this restaurant .
i would highly recommend their happy hour as well !
we have been here quite a few times .
"you can not self-park , it is <UNK> only ."
this visit did not disappoint .
this place is amazing !
and the waiter knows that .
definitely worth the price we paid for the dinner .
our server ' s name was diane .
"omg , they have food here ?"
perfection in a little fried potato stick .
i so love that .
he is convinced it gave him food poisoning .
they explained the repairs needed with honesty .
"plus , they ' re open 00 hrs !"
"we asked for medium , and it was great ."
the exterminator company they hire is rude & unprofessional .
i even tried a bread other than the naan .
found it randomly when doing a search .
give her a call .
it has never let me down .
we ate not a single bad dish .
first time eating here .
our server was amazing .
"otherwise , good experience ."
sent it all back and blew that taco stand .
staff were great and awesome .
... btw ... <UNK> : - rrb -
thanks for doing what you do !
been meaning to come back for more !
they also do lab work in house .
maybe it is really good ?
i will just warn you .
its awesome at night !
the decor is classy but not too fancy .
prime rib was a lovely mid rare .
you can even feed them .
especially the hotel staff !
it ' s a shoppers haven for finding stuff .
what did we do to offend your <UNK> manner ?
i was not happy with my stay at all .
server was super super nice .
nice salad of lettuce and strips of poultry .
the waiter here is very friendly .
savor them with the cilantro sauce .
volunteered here last year with my boyfriend .
except that we only only their vegetarian pizzas .
the magic coffee is a must !
chef brought strawberries and drop it on the floor .
the place is lovely .
this place is <UNK> !
shame on bill and <UNK> <UNK>
pretty painless but the wait sucked .
the <UNK> were just ok .
no agreement or anything .
by that time we were over the entire experience .
everything tasted fresh and amazing .
"not to mention , the food is delicious ."
"server was friendly , helpful and speedy ."
no talking on phones inside .
when they easily were $ 00 each online !
food is good but the customer service is terrible .
every single dish was a major hit .
"our server , heather , was great !"
this is my new favorite .
the delivery was handled by chris & juan .
the place wasnt that crowded at all .
easy to find and easy to park .
"for breakfast everything is good , i mean it ."
now i am bugged .
boy did things change .
. then continued cutting with it .
we recommend the green thumb and new fashioned .
the dishes are great for lunch portions .
great way to start the day !
"overall , not a great environment either ."
it ' s sweeter and smaller in size .
we also had margaritas .
very tasty and <UNK> flavorful .
tortilla soup with the chips on the side .
"the patio is really nice , weather permitting ."
i was n't expecting much .
he said they were delish and very meaty .
the apps are just ok .
we will not be wasting our money there anymore .
i just loved it !
- lrb - like a punch card .
they also have tasty frozen margaritas .
upon finding some kick ass juice in
this is one of my regular lunch spots .
wo n't be going back ever !
discount really is a-ok by me .
the asada tacos are so good !
not even <UNK> us at all .
warm toasty melty cheesy !
will definitely be back .
lunch specials ca n't be beat .
that ' s still no excuse for being pushy .
okay back to the food .
i love this place .
the food was great !
highly recommend stopping by and picking up a sample !
what a resort fee to eat in a restaurant .
everyone else that was working were helpful and happy .
there was no discernible flavor .
"so , i love the wraps ."
overall a great experience which i would definitely repeat .
horribly expensive for what you get .

the atmosphere was serene .
so i went in and got it .
i love the cracked egg !
i love the nigiri so much .

we both had the california club .
great atmosphere and staff for a relaxing late lunch .
"the venue itself is understated , but very comfortable ."

they did a very large amount of body work .
the perfect cure for the <UNK> hangover .
it looked like black friday x 00 .
it took my money !
"cafe bellagio serves breakfast , brunch , and dinner ."

its fun to try different things .
i want to spend my money there !

we left with food babies in our tummies .
we issued a complaint with the <UNK> and waited .
this subway is one of my fave ' s .

our only complaint us the flimsy plastic knives !
it was super dry .
i recommend the spicy crunch roll .

the bathrooms were very close and clean .
did i mention the club is spacious .
he says they sell quick though .
so my friend <UNK> told me about this salon .
if we do n't work nearby .
they gave me a gift card .
i will never return to this location ` <UNK>
it was the coolest experience ever .
this place is just too cute .
went there for lunch with the girls .

we originally were taking food to go .
definitely recommend this place for any occasion .
"wow , have they stepped it up a notch ."
"it was an amazing event , it always is ."
i ' m going to miss their coffee .
the woman on the phone was kind and helpful .
it was my 0st time .
which means the best of eat n ' park !
i will be back .
perhaps a membership is in our future ... ?
"all in all , the food was fine ."
the pizza was $ 00 for tomatoes and cheese .
i was pretty pleased with my salad .
"the bread was good , but for $ 0 ?"
we were really excited to check it out .
or check them out for dinner .
save your breath and money !
the salad was excellent and the dressing was delicious .
the food choices in the terminals is just ok .
we try to make this place a weekly habit .

entree : my bf got the <UNK> scramble .
"- lrb - yeah , right !"
"could have asked though , you big jerks !"

ca n't wait to be back !
<UNK> i have to give 0 stars .
"seriously , do n't even waste your time ."

the staff is great !
they gave us excellent service !
the staff friendly and accommodating .

i had the greek and it was outstanding .
our water glasses were never half full .
"ordered asada tacos and fries , hit the spot !"
love my cat and they did great !
there are definitely better ayce sushi places in town .
even though it ' s small .
and it ' s too salty .
he was kind enough to let me go .
i was n't feeling all that hot .
i was disappointed in the dish .
gran agave has got you covered .

caliente heres a few lessons for you : 0 .
i ' ve also had mediocre thai food .

service was on-point as well .
had to come after hearing so much about it .
both the red and green salsas are incredible .
the chicken <UNK> are amazing !
it was so tasty and had an awesome sauce .
the sides were to die for .
only had a bite of toast all day .
another sadness set in .
live music all day long .

my favorite is the raspberry mango .
"anyway , decent prices and okay food ."
you scottsdale residents who get those coupons use them .
i would definitely come back .
i love this course .
i want to write this very carefully .
do n't forget the salsa !
full of flavor and yet not so heavy .
i ordered a regular latte .
no sense of hygiene .
i am placing another order to take home .
stay at the mgm and eat at craftsteak !
i ' m almost positive they never expire too .
i almost gave them 0 stars for that alone .
"however , you have to try their drinks !"
nicole performed her duties with grace and ease .
i tasted it and it had no lemon flavor .
i ca n't get enough of their chocolate cheesecake .
. they have wed night as like club night .
"regardless , i like bread ."
this is definitely a great treat !
i thought that was kind of odd .
club a great workout !
i had the lobster ravioli - just okay .
the steak was really fatty .
i do n't think so .
camera in hand we set off .
bad business all around !
not too sweet like other places .
just what the doctor ordered !
definitely will not eat here again .
"however , our bags were not in the room ."
everything just plain gorgeous .
sushi is very fresh !
he was almost done when i got my meal .
"endless sodas , tea , etc . ."

i thought he was kidding .
"fun tropical atmosphere , however ."
that was lots of fun .
the cheese burger with sauteed mushrooms was okay .
i would not order them again .
friendly staff and nice range booths .
we had a great time .
can also say it will probably be my last .
started pouring rain ... .
delicious burgers wish we had on the east coast .
so the deal is i have a <UNK> cat .
after that it was a nurse practitioner .
maybe if it was cheaper or shorter line
i recommend her to everyone .
i also highly recommend the truffle tater tots .
it was a bit soggy and meh .
"if i could leave negative stars , i would ."
other reviewers have mentioned the lovely patio .
this place makes me so happy .
"i had fried calamari , which was decent ."
i got a blank stare .
i love this place !
he never gives complements but did here .
my first bite was cold .
gorgeous collection of <UNK> pottery and <UNK> dolls .
he is slow and rude and <UNK> loud .
the large is such a deal .

what a pleasant surprise .
- lrb - which was delicious by the way .
great group go to !
that ' s what i ' m talking about !
the service here was awesome .
she made us all laugh .
they were pretty good .
"whatever , i just wanted froyo for dinner ."

our <UNK> room was better than expected !
i wish they would close this place !
"houston , we have mango ."
last night was the last straw .
this class takes pilates to a whole other level !
i ordered an e0 .
the atmosphere is n't very comfortable .
i loved the asian slaw !
this was a perfect solution and was greatly appreciated .
"now , i was stuffed after my cheese indulgence ."
yikes that ' s vegas for you .

not the best way to start .
i recommend the cashew chicken & shrimp low mien .

ca n't wait to go back .
the food was also very good !
the food is yummy .
i love the results .

fun and informative way to kill an afternoon .
there is no choice in seating .
next came the grilled tiger shrimp mango salad .
i ordered a soda and it was a can .
i love coming here on the weekend !
"however , the food is delicious !"
complete waste of money .
we also ordered the banana bread pudding ... .
we always get a stone crab appetizer .
had a great time at both clubs .
i always recommend this place to my friends .
and it was cheap .
"well , it was <UNK> ."
this drink did nothing .
a lovely store run by lovely people .
"chocolates , pastries and ice cream oh my !"
i did n't like this place much .
they were called <UNK> .
"i love , love , love this place !"
i just wish they baked it longer .
prices are more than reasonable .
would definitely recommend this place to everyone .
lamb was a little dry and tart .
i told him to get help .
i also liked the ambiance and music .
there is just no personality on the outside .
melt cheese + dipped bread = yummy .
they were over fried and therefore hollow inside .
i would definitely like to try it again !
delivery is always fast and friendly .
this was the worse service i have ever received .
"the burger was fine , but not mind-blowing ."
"it ' s quaint , friendly , and delicious ."
i could n't believe it .
they are very reliable and honest .
could n't finish it .
. with too much amaretto in the chocolate .
the absolute best steak i have ever had !
"' ' ` ` no , how is it ?"
how horrible this place is !
took my two little dogs in for a wash .
delightful happy hour specials .
no complaints for that .
went to this batting cage with a few friends .
the hotel staff were undeniably professional and very helpful .
we enjoyed his company and hospitality .

also their bread rolls and butter are really good .
<UNK> would say <UNK> .
"our waiter was kind , knowledgeable and helpful ."
it was a very <UNK> color .
i will definitely come here again !
what a terrific experience for a really crappy situation .
perfect for : - dinner with mom .
he no longer works there though i found out .
it was surprisingly refreshing !
we are locals and we will be back .
friendly and knowledgeable staff !
i wish i knew more people like her .
love the tamales here !
the sushi was americanized and a skip for me .
. & she rolled her eyes and said sorry .
but do expect awesome food !
it was more like 00-00 .
. perfect place for great food and great margaritas ...
i highly recommend this local ' s favorite !
accompanying the pommes was a perfectly seasoned beef rib-eye .
there was n't much customers that time too .
we then ordered the scottish flatbread .
ask for abby and she will do her best !
i ' ve never heard of that before .
i believe the 0th dryer actually worked .
"come on , get go ."
they were thin & salty .
been to <UNK> since the first day .
the tomatoes were beautifully <UNK> and perfectly dressed .
i went around the opening weekend .

the chicken is chewy .
got a groupon deal for two yard stick drinks .
the car is dirty and i ' m sad .
haus murphy ' s is a-ok in my book !
thank you for your honest & <UNK> treatment ! !
my hamburger was hard and so was the bun .
there is also an outside smoking patio .
my boyfriend and i love this place !
cool venue to check out on a weekend morning .
the sides here are okay .
we started with a strawberry martini and a cider .
the fried california rolls are to die for .
why ca n't they get their info straight ?
it would be a win-win situation for us both !
the drink glasses were huge !
i love dick ' s !
there are tons of different architectural designs and concepts .
this past weekend was a great one for me .
my mom had the trout <UNK> .
she has extra toes .
we knew it was time for a change .
- rrb - i loved it .
it had been a year .
turns out my pizza was incorrect .
then we got the pork <UNK> and the gnocchi .
the fries were soggy and gross .
we enjoyed all things pork !
ambiance was louder than i expected .
i ' m a ca girl .

we will never go back here again .
you are the epitome for allergy eyes .
a definite hidden gem .
"and of course , service was wonderful as well ."
i think i could live in this coffee shop .
"it was pricey , but so very worth it ."
i ' m not a sushi person .
went here on saturday night for a party !
the color coordinated doc <UNK> were awesome !
but it ' s not .
make sure you come saturday nights .
she was very helpful & attentive .
i had the tom yum veggie soup .
"he seemed bothered , but he said 00:00 ."
love the buddha spring rolls .
the salad bar was so little .
it came with a side of sauce .
"also , the corn tamales are to die for !"

most tourists are in town on weekends only !
anyway long story short i will never return .
". i dunno , but its waaay 0 salty !"
i ' m curious about their lunch buffet .
i ordered the pulled pork dinner .
great fried zucchini fritters with fun aioli !
i would never return .
pasta my brother-in-law always orders the jambalaya pasta .
not too much fruit to choose .
especially the <UNK> enchiladas !
i will definitely consider staying here again .
i was totally <UNK> out after the meal .
my only complaint was the <UNK> & <UNK> music .
my husband also ordered a glass of champagne .
this place was a little over-hyped for me .
rolls were hard but not in the stale way .
they treated us so good over at whim .
how do i love thee ?
concession stand staff are friendly & quick .
i simply can not though .
my husband did n't mind it as much .
the pipe smoked salmon is absolutely delicious .
"good food , love the hawaiian decor !"
this hotel is great .
my friends staying at paris had the coffee makers .
i gave you another change .
the bread pudding and tempura rolls are highly recommended .
and 0 different kind of hot soup .
someone could get hurt .
bonus points because pink is my favorite color !
maybe i should ' ve ordered a salad instead ?
they will tow your car .
one of my fav ' s .
great gluten-free meal options !
sooooo delicious ca n't even describe in words !
food was average service by our waiter was poor .
tons of classes and equipment .
you can wear just about anything and fit in .
i am not making this up .
the insides were like a little piece of heaven .
went here for restaurant week and was so pleased !
mind you not only our billing was wrong .
it has become a weekly outing !
just okay for me .
"very clever , caesars ."
we also grabbed some pastries .
but luckily for me .
the staff is awesome and the food is great .
we will be back !
i love this place .
i had to have them all .
for some reason that always makes me feel better .
- rrb - and sorbet were delivered .
the salad was crisp .
you get the music ... but the showmanship ... .
perfect in the cold weather .
the waitress was pretty good .
your experience will be like this !
i thought we were going to body english !
and that was good .
we had tickets to a show at 0p m .
large selection of yummiest to choose from .
service good and very prompt .
they are really cheap and quite delicious .
we both loved the salads we got as well .
please learn from our mistake .
i ca n't wait to go back .
the meatballs melt in your mouth .
it came out great .
"of course , it ' s overpriced , too ."
loved the whimsical feel of the restaurant and menu .
the bread and salad that are great though .
this did n't happen this week .
overall though not too shabby .
she poured it out of a plastic bottle !
but we still like vietnamese food .
it ' s pretty neat .
an awful experience to say the least !
just be aware they do get a long line .
the store was incredibly empty .
doctors and nurses were rude and inconsiderate completely insensitive .
they were right on time with my appointment .
mario got the beef stew dinner .
i said okay and looked around the store .
"i talked to clay , the manager ?"
their red snapper is my fav .
service was so so .
the foot massage itself was good .
grocery shopping has never been so delightful .
i was so disappointed .
they are still the awkward little low tubs .
excellent staff and service .
but they would n't particularly like it .
oh ... she only takes cash .
they were both very delicious .
made it hard for them to do their work .
go to milos now !
i visited this restaurant for the first time yesterday .
i like the area and the people here .
i was just expecting a little more <UNK> .
we then asked another bartender for our check .
i will be ordering those again !
otherwise the food is great !
it was pretty sweet .
also ordered brown rice but it was really greasy .
"large , comfy , recliners ."
we shared everything family style anyway .
jason and his team really helped accommodate our needs .
she brought our food and brought our check .
she is also great !
i thought this hotel was okay .
out of this world .
had a brownie that was very rich and delicious .
i would come back again and again .
it does get busy .
definitely made me sweat .
i will keep going on my lunch breaks !
just do n't order any food .
the staff is <UNK> friendly .
i will be back .
"the ham was unedible , rubbery and gross ."
and the photographer on site .
they work with my budget and i have options !
definitely try the carne asada and shrimp pupusas .
it ' s fairly loud so light <UNK> beware !
it ' s like a blackberry moscow mule .
"trust me , it ' s awesome ."
. i could n't stop eating !
and the potato salad is amazing .
and did jonathan <UNK> ever blow me away !
it was 00:00 pm .
i paid in full .
"so good , lots of flavor ."
picked up dinner here on the way home .
thank you for the great service .
i highly recommend harris dental .
"hard working , efficient team for sure !"
skimpy on the electrical outlets .
great flavors and great service ! ! 0 stars !
they literally have everything from sushi to prime rib .
this place knows farm to table and lives it .
food was amazing and very memorable .
they do get busy so be early .
"feeling upset , we left ."
are you kidding me ?
i liked them and they were different from everyones .
friends enjoyed the pesto mashed potatoes .
it ' s a lovely little area .
my favorite part of that was the marinara .
i sprayed the sh * t outta that room .
it is constantly packed and for good reason .
this was the last straw .
note to the manager : hire more staff !
this was also delicious !
we split a paradise club .
atomic solar screens is amazing !
looked 00 years too late .
i guess i just expected something better .
the pancakes did not taste like they were homemade .
i am eating my words .
however was expecting more french items .
a must if you are a vegetarian or vegan !
the spicy mojave dog was pretty awesome .
all food travels well to-go .
i have a problem .
love the decor and ambience .
they did not lie .
i popped in for a quick and early supper .
i highly recommend this place !
their ruben sandwich is sooooooo good !
all in all ... i will return .
it ' s your standard old navy .
for the price everyone was really please .
"again , we did not ask for him ."
"but , back to being hungry ."
could n't even drink half of it .
the staff is friendly and the drinks are delicious .
the burger was good .
- rrb - a $ 000 card .
we enjoyed our first experience .
need to next time .
she was hardly there .
would come back here again in a heartbeat !
he did n't say anything !
great food and customer service !
some other white receipt .
"great food , great service , cool atmosphere !"
i dropped my husband off and headed out .
i love this place but i hate the prices .
i was so frustrated with their key system .
huge pieces of lobster and fresh crab meat !
cute place with a friendly vibe !
the shrimp was fresh so all is good .
nice neighbors and a great location !
i could have eaten plenty more of those .
the rate was very economical .
i was happy they gave the extra effort .
we will definitely use them again !
. i got the perfect poached egg .
had some signature drinks which were delicious .
all of the decor changes from room to room .
i ' m taking off a star .
now i know why .
trendy and super cute .
for my actual meal i had a brisket sandwich .
"therefore , pita pit is a-ok in my book ."
i could not believe it !
overall the visit was disappointing !
kid requested earns <UNK> five stars for sure !
do not eat there food !
. it ' s such a horrible experience .
this restaurant is excellent for a romantic date night !
till next time i get to vegas !
three times we ' ve had to request maintenance .
i had a fish taco and a shrimp tostada .
the salad ... kind of pathetic .
i ' d definitely order from here again .
he was friendly and attentive .
how have i not seen this place before !
"no , no no !"
even checking in was delightful .
they have a pretty extensive polynesian inspired menu .
our server was very pleasant and helpful .
the food was horrible .
it is totally worth your time .
the staff was very nice and helpful .
we went to thirteen north today .
my favorite is the steak served for two .
"the chicken is very , very impressive ."
i loved everything about this place .
you do have the option of purchasing the video .
just had a savory crepe !
we ' d still like another order .
so easy to navigate .
my friends and i ate both hibachi and sushi .
the showers got super hot .
i am not coming back .
do n't go here .
the food is definitely good .
i hate the gym !
great flavors but ... soooo extremely spicy / hot !
- service is friendly and helpful .
"the office ladies were professional , accomodating and thorough ."
our dream come true !
fresh food in a fun atmosphere .
for me i will not return to this restaurant .
we agreed to split whatever entrees we ordered .
this company definitely has a unique culture .
the rosemary potatoes make up for the <UNK> though .
got double beds and they were super tiny .
because all these extra calories need to go somewhere !
i have visited this restaurant twice .
food was delicious and well worth the wait .
the owner was very welcoming .
there was also an on-line auction this year .
not too much and not too little sauce .
' i am very happy to find this place .
where can i pick ?
"also , the staff was super friendly ."
"and finally , i enjoy scrumptious food ."
i dream about that duck soup .
i loved the cinnamon bun .
you can also book the <UNK> center for events .
great little casino and nice little restaurants too .
cute concept and dã © cor .
this is your one stop shop .
i would recommend her services to anyone and everyone !
they never cease to amaze me !
the bathroom was ridiculously small and dirty .
i have never dealt with such an unprofessional company .
the nachos seemed unimpressive to me .
the room itself is nice .
what i did not like : 0 .
the best part was the service .
that was the only reason we returned .
the line was literally out the door .
we also ordered a steak which was amazing .
i think they need more adults working there
way too much food for the two of us .
i also received <UNK> for the first time .
overall i really like sauce .
i absolutely love going into this place !
the food was not good to me .
room service is gross .
eagle shoe repair has been great .
"i had the <UNK> with bread , very yummy ."
service was friendly and prompt .
"our server , joe was great !"
which makes no sense because it ' s rice .
the fish tacos were good but tiny .
i really enjoyed myself at this place .
just ai n't a good idea .
now this is what i ' m talking about !
i got more damage back than i brought in .
you are definitely not limited on your choices .
i love this place .
staff is always super friendly too .
"shrimps , crab legs , raw oysters ... yumm ."
you ca n't go wrong with anything at soul .
they keep that place spotless .
we stayed outside for most of the night .
he gave me my paperwork and i left .
"secondly , we had the kimchi fried rice ."
i know this is not authentic asian food .
i love everything about this restaurant .
we really like the decor and the casino .
my husband loves the smokehouse burger .
she was cool about it .
0 weeks for pastries ?
fun place to just hang out .
great selection of wines .
we both got a buzz off of them .
it was very watery and barely tasted of tomato .
awesome people and the owner super friendly .
dont go to this hospital ever .
bathroom is clean and modern .
this place is a must when in downtown !
the fish and turtle pond is so neat .
"cute , hip atmosphere ."
"overall , i would stay here again ."
go eat in good health !
i love desserts and they have some interesting ones .
we signed it thinking that was it .
i crash it into a wine rack .
asked me several times if everything was ok .
apple store ya just do n't impress me ... .
"great wines , too ."
"quick , efficient service , lots of options ."
let me explain that .
the chefs were awesome and entertaining .
the burgers are always cooked perfectly and served hot .
and the friend okra ?
"they were slammed , and i understand that ."
he was there already when i arrived sunday .
i will never go to this place again .
there is no signage and nothing in the store .
different textures and different taste <UNK> .
it was loaded with mushrooms .
my husband ' s machaca was pretty good though .
our room was very outdated .
"it ' s modern , sleek and clean ."
burgers are super good too .
the lines are just beginning .
"always friendly , always a good vibe ."
our server was nice but things were painfully slow .
. see you never harrahs !
it was a fast and easy process !
trust me you ' ll be glad you did .
we left in a couple hours .
i really like the combination .
dr . <UNK> and his staff are outstanding !
friendly and remembers my drink & name .
the street parking meters are only for one hour .
not to mention my buying experience was a 00 !
comes with delicious mashed potatoes and fresh grilled veggies .
authentic cantonese food with fast and friendly service .
make sure you order the <UNK> though .
i tried it and it did !
she was very professional and very personable .
. seasonal and fresh from local farms .
this place has the best cakes ever !
i ' d be back anytime .
"ummm , no not yet ."
we ' ll definitely be back !
do n't get me wrong .
but totally worth overlooking for this food .
they also mixed different flavors together .
the build your own meal is awesome !
would i stay here ... yes for sure .
i will not be returning .
our second time trying this place .
the pizza was n't anything impressive either .
i will go back !
that ' s pretty great for two people .
still need to try those !
and i am glad i tried it .
so my boyfriend helped me do this .
i do n't even need to order anymore .
i was in heaven .
the last time was just as bad .
the dynamic pampering soap .
you really have to check it out .
must try if you are in the area !
"yeah , not ` wonderful ' ."
the next two tacos were burnt .
worst receptionist of my life .
i ended up buying two orders !
all portions - super plentiful .
"before you grab your seat , grab silverware ."
they are keeping it real here .
we waited 00 minutes for glasses of water .
i blame it on the mules !
maximum comics is a large store and brightly lit .
love each and every one .
they stated that they are looking for the code .
he did n't try to upsale us !
i ' m so glad i stopped here !
i highly suggest the morning after burger !
00 minutes is ridiculous .
i come here every year .
but then we tried to go to bed .
the food is always fresh and delicious .
i believe the closest subway stop is <UNK> .
i was really happy with this place !
keno while you eat ?
i like how it serves so much local beer .
it was interesting but definitely not impressive .
the salmon salad was delish !
i recommend the white sangria !
boarding : i ' m a little unsure about .
look forward to coming back again .
i was extremely offended .
i wan na see them all !
but they still took us .
great vibe and yummy drinks .
everyone was nice and the food was great .
the atmosphere completely <UNK> you .
they make their noodles every morning !
ps the waitresses are cute : - rrb -
yes i said poured .
"i will never , ever return to this store ."
i had the oscar benny which was incredible .
my kind of place .
they just tasted like milk and melted really fast .
my favorite chinese restaurant !
stay here often for business .
seems we can only get service unless we call .
i keep my fingers crossed .
we will definitely be back !
ordered tres leches cheese cake which was yummy .
i am so happy we found this place .
the waitress was helpful and extremely friendly .
i would love to come back here .
"the service was great , which i always appreciate ."
all around bad experience at this place !
we were both satisfied by the time we left .
definitely worth the money ! ! !
"the lobster was huge , but holy crap !"
we stayed a bit longer without ordering more drinks .
there is no doubt we are return customers .
our server was great - very attentive .
do yourself a favor and call him !
"unfortunately , the food is n't great ."
i will be back .
this is a very interactive museum .
phoenix is lucky to have such a phenomenal restaurant .
we will certainly be returning !
i had the moussaka - it was very tasty !
lots of board games too !
never ever coming back .
my third friend came a few minutes later .
i am having a breakfast sandwich on a croissant .
waiter was very attentive !
it was closed for awhile .
she was happily <UNK> away on the sample nook .
we ordered a scoop of ice cream for dessert .
it ' s always a great experience .
we love hawthorne ' s !
sometimes i stop in to grab a smoothie .
"the antipasto salad , omg that was soo delish !"
try it & let me know what you think !
no wait and excellent service .
"as for the rooms , they are amazing !"
everything is falling apart .
and the food was delicious from start to finish .
your customer service was impeccable .
. just showing a little age .
have n't heard from him .
i wo n't go back .
"wow , i have really been missing out ."
"really strong , just the way i like it ."
i order the nutella latte with soy .
it is so ironic !
so i tasted it and it was uncooked .
also ordered the mac n cheese hamburger bites .
"otherwise , i highly recommend spotted donkey !"
put your walking shoes on !
this one is just amazing .
yay for nathan ' s everywhere in vegas .
everything is on point !
he then incorporated our history into our ceremony .
will go back again .
' ' paige was our server .
"simple elegance , attention to detail ... ."
i would avoid this if you are craving greek .
i ' ll get the chicken next time .
so instead we got cheesy garlic bread .
i highly recommend you avoid using this location .
. it was my first time .
they addressed my emergency quickly and i appreciate it !
he enjoyed his but mine were way too saucy .
the chicken is pretty darn tasty too !
we wo n't tell him .
i could n't get in the shower fast enough .
the wait staff was ok .
you will thank me later !
and it is delicious .
and got really excited when i saw the reviews .
it was n't bad just nothing to rave about .
it was absolutely delicious .
they are always so accommodating and helpful .
it reminds me of <UNK> but cheaper .
we ordered the gyoza and takoyaki .
that ' s all i have to say .
the <UNK> al pastor are the best !
it has such a warm feel with great entertainment .
"nice dark , romantic atmosphere ."
first time the service was lacking .
the main manager is rude aswell when i complained !
i guess i was hoping for more unique flavors .
"unfortunately , the tortellini was so salty ."
i will never go back and will discourage others .
the vegetarian mini tacos are to live for !
the door was locked but there were employees inside .
the dressing was ` ` ok ' ' .
we knew it was removed just not that removed .
a complete waste of money and ruined my day .
they are so pleasant and a joy to see !
in fact i never stray away from it .
must try next time .
i realize they could n't change what happened .
i have never had a dining experience like this .
monday through friday only .
this could n't have been a bigger disappointment !
the service was very nice .
they are very accommodating and friendly .
"i was very impressed , i must say ."
the room we were shown was beautiful .
the food was great !
maybe because it was a weekend .
best <UNK> in vegas so far !
. owner is a doll and very honest .
i would say julian serrano in a heart bit .
i would highly recommend this place for bowling .
i would definitely recommend .
loved the xmas dã © cor .
"super friendly staff , great food !"
i will definitely bring my kids as well .
"still , it ' s delicious and good quality ."
the normal order is $ 00.00 .
i was blown away by the office .
it fell right off the bone .
"' ' somebody who understands , yay !"
amazing customer service and loved their selection !
it gave the soup a nice kick .
i suggest using them .
both were out of this world .
add a beer or a salad for extra yum !
it is literally a hole in the wall !
"- rrb - , and very attentive ."
we ' ve never had bad service .
- lrb - see how flexible i am ?
the food has been consistently delicious at all three .
will go back again and again ! ! !
they now serve beer too which is pretty cool .
try the mushroom tart and the mac & cheese .
i finished the entire thing and still wanted more .
i liked this place .
i ' m surprised at the good reviews .
we had the homemade spaghetti with prosciutto .
basically ... i was hooked from the get go !
it was an overall terrible experience .
service on the other hand not so much .
"really , really wanted to like this place ."
this review has nothing to do with the food .
so they happily moved us .
i ended up contacting the veterans <UNK> .
color turned out perfect .
"the doctors , nurses and therapists are great ."
hubby would have given it a 0 stars !
i had the pad see ew .
so we ordered drinks and food .
as a side dish we had the mushroom <UNK> ?
i was very disappointed with my service .
i had a quick delivery .
staff was very <UNK> .
they also sold some maple coffee .
and so should you !
new favorite buffet in vegas !
wine list was amazing .
i highly recommend it !
i order the # 00 <UNK> chicken .
food is <UNK> green beans were the best .
definitely a great deal .
i have to say all <UNK> looked amazing .
the food came out in just a few minutes .
"background music is top 00 , mainstream music ."
"she is such a fun , sweet person ."
we are going again this week .
i was in too much bliss .
they do all their <UNK> there .
it is so uber adorable !
long waits and lack of attentiveness .
gamble and come here to recover .
probably a bit overrated .
the pools were really fun .
also love the creamed corn .
this place is amazing !
boneless <UNK> chicken breast for $ 0.00 / lb .
the decor is very glamorous and trendy .
oh so refreshing on a hot vegas day .
. not so much .
she was very knowledgeable .
you book a room at live room escape !
$ 0.00 for a bagel and mocha .
does n't get better than that !
"our waitress , sally , was ever so helpful ."
there ' s also a pool !
my new favorite place during a vegas run !
"this was a delicious , creamy main course ."
. i will now get to the review !
"to do otherwise would be silly , kids ."
i was very impressed .
round two will <UNK> asap .
absolutely my favorite place to stay in vegas .
the homemade sea salt chips are tasty !
we did n't look at the dessert menu .
we pulled out bones / shells in every bite .
it ' s good for what <UNK> ya !
this place is casual and has a good vibe .
jalisco cantina has certainly become our mexican food favorite .
the ambiance is fabulous .
i can not recommend them enough .
i will never set foot in that store again .
fantastic flavors to share .
do n't order from here !
the best brisket i have ever had !
it was so garlicky and amazing .
i am officially and addict .
i love the nosh !
- rrb - and lemonades - lrb - sugar !
staff are always around but not bothersome .
"i thought , what happened ?"
"but here , i get 0 ."
i loved the car personally .
their pasta dishes and tiramisu are great !
the service was horrible .
all i can say is try it all !
we can definitely sing along .
and i do n't regret it for a minute .
i think my <UNK> explained it the best ... .
i ' m always in and out very quickly .
definitely go to dr . o !
we stayed in the central tower .
"i mean , come on !"
the food is too salty for me .
poor baby was probably sick .
and now the sides .
"so far , so good ."
two things - 0 .
starbucks coffee even better than them !
loved the vinegar dressing on that salad .
i love their caesar salad with salmon pieces added .
i ' m a cirque du soleil fan .
second appointment : october 0th @user 0 .
the food is okay .
bathrooms were clean and service was good .
same thing with their white peach hibiscus margarita .
this show was hilarious !
the atmosphere was casual not too noisy .
do not waste your time or money here .
the pizza itself was amazing .
not sure how they are managing to stay open .
just do n't even question these items and indulge .
i love relaxing on the patio .
so happy they deliver to our home !
i wo n't be coming back .
lash it up is the real deal !
you can easily spend a few hours here .
highly recommended ice cream !
the portion is just right .
"and yes , this place offers food !"
especially if we can have hunter as our waiter .
oh my best tacos al pastor .
"yes , they are plumbers ."
- rrb - they need to clean !
"service is quick , too !"
love getting pampered by her !
it is totally hit or miss .
i love the buffet they have .
"it ' s a clean space , nice tables ."
we left feeling very happy .
our food was mediocre at best .
cant wait to return !
this is truly authentic food .
when we arrived at the shop .
"the potatoes and vegetables were still good , though ."
the banana cake was very good and moist .
"super moist , and the <UNK> were perfect too ."
"awesome , that was a ."
just purchased my wedding bands from here .
burrata pesto pizza = gross .
looks like the tomatoes are from italy .
expect it to be packed anytime after 0:00 .
does n't make any sense .
so will i be back ?
soooo many cute doggies at the pound too !
she was really sweet but seemed new .
why get so excited about bras ?
went today and its been closed by <UNK> .
i love it here .
literally one $ 00 crabcake .
it ' s that good !
"wow , wow wow !"
so be aware of your bill !
been there and done that .
did i mention the room was freezing cold ?
ricky really made the party .
i ca n't stop thinking about it .
so there you have it .
i will never stay here again .
the food was just what i wanted .
such a cute lil spot .
great food and portions !
it is the best .
"it ' s your run-of-the-mill casino , i guess ."
i had the lox and bagels .
our favorite was the creme brulee .
you were allowed one to the pool .
it is a bit pricey for everyday though .
might just stop by on my lunch !
it was wonderfully lightly sweet .
he was definitely on the ball and quick .
their social media department is fabulous !
the hallway was dank .
i had a salad that i almost sent back .
the facility is gorgeous .
chipotle chicken avocado was on the tasteless side .
"but then again , maybe we ' re crazy ."
i <UNK> the service ethic .
saw the dentist that did the job same day .
just not the same .
they have a full bar .
they looked so good !
plus the breading was too thick and hard .
the vegan raspberry sorbet was very beautiful and delicious .
other than hh ... .
we went on a fri afternoon .
the <UNK> and chin was tougher than the rest .
"when i arrived , i was greeted very warmly ."
the chicken pieces i got were tiny .
i wo n't take my fur babies anywhere else !
"it was rather tasty , nothing spectacular though ."
definitely worth the price ! !
it was so juicy and lean .
their customer service all the way around is fabulous !
i always get the vegetarian plate .
"ok , my first tip is sharing is caring !"
my daughter and i ordered sushi on happy hour .
"overall firehouse is delicious , i will be back ."
worst customer service ever .
this one employee redeemed the rest .
fabulous breakfast and great service !
our favorite family dining choice .
glad i packed it to go .
"charming decor , though ."
it felt real crowded inside .
really ca n't say enough about them .
"also , check your receipt before you pay ."
"endless mimosas , hello !"
he knows his stuff and is extremely affordable !
ladies bathroom was disgusting .
cheap and it was generously scooped !
way easier than dealing with parking at the airport .
they have an extensive sake list as well .
glad we tried this at restaurant week prices .
my favorite restaurant in pittsburgh for a reason .
minus a star right there .
quiet location that ' s easily accessible .
tried dinner last night .
the packaging was very functional .
the pistachio was definitely my favorite .
always juicy and cooked to perfection .
pretty good croque monsieur .
will never stay here again .
its amazing how man found god ' s creation .
my key did n't work .
our final restaurant week meal was at alize .
we arrived 00 mins early and sat outside .
best exhibit - the silver cloud room .
` ` how did we get to xs again ?
fun to be with a group .
the food was warm but i was so disappointed .
the food is consistently great quality and super tasty !
i could n't have asked for anything else .
"they arrived golden , piping hot , and delicious ."
bogo entrees ... what a deal eh ?
doors are always opened .
prices are super affordable .
the restaurant itself is decorated really cute .
"once inside , everything we ordered was great !"
to lie directly to my face is <UNK> .
it is one of our go to places .
. so i decided to give it a go .
and above all else - the place was clean !
the room was fabulous though .
"cute , quaint deli / cafe ."
my favorite dishes are the traditional mexican dishes .

i was very disappointed with my meal
quinn quickly diagnosed the problem .
- lrb - yikes ! ! ! haha !
"the <UNK> , pancetta - lrb - crispy !"
the salsa was alright too .
totally not worth it .
"kind of pricey , but is n't it always ?"
"now , we gon na talk about desserts ."
dessert was * shockingly * <UNK> .
even the ketchup is made with real sugar !
tonight i went here for dinner on a date .
now i wish i would have taken a photo .
i absolutely loved their flour tortilla chips .
most of us ordered pasta dishes .

the lamb and mint pasty is also really good .

we found that out the hard way .
"good greek side salad , the beans were good ."
moving to a new city is always stressful .
best transportation service i ' ve ever used !
i like the super friendly servers .
sometimes they are not clear with their own menu .
"yeah , good sushi in scottsdale , arizona !"
not just because it ' s the holidays .
they also do n't mind questions and discussions .
the new ones are pretty horrible .
i will definitely be back !

"cheesecake , gelato and molten chocolate cake ftw !"
i have never had a bad lunch .
"however , the rice is perfectly cooked every time ."
they are amazingly creative .

one zone was just enough and very filling .
they have a cat entrance and a dog entrance .
my hands down favorite was the pistachio lemon !
both made my stomach so happy .
sushi : uni - delicious !
we happened to be there for dinner .
always pleased with the service and quality of food .
we did n't yelp first which we normally do .
much more comfortable & lots of amenities to use .

then there are the treasures that i find .
again - i am a big fan of montelucia .
i trust him 000 % .
my room : amazing .

this place is n't cheap though .
the food is delicious .

"the waitress was very informative , friendly and patient ."
they spelled it <UNK> ... .
"again , only one star because i have to ."
i had had it twice before .
thank you boca park at & t !
i love this place .
your basic skinny fry with a pop .
they did n't taste like or look like it .
so that was a little weird to me .
i ' ll definitely be back .
employees are always rude too .
i will continue to recommend this shop .
i had to ask !
we were seated very politely .
"- rrb - , and whatnot ."
tub had hair in it .
that it was actually a house down the street .
my boyfriend hated the place .
every bite just melts in your mouth .
we orderd rueben sandwiches .
waited in a long line 0 .
it was so buttery and delicious .
knowing someone else went made me finally try it .
i will keep coming back
' ' everyone standing around just stopped and look .
"they ' re into that , not me ."

"again , not a big deal to me ."
so i completely bad <UNK> the pineapple .

i love this pool .
the bed was super comfortable and bouncy !
"on our way out , we met eddie ."
my friend got the grilled meats .
nearly every person we encountered was friendly and welcoming .

not for pets anyway .
"it comes with mushrooms , no rice / starch ."

abysmal service and mediocre food .

"food was small , did not fill me up ."
we ate here for breakfast and had the buffet .
we avoided the dance floor - lrb - packed !
great service and at a great price !
shrimp cocktail is also a great <UNK> late-night snack .
that ' s after they lost my reservation .
i like to refer to it as <UNK> .
finally they get their room .
i would never recommend it to anyone .
good meal with a beautiful atmosphere !
my husband and i will be back !
had dinner there the other night .
love their cocktail sauce !
the room : just gorgeous design .
the food is awful .
longer than our flight .
oh and the hubs enjoyed a warm pretzel .
there was nothing special or amazing about it .
the refried beans were awful .
valet parking is free .
mom and pop store .
the wines by the glass offering was awful .
"they were flavorful , nicely salted and super tasty !"
totally not worth the cost of the food .
relaxing sunday brunch / lunch here .
i love the trade-in credit and discount for <UNK> .
their burritos are legitimately pretty hot and tempting .
i have to check it out on a weekend !
. super salty and not good .
it ' s even worth <UNK> the tequila monster .
the desserts looked better than they tasted .
"caterpillar roll , <UNK> salad , tuna roll ."
amazing ! ! ca n't get enough of frost .
what a great casual place .
"try it , u will love it !"
i want to recreate it at home .
right on the strip !
but the lid was so cool !
that would be a yes .
amazingly beautiful and fun to watch .
"' ' he was great , sit anywhere ."
amy was organized down to the tiniest detail .
"love it , love it , love it !"
"if i remember correctly , i ordered the poboy ."
"you can get half and half , as well ."

the busser was super nice as well !
the red velvet pancakes seemed like the best choice .
all the plants looked great !
the wellness drink is amazing and green !
the music is awesome ! !
for my main i had the hot smoked salmon .
the only other things are restaurants and slot machines .
my masseuse was jason and he was excellent .
"came with the standard basil , sprouts , lime ."
my only option was a gift certificate
but the kicker was the price .
the food was delicious .
but food was ok for a local chinese restaurant .
normally we also add shredded mozzarella and sausage .
"looking around , customers are not happy !"
"whichever , i did n't feel welcomed ."
"oh my , did i mention ?"
there were literally 0 people at the bar .
"also , the pools and spa are on point ."
the one star is for their expresso martini .
it came in about an hour .
it ' s truly a hidden gem !
. okay for me .
i would not recommend this buffet to anyone .
never ever order the half bottled wines .
"horrible service , cold food for the second time ."
<UNK> chips - lrb - cooked in veg .
i ' ll stick to taco bell .
i have a lot of issues with this place .
one word - yum !
. lol lost a lot there .
that was a fun afternoon .
yea ... skip this place .
the only downside was the <UNK> units .
our waiter was great as well .
tacos and shishito combo is my fav !
it was soooo slow !
difficult to get the waitperson ' s attention .
highly recommend this place to everyone out there .
"however , it was fun to practice ."
the lemon crema really made it special .
<UNK> wait a minute .
the bed was comfortable .

we ordered two of these !
the spaghetti is zucchini strips with yummy sauce .
the grits and duck was my fave .
yes they saw me standing their !
the lifeguards there need .
hard to find club is more like it .
i have been very happy with the entire staff .
0yr olds made <UNK> of me .
and not having to drive so far .
katrina had the portobello mushroom burger .
it ' s worth putting up with the rest .
<UNK> ' s was an amazing romantic dinner experience .
they were both well seasoned and delicious .
for a while and i was amazed !
i ordered chips and queso and two margaritas .
i am all about the chicken .
friend recommended this high quality quick service mexican restaurant .
the service was very slow .
the inside is beautiful and comfortable .
first stop on <UNK> nc tour .
maybe i just ordered the wrong thing .
i ask for both raw and cream horseradish .
i always leave relaxed and refreshed .
"i really , really , really do ."
everything we ate was amazing !
you got to try this place for yourselves .
one of the better pho places i have tried .
the two drink minimum .
made us actually feel really uncomfortable .
they loved their meals .
awesome food and friendly wait staff .
my drinks here will always be to-go .
it looked like a brand new audi again !
the lobster tail was perfect !
not one smile the whole time she helped us .
its definately a novelty drink with the dry ice .
"unfortunately , i do n't know his name !"
"do n't think i will come back , ."
i highly recommend dr <UNK> and the practice .
i love this post office .
i highly recommend him and the shop .
the crew was just soo personable .
. i was pretty impressed with their yogurt supply .
i ' d go back to this one again .
00 minutes before we got 0 drinks .
i like a little more crunch in my fry .
worst part was owner never once even apologized .
we did encounter a small problem this visit .
try them if you ever go here !
i ca n't hate .
"each time , they were incredibly accommodating ."
just saying we should not judge everyone the same .
that scared the poop out of me !
it is the nv salad .
so i grabbed a quesadilla .
i will dream about this meal .
just really not worth it .
"and definitely , best happy hour ever !"
the crust actually rises and is airy and soft .
i will definately be visiting cafe rio again .
it did n't feel like a typical buffet .
what ' s not to love ?
daughter # 0 had a blt ... she liked .
everything about <UNK> made me happy .
the <UNK> ticket was $ 00 .

his arm gesture was n't too exact .

they do some of the craziest stunts !
they have wasted my time for the last time .
so so so good !
just remember to sit in the bar .
best doctor i have ever been to .
service with a smile too .
or atleast what i remember of it !
we arrived at 0:00 pm on a tuesday .
"the salad was good , especially the beets ."
i was embarrassed that i brought my friends there !
there is a separate line to get seated faster !
i have found heaven on earth .
my guy had a bowl of the seafood bisque .
"thank you , thank you , thank you !"
this place is in the middle of nowhere !
my boyfriend got the enchilada sampler which was amazing !
"when we left , i felt like family ."
couldnt have asked for anything better !
i asked for it rare and it came medium .
i will drop you off <UNK> style ' ' .
mad i did n't spend more time there !
the greek salad was perfectly seasoned and tasty .
check in and out was super easy .
"in sum , the food was okay ."
it is in desperate need of renovation .

my favorite sandwiches are the tuna and bootlegger .
i was assured that was fine .
my plate was amazing i finished every last bit .
save your money and go to your hotel pool .

the food was absolutely amazing .
i absolutely love the salmon burger !
we did not bother with dessert .

you really have some growing up to do .

high pressure to purchase them .
". not really feeling the long , awkward tables ."

too little too late .
yucky smoking people everywhere .
"thank you , thank you , thank you !"
it ' s full of racist white ppl
"thank you for a fantastic meal , <UNK> !"
beyond disappointed with this location .
how can a tamale be so soft and moist ?
it was reasonably priced and everyone was friendly .
smallish portions but the burger is so good !

high dollar for motel 0 quality .

chicken burritos enchilada style are amazing .
not impressed at all .
the sangria is soooo good too .
"his steak was yummy , too ."
putting this on the <UNK> list !

my husband and i loved this place !
ca n't beat that !
first time ever having vietnamese food .
i love this place !
boy was i wrong !
. at least at bistro .
definitely going to be going back .
i want some right now .
for dinner definitely try the hummus nachos !
salted caramel bread pudding ?
other customers were just staring with mouths open .
"but our server , <UNK> , was great !"
their margarita was fabulous .
everything just seems watered-down and lackluster .
the food was great and delightfully fun to eat .
she was also very friendly !
very attentive and friendly !
i ' ve never had a problem .
recommended for moms and older professional demographic .
"amazing costumes , makeup , and actors ."
. it closed at 0 pm ... 0 pm ?
"yeah , hot day ."
"the potstickers were decent , too ."
will definitely be recommending to my friends and family .
and they did a pretty decent job !
"well , i am so sad ."
the service was impeccable and the food was amazing .
"elegant modern setting , without being at all stuffy ."
"half the computers were broken , props are old ."
that is truly customer service !
after my husband said his piece .
it should just be called chicken with veggies .
thai tea is on point !
i would n't dread coming back !
"another downer , no free wi-fi in the rooms ."
really pretty and neat .
prices have really gone up !
ca n't wait to go back .
today was my last straw .
food and staff is awesome !
i will come back !
both of us had the hot green chili sauce .
i love them so much !
we enjoyed the mediterranean salad .
it was light and very clean tasting .
` ` do you switch back ?
i have always been a fan of <UNK> !
"food is fresh , hot and delicious !"
"- rrb - , and feta ."
you can easily share this dish with someone else .
i highly recommend this place !
haji - baba is great .
they have a lot of antique / retro decorations .
the mojitos from the bar were really good though .
the food was fresh and the restaurant was clean !
the owners were incredibly helpful and friendly .
"nope , they would n't have it ."
hashbrowns were good too .
she literally gets paid to be nice .
- rrb - and grand lux cafe .
i was back here the day it re-opened .
everything was absolutely delicious !
attached full service tanning salon at affordable prices !
this place is awesome !
and wait some more .
i have been coming here for years .
we definitely will go back and take the kids .
the service was awful .
but it is not .
"however , the wait is worth it ."
i recommend the <UNK> vinaigrette for a dressing .
sometimes they even have a wedding cake <UNK> .
it ' s pretty tasty .
nothing extraordinary about them .
the colors were fun and vibrant .
our server was friendly .
my boyfriend got mango habanero .
went their with a group for a birthday party .
eventually we had to satisfy our sweet tooth .
therefore the service was quick and attentive .
"upon first entering , the place is beautiful ."
do not go to this location !
a very simple dish packed with so much punch .
- location and atmosphere are subpar .
and understanding with my crazy schedule and time .
absolutely love this shop .
i enjoyed it very much and would go back .
and that one world is amazing .
it ' s pretty spicy too !
what we got was poorly flavored food and disappointment .
the room was beautiful and clean .
i have but one complaint about the entire experience .
the place itself is okay .
at least ask first ... .
"theirs never disappoints , however ."
i kind of do n't get it .
they do not skimp on the pepperoni !
darn good <UNK> though !
bartenders and wait staff are on it .
the new addition to the works is hofbrauhaus .
i love the shrimp and fish tacos .
they did have a decent amount of vegetarian options !
i prefer <UNK> in mesa or masa in gilbert .
"a place to see , a place to remember ."
i feel so organized today !
pineapple fried rice - yum .
tim was extremely rude and disrespectful to me .
we had a wonderful experience .
i ' m hungry again just writing about it .
no little babies rolling anywhere !
. so bad that we avoided it for years .
i love this restaurant .
there ' s a cute fireplace in the corner .
needless to say we did n't eat it .
nice white spa robes and slippers for 0 .
i went here today for lunch around 0:00 .
the bread selection is fun and warm .
the truffle popcorn was delicious !
we were in heaven for sure .
i am totally ok with paying more for convenience .
they are not cheap with their plates of food .
have been back several times since .
good spacing between seats .
the pancakes are to die for .
must come when you come to las vegas !
"our service was atrocious , so slow ."
". but never again , please ."
"the food is okay , not great ."
i have been recommending it everywhere !
decently priced and fun !
this was not the problem !
this place is literally on the strip .
now their bowls come with the veggies .
probably wo n't be gong back .
"we will be back , ten !"
awesome place and great service !
but the service though .
the booth was huge and cozy .
all delicious but i wish they gave more .
the whole experience was less than savory .
the atmosphere had a good vibe to it .
. he <UNK> us up .
and the entire staff was exceptionally friendly and efficient .
we walked out of there with lots of <UNK> .
well worth it for the croissant .
i bought a half-dozen donuts .
the front desk staff was pleasant .
my cat loves them !
the <UNK> are cleaned after each film gets out .
"other then that , the restaurant exceeded my expectations !"
then ... take a nap !
"then , there ' s the shopping and dining ."
i liked my meal here .
sometimes they give you little samples if the meat .
their salsa bar is authentic .
he was friendly and personable .
called back it went up another 000 dollars !
it was really chill and had a great patio .
i prefer them over the al pastor .
i really liked it .
tiramisu & it was good .
i was pretty disappointed in my mojito .
the caramel appeared to be home made .
i highly recommend hair envy !
went here for my first time today !
expensive but absolutely worth it .
"they also serve brunch , which is great !"
"also , most things are labeled <UNK> in english ."
the service was great .
normally not my thing but it was good .
i enjoyed the food !
this company will definitely receive our business again !
our food was pretty darn awesome .
super refreshing without too much sugar .
' ' or ` ` haha !
ca n't wait for the next venture there !
the burger was very flavorful & tasted fresh .
"the service was great , very friendly ."
"` ` oh , hey !"
i could n't believe she was so rude .
"love this place , the food is great ."
ca n't wait to come back .
my swordfish was great .
. right down to the pickle .
one thing my boyfriend and i found funny .
every time the crust is crispy and never soggy .
i waited for a respond .
are you kidding me !
they got me in on the same day .
he was n't bad at all .
can we say yummy ! ! ! <UNK> !
i enjoyed both very much !
not too sweet and not too decadent .
a better car than when i arrived !
the decor was super cool .
she was probably exhausted .
i would definitely go back again .
we had an amazing time at <UNK> this weekend .
"it was a hunk of doughy , <UNK> bread ."
"because of tom , the manager ."
"for example , entertainment center for $ 0.00 !"
do n't say i did n't warn you .
the service was just okay .
"- rrb - , and their booze is good ."
the family is so welcoming .
i was just ignored and told to wait .
the only downside is the parking lot .
i honestly get cravings for this .
i ca n't get a sitter for that price .
it was garnished with chipped orange slices .
why is that our job ?
went here with friends for dinner on a weekday .
"oh , speaking of which ."
she did n't want to move .
the tomatoes were sweet cherry tomatoes .
they are also dog friendly .
even the plain green salad had an amazing vinaigrette .
my favorite section was the seafood section .
we walked in here and got bar seats .
the 0th street was delicious with my meal .
so they totally satisfied our cleaning requirements .
i also like the baklava for desert !
and i enjoyed every bite .
wendy is amazing and very friendly !
i had the brass mule .
"and yes , you get free samples ."
the beverages area always good and refreshing .
got to sit outside ons sunny day .
great wine and service .
the <UNK> part was disappointing .
huge variety of herbs and roots .
the whole end of that night was super <UNK> .
my favorite is the mushroom and swiss burger !
it really reminds me of small theaters london !
i always come here when i visit vegas .
we needed a plumber pronto in our kitchen .
everything was so good !
we did tasting menu with the wine pairings .
atleast it ' s unlimited !
now for the kicker .
i will for sure go back !
i ' d definitely go back .
they were bigger than my head !
the only problem is : they rarely have it !
they greet you with towel and water .
spent super bowl sunday here .
we will definitely come back .
maria j . did a great job .
the best part was the creme brulee !
they were plated nicely .
i do n't eat bread except for special occasions .
very straight forward & very fresh .
they also change out their exhibits quite frequently .
the sample service is so slow .
so i picked this place to change his mind .
another 00 minutes to get a menu .
had a great dinner here !
looking for a great date night ?
i do n't know .
"super nice , very patient and helpful ."
will be going back .
we let the food runner know of the mistake .
where do i even begin ?
do not waste your money .
the bartenders were very attentive and super nice .
a must-go for locals and visitors alike .
a spot to check out .

my husband and i have been coming for years .
i ca n't wait to go back .
"anyways , lee ' s is awesome ."
this family-owned spot hit it .

i loved the bathroom !
it is worth it !
we eat here a few times a year .
need to change your cook !
drinks were anywhere from $ 00 to $ 00 .
maybe i just got a bad batch ?
i had the burrata salad and it was amazing !
the cupcake itself was a tad bit dry .
just like mom made !
first of all the customer service is horrible .
and both times were the best <UNK> ever .
"nice clean place , friendly staff & good food ."

parking can be really annoying too .
my favourite place for breakfast / brunch .
we were the only ones there .
husband had the chili relleno .
the first thing that struck me was the prices .
the brunch is also delicious especially on sundays !
this made me furious .
using care with confidence was a nightmare .
there is no need for anything flashy .
this place is amazing !
why did i only give them four stars ?
super cute place for slushy drinks .
i could n't get enough .

"nothing more , nothing less ."
i crave the french fries now !

my lentil garbanzo spinach soup was wonderful .
i think 0 are seasonal flavors and 0 <UNK> .

mine just does n't like this place .
i could n't believe it honestly .
cool bar staff and equally cool patrons .
"i promise you , it will be worth it ."
do n't let the construction scare you off !
sangria was very smooth - best i ever had .
classic supper club atmosphere .
never coming back to this store again !
my plate was full of fries so come hungry !

"great service , great food , amazing ambiance ."
it was cooked perfectly !

"trust me , you wont want to share !"
will take our business elsewhere .
i have never been treated this way .
they were 0â 0/0 and 0â 0/0 .
"besides that , nothing else positive to say !"
pita was dry and lacked texture .
but that said mark <UNK> was amazing !
wow i cant believe this sat this long .
we ordered two pastas to share .
also very quick respond !
consumer alert ... rats !
i ' m not impressed .
stars are for food and drinks .
the food was mediocre .
and the carb loading !
our order got screwed up as well .
. which was minimal .
free glaze of course .
my friend immediately felt claustrophobic and wanted to leave .
i would have enjoyed something smaller and less goopy .
this place offers more than chipotle though .
they tasted like cornbread with blueberries .
it was a sad day .
my bathroom experience afterwards was less than desired .
there were 0-0 servers walking around without helping anyone .
the jerks only refunded for the uneaten portions .
sorta like eating vanilla ice cream every damn day .
but not this place !
the parking is <UNK> & convenient .
i would definitely recommend to friends .
cheese crisps and warm dinner rolls .
also try on of their granola bars .
"also , the prices here are great !"
everyone was very friendly .
removing existing carpet / flooring would be extra .
' ' that was totally not what was asked .
it was delicious and <UNK> .
the best thing about <UNK> is their dessert .
you will not be disappointed !
"however , i would not go there after dark ."
ca n't wait to go back !
i do n't normally write reviews .
i will definitely be back .
great for all types of people .
not good today ... not good at all .
after listening we were deeply moved .
it had this unpleasant bite .
this place is so yummy !
get all 0 at the sugar bowl .
this place is amazing !
how is that not possible ?
i like to come her on sundays after church .
many menu choices and the adult milkshakes are amazing !
great place for groups .

the staff was very helpful and friendly .
"the dance floor was great , music even better ."
the resort itself is absolutely gorgeous .
beware because you will get stinky breath .
our waitress had a memory problem too .

he sent ray out at 0:00 that same evening !
we ordered our wedding cake back in 0/ 00/00 .
all the specialty fries are super good as well .
"the show is funny , but really really corny ."
i have always been impressed with their beautiful flowers .
there is so much to learn from a child .
this is very authentic .
the lunch specials are killers !
i brought my daughter in for two cavities yesterday .
prices vary from day to day .
we will be back .
was it hot and freshly made ?
where did the salt and pepper cashews go ?
"so soft and fluffy , yummy , heavenly goodness ."
this is so disappointing to have to write about .
will definitely go back .
- rrb - it can not be beat .
"hence , we had no water ."
enjoy a nice margarita or mimosa with your brunch .
i love the different wine flight options they have .
she never lets us down !
eat here once and you will crave it forever !
i was expecting a small samosa sized thing .
these sandwiches are the best i have ever eaten !
solid 0 stars for the food .
they had a great selection of fish and reptiles .
our bartender <UNK> was attentive and sweet ... .
the food is marketed as being healthy fresh eating .
i will update my review after my 0st month .
skip this entertainment venue ! ! !
all the staff are super friendly .
". <UNK> , gross , gross , gross ."
not open sundays <UNK> ... .
i was excited to finally try it .
but this pharmacy in particular .
woke up the following morning with food <UNK> .
we wo n't be going back .
"overall , a pretty good experience ."
i ' ve yet to have a disappointing tea .
huge new york style slices .
i still was fully charged for my meal !
everything else was <UNK> on this 000 * day .
friendly staff and relaxed atmosphere .
went here last wednesday .
this is making my mouth water .
i thought everyone was really friendly and welcoming .
we were n't impressed with the mozzarella sticks either .
refilling beverages took forever .
i also love how they have bottoms .
it felt so european !
i wo n't be returning .
such mixed emotions about this place .
"sinigang , pancit , <UNK> ... etc . ."
their service is spectacular !
"seriously , how good can a sandwich be ?"
i do n't think so .
friendly and helpful staff too .
i was not disappointed .
the best eggplant ever .
i really like this place for lunch or dinner .
the orange juice is fresh squeezed per cup .
the service also tends to be slow .
very beautiful and relaxing !
"this time , one was all it took ."
brought here by a few drunken friends .
they are so slow .
i would go again .
a hidden gem - literally .
definitely worth looking into for your furry kids !

it looks so pretty out there though .
"come over here , etc . ."
they were both awesome !
"oh my gosh , we scarfed it down !"

whats really incredible about roberts was the price !
that ' s when she gave in .
what was so cool ?
the service was terrific and the food was great .
this place was a huge disappointment .
there seemed to be a good amount on sale .
everyone who works there is incredibly friendly .
but they do have an atm in the building .
you ' ll have fun here no matter what .
perfect to eat on a colder night .
we were greeted very quickly with ' ' <UNK> !
ideal for a good snack i would say !
bigger than the other phoenix locations .
i had a pleasant experience .
they washed it & detailed it inside .
"and holy delicious , was i vastly wrong ."
they do n't take appointments .
it was way too much work for nothing .
"it has apples , mango and kale ."
great place and very friendly !
will never go anywhere else after my experience .
the parking situation is a nightmare .
and stacked on top of a huge watermelon wedge .
there was pushing and shoving then security was called .
went to get my smog check in !
too bad they do n't have wi-fi .
food is fresh and tasty .
i could be wrong .
my favorite bruchetta is ... umm ... .
your job is to serve people not to gaggle .
parking : never had parking problems .
everything was tasty and the ingredients of good quality .
dessert you share really ?
<UNK> is actually good .
would i go here again ?

the extra ingredient did it justice .
it was truly divine .
service in both areas was good .
we came here for my cousin ' s birthday .

"sorry phat , but we wo n't be back ."
great service & great food !
"the atmosphere , staff , and food are wonderful ."

<UNK> was our server and she was absolutely amazing .
the gentleman working was so helpful .
i will miss her and highly recommend her .
the coffee is delicious and plentiful .
i have been here three times so far .

tuna nigiri - it was a joke .
fairly uncomfortable situation to be in .
and they were actually tasty !
i visited pomegranate cafe for lunch with several colleagues .
give me a break !
they check up on you often .
they had a great variety of items .
i really could n't ask for anything more .
no one checked on me .
my one complaint is that there are limited umbrellas .
everything else was just substandard .
i probably could ' ve made it better though .
"again , everything else was very nice ."
this restaurant is small and feels cramped .
i ' d rather pay to go elsewhere .
"four whole squid , yes ... ."
finished off the meal with the oreo bread pudding .
no folding with that slice !
i really liked this show .
my family enjoyed it and they loved the food !
everything seemingly melted in my mouth !

so basically - their service is awesome anytime !
there is always parking nearby the entrances .
kyle ' s pulled pork sandwich was delectable .
these tattoo artists can draw !
they have an extensive menu to choose from .
"literally covered in feces and flies , just nasty ."
"therefore , my <UNK> coordination was <UNK> ."
. real authentic french coffee shop .
best <UNK> for <UNK> food .
and the menu expansion is amazing !
drinks were so slow .
"yes , better than yogurtland ."
the first time i went was my best experience .
i do n't think this is a <UNK> .
i ' m not stopping here again .
so much for that .
he is very rude !

0 on 0 <UNK> is the best !
the decor is trendy and inviting .
i do n't think the food was disgusting .
"overall , the fries were awesome !"

the service is also great !
"wow , i ' m beyond disappointed ."
it ' s always fresh and delicious !
happy birthday to me right ?
we also shared the chicken burrito which was amazing .
decent food is n't too far either .
you do n't have to pay full price !
i would recommend giving them a try .
professionalism / manners are severely lacking .
but you knew that .
everyone is dressed nice .
something has to change .
perfect pressure and perfect amount of lotion and oil .
the service was awful .
all the people i interacted with were friendly .
- rrb - jimmy john ' s rocks !
always loved the owner jessica cuff and her sis .
so has this restaurant ever seen better days ?
was kind of a bummer .
one of the server was so mean .
i freakin met <UNK> ! ! ! <UNK> .
this place is absolutely beautiful .
the staff was very pleasant and attentive .
i liked it that much !
and i mean zero .
or maybe that ' s just me .
the sushi was exceptionally fresh with unique presentation .
all was hot to the table and super tasty .
watery and pretty tasteless .
i waited 0 minutes to get butter .
just not a place i would walk miles for .
the staff just do their jobs .
<UNK> the <UNK> wrap lots of meat !
i suggest using it .
they kept the coffee coming !
they really should have that figured out by now .
i ca n't tell them to hurry up .
my boyfriend ordered coleslaw and the beef brisket sandwich .
i had awesome scottish tour dude all to myself .
i ca n't lie .
i had the cheese burger !

the private dining booth was wonderful .
more great dance routines and some killer songs .
he motions around the bend of the bar .
there ' s nothing special about this donut shop .
overall my food and drink were great .
no words to describe !
the lentil soup was fresh and light .
i would go back based on the dessert alone .
my burrito had hardly anything in it .
the small is really small .
glass and red sangria spill all over my sister .
i received a peanut buster parfait with vanilla .
no sauce at all in my to go bag .
so i definitely recommend the gyro .
best i ' ve ever had .
"basically , we loved this hotel ."
i got their acai smoothie and i loved it !
our hunt is over and tummies satisfied .
all of their cupcakes are yummy !
conveniently located by our hotel palms .
i think we will definitely be back .
there was nothing memorable about having them .
the waitress was super nice and very friendly .
i was bouncing up and down !
we started with the scallops .
this was my second visit here .
"so , i decided to do it this year ."
i love this market !
i only wish there were more !
people that work here are super sweet .
the people in the bakery seem better .
conveniently located in a large shopping center .
i ca n't eat much anyways .
and i can definitely see why !
check out sushi samba .
it was just weird .
they have great food options !
the soup with cheese is the best !
i really liked the <UNK> udon .
"i like my breathing space , you know ?"
which is not easy .
if i could give zero starts i would .
best of luck to this new business !
"accepts credit cards , check and cash ."
i thought the soy milk was really good ... .
truly it was tasty !
extremely poor customer service .
- lrb - shame on me !
love the decor also .
i enjoy quinn ' s on the quieter nights .
terminal 0 is a sprawling terminal .
so perfectly crunchy and delish .
they were out of everything bagels .
came here to celebrate my friends birthday .
my man got an ipa .
the only thing they care is the rent .
"first , the decor is amazing ."
would definitely recommend alex !
what kind of customer service is that .

not even worth a quarter .
i would recommend this shop !
at least for now .
the shrimp was fresh and huge .
i was n't blown away by the choices .
00 % military discount was a pleasant surprise !
i ordered the linguine with white clam sauce .
... but we loved it !
i really wanted to hate this place .
the egg drop soup was also fantastic !
the buttermilk was so good !
"odd , i know ."
so excited to eat here !
i like dishes of different textures .
and boy did it work .
their dessert is also to die for .
let ' s just be real .
the macaroons are packed with coconut .
i went here for brunch and it was fabulous .
we wo n't be back .
so needed on these hot summer days though .
"too big , too many <UNK> ."
"cucumber salad not good , a bit old ."
getting back to the bath .
overall it ' s a great location .
poke was fresh and so yummy !
i was still waiting and then my burger came .
we are <UNK> ordering from them again .
the customer service is decent too .
we had a reservation and were seated promptly .
both ladies had ` ` super ' ' purses .
<UNK> is also awesome .
this is exactly the tour guide you want .
at this point i realize i am being fussy .
and in the end i felt pretty sick .
they have 00 flavors of ice cream .
delicious all you can eat buffet !
a donuts place right next to my house !
the staff was pleasant and the service was prompt .
i love <UNK> pizza .
but the garlic naan and chicken tandoori was yummy .
0 - rrb - they use canned whipped cream .
you ' ll love it !
love the desserts at this place !
the rest of the staff was also extraordinarily friendly !
service was friendly and prices were reasonable .
. yummy chips ... awesome salsa .
will definitely come back .
his fries are too tempting and generously seasoned .
"so , the bad ."
everyone was polite and attentive .
we will be back to try more things .
"well , this is going to hurt ."
the stand out to me was the red velvet .
now looking again for reliable transportation .
i will never return .
the thai tea was also to my liking .
it may be more convenient to get to though !
"i mean , they just do it right ."
server and bartender were really helpfull and friendly .
i loved the choreography .
everything is fresh with wonderful flavor .
it was like ` ` eh ' ' .
the portions are ginormous considering it ' s lunch .

they called this an exam and charges $ 00 .
"<UNK> is beautiful , professional and prompt !"

this was my favorite part of the meal .
she said her favorite was the <UNK> kicker .
moral of the story : gross .
highly recommend this salon to all dog owners !
very friendly staff and amazing food .

but the bartenders - oh the bartenders .
yes i said it .
i love their carne <UNK> - lrb - ?
much better at pita jungle !
"finally , let me comment on the service ."
want to try the paninis .
we also ordered the goat cheese as an appetizer .

i did n't really care though .
how shady and wasteful .
we were stuffed to the brim !

i looove susie ' s .
half as much would have worked .

each to their own .
some of the servers were attentive and good .
"hello , lettuce carry !"
we sampled each other ' s food .
beautiful patio with a fireplace .
i ca n't wait to come back .
i really enjoy this place .
but we do n't have many choices .
everyone was very nice and not overly pushy .
that was just ridiculous .
but totally worth the wait .
it was too good .
"i know , i know ."
everybody loves boots ! ! how can you not ?
it nearly ruined the experience for us .
"beautiful , romantic , classy , all that ."
the pancakes were fluffy .

so sign up now !
it ' s classy with good energy .
"the experience was good , good food and laughs ."
i expect more for my money .
"otherwise , was a great time !"
"artichoke dip was less than desirable , however ."
good thing i was n't a secret shopper .
the <UNK> salad and then baklava all excellent .
"also , it is spicy and tasty ."
you ' re definitely doing something right <UNK> !
there is n't much to say .
the tacos are delicious as well as the margaritas .
never going there again .
"for dessert , we shared profiteroles and chocolate mousse ."
the service was good and employees are friendly .
the service is really good .
this is totally worth the money !

"no big deal , overall i was happy ."
now i was painfully full .
all around wonderful little place .
we loved this burger bar .
- their spinach salad .
but i do n't love them either .
just lots and lots of styrofoam ... !
do you want to eat or not ?
we had a great time here !
pour on some hot sauce for that extra kick !
friendly and quick service .
i would not try them again .
i love this place .

love the music and dancing .
i would n't go back .
the asparagus was good .
it ' s too much of a headache .
we plan to come back .
i could not stop drinking it !

we waited 0 hours for our tacos .
they gave me full portions and a great presentation .
we both got appetizers .
i will be back for more .
she spent more time massaging bone than muscle .
"the stairs though , ladies be warned ."
the best sit down <UNK> breakfast in vegas .
and it ' s open till 0 am .
liked the atmosphere a lot !
they had to refund me and charge correctly .
"burgers had no taste , fries were good ."
i knew i wanted french toast .
doubt the tomato sauce was homemade .
unsure if i would be back for food .
they had sex and now they ca n't walk ?
this place is amazing !
pork sliders and chicken flatbread were very tasty too .
<UNK> the chimichurri sauce is so good .
definitely one of my favorite restaurants .
the decor was beautiful as well .

my husband and i also ordered the tamale platter .
try this on instead .
one of my favorite american restaurants !
"it was packed with meat , onions and peppers ."
i had a simple veggie burrito - scrumptious .
and the tiles were an ugly dull yellow color .
"would choose living here again , with a roommate ."
i spent a day at the <UNK> spa .
the shaded terrasse was wonderful during the heat wave .
so why the 0 stars ?
we ordered a pizza at 0:00 pm .
all i could taste in it was lemon !
i got the salted caramel and the <UNK> chocolate .
they moved but just a few doors down .
the fries were perfect !
but i would definitely come here again !
bagels could ' ve been prepared with more care .
price is okay not very pricey .
"lastly , the peach cobbler was inedible ."
the establishment is very clean and organized .
my recent purchase here led to a new favorite .
i ' ll be back !
i had a pretty terrible experience here .
"as others have said , decent , not amazing ."
they are well versed about wine selections .
the bathrooms were very dark and kind of small .
we came in on sunday .
not horrible but still not good .
"awesome service , great food , beautiful decoration ."
my favorite is signature salad with chicken .
i love coming here for their drinks .
i doubt we will return .
i ' ve never had a bad dish .
i can get a pitcher that provides 0-0 glasses !
there were about 0-0 pieces .
the sides were bad to okay .
our room was not ready .
so i thought ... okay ... first strike .
party of 0 during restaurant week .
"it was dirty , hot and disorganized ."
wished i could ' ve order more food .
overpriced for the quality or flavor you get .
had a muffin and a chai .
this is the latter .
but the communal tables downstairs usually have great service .
. could have ordered more as my meal .
i really really enjoy this place .
"while the music is nice , it is loud ."
do not come to this location !
not what i expected for the price we paid .
service was at par .
my bf usually gets the cashew chicken .
' ' so we finally did .
"the inside was okay , just rows of booths ."
i could n't finish it .
ca n't go wrong here for dinner !
all of that is gone .
the chips have a great flavor .
a nice selection of collars and gifts .
"also comes with chicken , black beans , corn ."
"fresh croissants are delicious , however ."
excellent service and yummy food !
one disappointing moment after another .
way better thai food .
good for the price .
try the peach ale or hefeweizen .
we will definitely be return customers !
but a friend really wanted to try it .
"so , thank you hot n juicy on 0000 ."
it ' s the same with chipotle and qdoba .
what a great experience !
i highly recommend working with casey !
its nice how they have a usps station .
it ' s quite filling .
"literally , the gravy was congealed ."
i was greeted immediately and directed to javier .

the bacon he took his time on eating .
i also chose the horseradish dressing .

but the thing is that is just was n't .
it ' s like tom yum !
each booth carried at least 0-0 wines .
the dessert items are very limited .

this place is horrible and completely over priced .
there ' s a room just for eye exams .
. now for that hostess .

"what a romantic , elegant old-school dinner house ."
you get more than what you pay for .
you can buy tubes i think ?
clean ice rink and clean bathrooms .

i could literally eat their curry sauce everyday .
its spacious & not as crowded as others .
echo canyon is no joking matter .
the food was delicious and plentiful .
no other fiasco encountered after that .

the food is just awful .
"timely , smiley , attentive , and happy !"
ricky is the man !
a vietnamese spot i like better than da vang ?
the quesadilla was definitely big enough for a meal .

"also , the crawfish faces creeped me out ."
would n't go back .
the food was delicious .
we even got a second order to go .

the room was dank .
we sat upstairs on the second floor .
i feel like a vip when i do that .

the cucumber lemonade and pineapple margarita are delicious !
this experience was less than enjoyable .
my husband ' s words ?

he just brings a smile to my face .
"clothing , shoes , <UNK> , <UNK> , purses ."
the coffee is really good here too .

the flavors change often and are always refreshing .
wo n't ever order from them again .
way to go noda !
it was seriously very heavy .

be sure to try a mango <UNK> !
0 stars for the bean burger .
and that ' s where my review ends .

the carribean jerked sea bass was a gastronomic symphony .
go to a place called dim sum .
best pizza in town by far !
he is an expert in his field of expertise .
i ' m obsessed with the <UNK> .
i think you can also get a pitcher .
went here for the first time for sunday brunch .
the credit card machine also takes forever !
people all sitting chatting in a relaxed atmosphere .

totally be prepared for the wait .
- rrb - tends to yell at his staff .
it was probably the mango .
i will have to return to try them .
the roll ups were just plain gross !
it ' s now one of my favorite things .
"' ' yeah , pretty rude and unprofessional ."
there were 00 of us .
then he called me a bitch .

jessie gave me her personal info .
my husband is going there weekly now for lunch .
one word to describe this place : amazing !
that picture definitely caught my eye .
i easily recommend it to anyone !
this dmv is horrible .
definitely one of my upcoming favorite ice cream spots !
just a way to get more money from people .
i love coming here .
again i found this outrageous .
mammoth transportation helped make our vegas wedding extra special .
the pie itself was overcooked and overly sweet .
they were sold out !
it ' s the perfect place for a date .
the waitresses worked well together and were always smiling .
found this gem thanks to grub hub .
the bun tasted a little stale too .
they had a huge selection of fries .
just not a fan on my end .
the most spectacular duck i ever have .
the sales person stayed back around his desk .
i still prefer the frank lloyd wright location .
"looks like shredded beef , it ' s yummy ."
the chapel area was very large and spacious .
i ordered the chicken parm .
service was average but not friendly .
i ordered breakfast basics : eggs and bacon .
we will be back !

the focus is more on the hands and feet .
<UNK> have absolutely no cheese culture .
it was langoustine carpaccio with roasted poppy seed dressing .
i was n't a fan of the veggie rolls .
totally tacky and gross .
the sandwich i had was okay but nothing special .
i am so disappointed in this store !
i ate in the pub one night .

great experience and will definitely use them again !
my husband and i had our weekly date night .
but so be it .

my and my bf shared one order .
the reception itself was fantastic .
my salad of choice is the <UNK> vegan ... .
i will definitely be back again .
i love cantina ' s food .
i love this place !
i want to go back already !
food on the strip can be outrageous !
price : too expensive for what you get .
the ultimate burger ; served with brie and horseradish .
exactly the way i like them !
they have good vegetarian and vegan options as well .
definitely have this place on your radar for subs !
overall i was n't bothered .
$ 0 gets you 0 .
the food was phenomenal .
hmm i would expect them to be more helpful .
truly the best vegan desserts in town .
chairs are comfortable and clean .
customer service is obviously not their strength .
i will never take my car anywhere else !
"genius , just genius ."
it was pretty incredible !
loved the lamb burger !
the book selection for children is fantastic !
this really is a special spot .
salsa not so good .
seemed microwaved and bland .
the prices are great and so is the service .
they really could make it more compact .
i also saw the eggs benedict .
i tried the <UNK> cotta for dessert .
- rrb - and it was delicious .
and they were very professional and welcoming .
the carpet looks great !
"other than that , great pool !"
had the bbq pork sandwich and it was ok .
the signs say they close at 0 .
i ' ve been here twice for the nightclub .
the outside decor was actually really appealing .
we did have the calamari to start .
definitely a regular now .
we stood where they stood .
the spa menu was excellent .
the staff recommended excellent wine pairings .
friendly employees as well .
she was super sweet and very prompt .
they gave me mitch .
they server garlic naan on request which was great !
that is not what we got !
theres two rooms i think .
all we needed was seat and handle bars tightened .
the cider is delicious .
it was good i will return !
my favorite is the grilled chicken tenders .
all of them were incredible .
the crust tasted like shortbread .
just beautiful ; ca n't wait to go back !
stop by and look for amanda ! ! !
i wish we would have discovered this place sooner .
smiling would also be good !
there were no <UNK> on any 0 drinks .
i would eat here everyday if i could !
she never came by .
the beds are terrible .
i bet they have a great happy hour .
we had a round of drinks .
the rest of the night was fine .
too bad they had dried orange juice on them .
this pf changs is a nice one .
the rice especially was not my favorite .
that was a really big deal for me !
cause it ' s vegas !
"large menu , great selections !"
very cute and very tasty .
"the spa is pricey , even for vegas ."
i could n't believe the huge improvement .
i like that they handle a variety of trash .
we started to <UNK> and decided to leave .
we ordered our usual .
i feel like they should be bigger .
"this , however , i had to throw out ."
sushi chef alex is wonderful !
the veggies on the side were beautiful though .
service is really good .
what a fantastic way to start off my fall .
love this breakfast place !
it is so good .
what also stood out was cilantro rice !
that i ' d all i have to say .
service was a bit slow but friendly .
and it ' s for all ages .
it was sooooo good !
there were three of us .
i was done ... .
"it only took 00 min , which was amazing !"
i was not a fan of this one .
not a big fan .
"everything was fine , except for our server !"
i am writing this for / as my husband .
i had my vehicle washed here .
' ' and <UNK> away .
they ' re always so nice and helpful .
every and every visit .
"' ' boys , they really needed ya there !"
i got penne alla vodka with chicken .
but sometimes the services is a little behind
very friendly people who work there .
like cheeses here are very nicely priced !
"in other words , not entertaining ."
all good from here !
"the crust was thin , crispy , and homemade ."
very nice to stay .
best happy hour in vegas .
"the food is fresh , delicious and well priced ."
they were very good !
but not when it comes to wicked spoon .
my brandy alexander was made with ice cream .
what do my fellow yelpers say ?
parking lot was packed !
definitely get it with the wine pairing !
the tent was also serving whipped cream vodka drinks .
the customer service is non-existent .
we enjoyed their food .
romantic white cut out ceiling .
my friend and i shared the plate .
service was very slow .
bonus : the wasabi was fresh .
i would recommend them for any of their services !
it was difficult to break into bite sized pieces .
my boyfriend and i love this restaurant .
quality customer service happening here .
its all about the view .
not too bad of a deal .
they cook the pitas right in front of you .
went to <UNK> yesterday for my new patient certification .
i had the rocket salad it was really good !
also enjoyed the chicken pate .
weekdays are best for avoiding lines .
they ' ll make that for you too .
* cash only * parking is not easy
just do n't do it .
i can not wait to go back .
they came in a swimming fajitas soup .
i would n't recommend this office to anyone ... .
i picked the <UNK> and the spanish rice .
"finally , the food was good ."
those were the winners at our table .
the <UNK> chocolate is nothing to rave about .
the food was delicious and original .
otherwise pack some flats .
their happen hour menu is extensive & very affordable .
best chinese delivery place i have found .
please see my review of this vendor for details .
he was pretty disappointed with his meal .
that way you wo n't have to wait .
fell right off the bone ... literally .
i think the calamari was marinated in lime juice .
service : <UNK> happier servers compared to boiling crab .
owners welcomed us warmly and took pics with us !
i judge you on your bathroom .
does n't sound so fun but it is !
everything else put me to sleep .
the juices are equally delicious !
but definitely a very confusing experience !
everyone loved what they ordered for dinner .
waitress was really nice .
i stressed out over what to wear for nothing !
everything we had was incredibly heavy .
but the truffle mac and cheese !
and it ' s so clean !
dude you work at paradise bakery for a living .
i suggest the chicken schwarma with no pickles .
it was <UNK> delicious .
ants i can handle .
the pool was just cool enough and inviting .
i love their specials they have throughout the week .
what an excellent employee !
enough said i will not be returning .
i had to send it back .
"we could n't finish either , but we tried ."
then today was a nightmare .
the theater / stage was amazing .
drinks were strong and tasted great .
the food was all right .
front desk was friendly and helpful .
thankfully the management team was pretty responsive .
things were super smooth and <UNK> .
". and yes , the burgers are great !"
$ 00.00 for adults .
my favorite part about this hotel is the pool !
i will be back for more !
would def stay here again if visiting .
vegas does weird things to me - rrb - .
i ' m stuffed with happiness .
i won 0 dollars when i first came here !
they came out in <UNK> minuscule portions .
two thumbs up for food !
his suggestions superb ~ !
the tom yum roll delicious !
you must go now .
"however , we are much closer to this place ."
we got a couple rooms .
everything was delicious and in good portion size .
good flavor and the spiciness was just right .
i miss this place just thinking about it .
and my boyfriend got the deluxe burrito .
the food was so good .
we would n't get these again .
it was a nice dinner with good ambiance .
i really like this place .
and the risotto was stellar !
massage was mediocre and service was horrible .
"meh , what a disappointment ."
we ' ll definitely go back again .
definitely something i will have again !
"that ' s pretty good , right ?"
drinks : they make specialty gin cocktails .
the eggs were amazing - eggs a la <UNK> .
i am a very big fan of greek food .
brunch was over priced for what you get .
i could n't have been more disappointed .

what a huge disappointment !
they have great lunch specials too .
"and most importantly , good cheese ."
i never eat at <UNK> .
"super yummy , deep fried pickles ."
"staff was friendly , drinks were good ."
this is the best meal i have ever had .

i am very pleased with this new spot !

i love soju so maybe i ' m biased .
benihana wins on their wonderful hot soup .

the decor is gorgeous and the service was great .
"additionally , they got my order wrong !"

"clean , quick , delicious and well priced ."
i will most certainly be back !

no complaints here whatsoever !
parmesan cheese on top .
i really liked the variety on the drink menu .
- rrb - and the cost was very reasonable .
<UNK> is a hidden gem .
"i will warn you , the beers are strong !"
they are part of the experience .
all very fresh and delicious !
this was our second attempt here .
it is steve wynn after all .
how does this help the customer ?
our server was on top of everything .
we enjoy the food and drinks too !
my chicken skewers were dried out fatty and rubbery .
only one thing to say : terrible customer service !
"otherwise , the salad was fine ."
you need to accommodate people with babies .
this is the only good thing about ti .
we were quite happy with our mere mortal room .
not the best sushi i ' ve had .
absolutely love this new addition to old town scottsdale !
this store is not open to the public !
we so love patron ' s anywhere in pittsburgh .
. neither did the manager .
<UNK> saved my table !
basically everything we ordered was underseasoned .
definitely would go back .
i could n't finish more than half .
"overall , great experience !"
ca n't wait to see another production !
do not use this company .
i will definitely be coming back !
i ca n't stand waiting in lines .
the other flavor i got was fine .
there are only 0 restaurants in this hotel .
they have booths as well as tables .
there really is no service .
i ' m hesitant to go back ... .
they really care about their customers .
people get into it .
maybe they were more busy than i could see .
but i do n't think so .
they lost my photos .
i was very disappointed .
he made the experience super pleasant for us .
even the bagged salad greens are more vibrant .
this thing was huge !
cover charge $ 0 each added to our bill .
we went with another couple for our anniversary .
i told her i did n't mind .
at one point even stopping a cook .
has notes of coconut from the rich cocoa powder .
i am just not impressed by the prices .
we would definitely come back in the future .
the room was really spacious .
i could do shots of that sauce .
"wow , what a huge , fun play park ."
"he engaged , he laughed , he made recommendations ."
i also really like the chicken marsala .
this place is so good !
i agree that the beer menu is amazing !
"pet club , get it together ."
close to the lake and park .
we sat near the outside area .
she was just very off-putting .
we loved this place .
at least the kids food was hot .
now for the good !
bean choices are black or pinto .
comes with a side of fries .
thanks for wasting my time !
i bought the groupon offered earlier this year .
they move rather quickly though .
please pass this on .
i love this place !
then he made me lay on my belly .
they did n't vacuum or wipe anything down .
the service seemed to be a bit insufficient .
what a pleasant surprise !
clearly no one at that club .
i asked if it was a an apple cider .
it really was panoramic .
i had a really good time staying here .
i am in love with this yoga studio .
it was so fresh and delicious !
i definitely would recommend this place to everyone !
those two things they do an amazing job at !
the food was pretty sucky .
our server <UNK> was very nice and attentive .
"in fact , i ' d return again ."
make reservations or be prepared to wait .
and so do my kids !
it was ok for my first year .
the waffles & fries were amazing !
parking garage is $ 00 overnight .
the crazy chicken is correct !
such a cute place in the <UNK> !
the show that we watched was okay .

i dont even know where to start !
ahi summer roll 0 .
` ` i know you ' re there !
it is exactly what i was looking for .
tip : get there early and come hungry !
they gave me a completely new dozen eggs .
it looked really silly and even <UNK> .
the salad they serve with it was super fresh .
the choice of restaurants also did not disappoint .
i also love wynn and encore .
fantastic crew and teamwork ! !
i really wish i liked this place more .
very similar to the regal cinema card .
i had the meatball pizza .
gee <UNK> bob did i leave full !
disappointed and disgusted in their service !
food took a little long to be prepared .
the lady on the phone was very helpful .
we will definitely come back here !
will always go here again and again .
"overall , pretty awful night out ."
last time i was there i tried the fries .
i really enjoyed the potatoes .
i had the fish and it was yummy .
canada uses the at table credit card machines .
and they are right .
they had great quality ingredients .
excellent business services center in the hotel .
staff was very nice and helpful .
i highly recommend them !
that amaretto cake is stuff dreams are made of !
it totally rocked my world !
they were helpful and not at all snobby .
i ' m very disappointed in thai chili management .
i wish i can leave no stars !
but he is not some guys employee !
my first consultation with <UNK> was none reassuring .
however the food at this place was just gross .
he liked it though .
reminiscent in feel of open <UNK> along sienna river .
it definitely hit the spot for sure .
oh and do n't order room service food .
the atmosphere is super chill and bright .
there was no balance of flavors .
i love the romantic vibe this places gives off .
they also offer military discounts .
"lynn was flexible , friendly , trustworthy and knowledgeable ."
- lrb - even doggie yoga class !
popcorn girl - your employees are super !
i also loved the pork cheek .
i wo n't be returning .
alcohol & happy hours .
i am shocked this place has such high reviews .
it ' s too thick for me .
maybe this time will be different .
as well as the fresh-squeezed orange juice .
the mango juice was watered down this time .
customer service was so much better in general .
i enjoyed eating this a lot .
there are way more better restaurants in vegas .
and i had asked for medium rare !
keep your kids busy and your sweet tooth happy !
i love el sol !
ok i ' ll just bring it back .
"wow , what a surprise !"
we got take out on a saturday night .
very cozy little place .
now i know why .
we were very pleasantly surprised by our dinner .
i thought the place was awesome on my consultation .
this is my fav spot !
we managed to eat at <UNK> and seoul sausage .
it was delicious and huge .
. love this little place .
will definitely be back !
ca n't get much better than that !
this restaurant was terrible .
pix of my hair coming soon !
probably would n't return based on the poor service !
tao beach is an exception .
and that meal cost me almost $ 00 !
this is my neighborhood favorite .
an hour later i felt wonderful and relaxed .
i absolutely love this place !
i would get something different next time .
i ended up having <UNK> for almost 0 weeks !
"why : tacos , tacos , and more tacos !"
- prices were very reasonable .
they ' re family owned & operated .
service is not <UNK> !
the steak was perfectly cooked .
the led lights are so cool .
ca n't wait to return for more !
nothing much left since we came in late .
i have to say i was not impressed .
our service staff were very friendly and attentive .
the sweetest young male was our server .
i ' ll definitely be back though .
side order of mac and cheese was delicious .
i love this store .
<UNK> has had quite a few ups and downs .
there is n't a ton to choose from .
i took a few bites and was done .
she had another large group and was clearly rushed .
the margaritas were great .
:d this restaurant is great to go for lunch .
"one downfall , <UNK> allowed ."
guess i should stop eat it forever .
"the <UNK> was edible , too !"
i would go back !
we were looking forward to trying this place out .
i will definitely eat there again .
will b coming back !
unless you dont mind screaming across the table .
so sue me - rrb - .
<UNK> up to them !
perfectly seasoned in a way i had never experienced !
i just wanted to sleep all day .
the bake potato are to die for .
the pools were all closed except one tiny one .
there was a long line .
i highly recommend it .
i will definitely return .
fried chicken is always a favorite .
i <UNK> this was my last visit there .
i absolutely loved it .
it was such a tiny portion for $ 00 .
my sister and i loved the pedicures here .
we will not be back .
i have to give the service mixed reviews .
the service was excellent too !
i have been back several times since .
right away i am put off by the seating .
he was very professional and nice .
i did not even mention that .
the hip staff was very nice though .
- rrb - i suggest stopping by .
"good space , great pool , great party ."
so why only 0 stars ?
this lake is big !
was the service good ?
i know most theatres have that option .
other than that it was perfect !
it was also really great .
i had the chicken tinga empanadas which i loved .
i loved the sweet potatoes too !
i recommend sitting at the bar .
. ana was her name .
"not worth time , money or energy ."
the food was hot and delicious .
do n't sample it !
the rooms are small .
first introduction to their pretzel was absolutely mind blowing .
caesar salad was decent .
they have a a menu with variety .
this is one of my top 0 favorite buffets .
these tortillas held it together and were nicely toasted .
this did not come with a side .
"i might , however , return for daytime brunch ."
it was decently priced and excellent food .
would n't give it to my dogs .
"well , whatever ... this place is really cute ."
"their tacos are puny , expensive and flavorless ."
came to catch up with a friend .
i have mixed feelings about dinette .
i really wanted to love this place .
she even reprimanded me for language .
she made me some amazing boozy tiki concoctions .
would not recommend ever coming here again .
my watermelon martini was delicious although a little pricey .
the only person who did n't finish was me .
lots of compliments at our christmas party !
our instructor was great !
and the sweet potato fries were actually tots .
our first stop on our self created bar crawl .
i would also suggest the garlic knots .
would definitely encourage folks to try this place out
i enjoyed the beans .
"by the way , clowns are creepy !"
i would highly recommend it !
delish ! ! ! phenomenal fries too !
local farms utilized and friendly people !
"our server , melissa , was friendly and helpful ."
"i run this every morning , love it ."
the bathrooms were dirty .
"couple months later , my car overheated ."
it ' s that good .
"the pancakes though , awesome !"
"i will never , ever , go back ."
thumbs up all around !
it was a really amazing dip .
and their coffee drinks are to die for !
everything was really good !
you must try dutch brothers !
our server was courteous and friendly enough .
wanted to leave immediately after i walked in .
this was our first show .
wide selection of snacks .
"yes , you heard me right ."
not worth $ 00 .
"their sweet tots , out of this world !"
boyfriend loved the clothes and they fit well .
the smoked salmon was super delish and very fresh .
we were simply ignored an overlooked .
no balsamic or herbs or salt .
such a great store .
it did not get hot at all .
we ' d return ... for the pastries .
it was my favorite dish because everything was perfect .
the first bite was amazing .
this was a let down .
love the smokey flavors !
i really like these cupcakes .
i always eat everything unless it is inedible .
"goodbye firefly , not sure i will be back ."
we ordered the antipasti plate ... it was perfect !
most hotel rooms do n't even have that .
we are all italians and know good food .
validated garage parking available for your appointment .
no clue the menu is basically burgers and sandwiches .
"it with fries , fish and a drink ."
tables are <UNK> from each other .
this was my first time seeing cirque du soleil .
"loud , dark , excellent service , wonderful food ."
this place should be called heaven on earth .
i would n't come back .
at tacos el gordo we found them indeed !
"really , it was a wonderful dining experience ."
service is always good as well .
"everything we were looking for , and then some ."
the decor is fabulous .
' ' - absolutely delicious entrees .
the sushi gets 0 <UNK> staff is also incredible .
i ' ve waited months for some take out !
food is always fresh and tasty .
our server then disappeared .
great to find another tucked away szechuan restaurant .
brandon and <UNK> are amazing .
staff is always nice and welcoming .
we enjoyed the food and talking to them .
"hands down , i feel twenty years younger ."
she said ... yes it is .
my date had the shrimp caesar .
i went for brunch .
felt like <UNK> all night .
the baba ganoush is my new fave thing !
<UNK> is so good !
good atmosphere sitting outside .

the service was not .
this was followed by a frown .
seriously slacking i always have wonderful and speedy service !
scan your items and see what has secret discounts .
omg the banana cream pie was to die for !
i went on sunday at 0 .
our 0 yo loved it .
he has always been great with my kids too !
i had the asian lettuce cups .
they also have beer and wine available .
this place is truly a gem !
the cafe was packed .
this review is based on poor service .
the pineapples are frozen and shipped from california .
very likely my most favorite hampton inn ever .
one of my favorites .
it ' s so frustrating .
my favorite is the seafood pizza .
so we get our drinks and sit down .
i booked on line .
i shall literally break it down .
free coffee while you wait for your table !
i ' m salivating just thinking about it .
"dry , hard , completely void of flavor ."
"however , the season fries were horrible ."
the usual lunch time treats .
and all of this with a smile .
savor every bite when you go !
i plan on becoming a regular customer .
we just ended up where we needed to be .
do n't remember price .
i ' m here right now .
everything just tasted fresh .
would definitely go back .
a great spot for breakfast or brunch !
i took this to-go and was n't a fan .
the service here was awful .
"it tasted good enough , but ."
it ' s not an inconvenience at all though .
we opted to take our food out .
house chardonnay and chianti were sipped <UNK> .
i had the catfish sandwich with fries .
"also , you never have to wait too long ."
my only issue is the limit on colors .
we ' ll be back .
dunkin donuts turbo ! ! ! .
this was my first time being there .
went here to get mt samsung laptop fixed .
first time today for lunch .
good place to grab a healthy lunch .
got the garlic knots .
"fast , clean and staff is super friendly ."
everyone was very friendly and the room was beautiful .
my sister made a reservation for lunch .
they kept blaming the owner .
would i say it ' s better ?
will i go back ?
i also tried their cheese blintzes with strawberries .
i still love you <UNK> .
the wine list rocks too !
that was about 0-0 months ago .
but our waitress tried to look for some anyway .
it was just alright .
i do n't even know where to start .
"nothing fantastic , but not limited ."
the service is amazing and the staff is friendly .
he asked how we would like the meal timed .
took me less then 00mins for everything .
i had steak and frites and it was delicious .
you can even order pasta and chicken dishes .
frank and chris are great .
. watch out for the mixed hurricane drinks .
"yum , yum , yum"
"very cool , funky , atmosphere ."
but i would definitely drop in here again .
because it is a convenient drive for me .
definitely not worth the $ 00 we paid .
still very very good !
. but this location is my absolute least favorite .
a nice break from the craziness on fremont street !
would any of us go back ?
i will be ordering and visiting regularly !
i loved the ambiance .
"so we slept , woke up and checked out ."
the staff at this location is great !
their iced tea is pretty good too !
the lamb chops were cooked correctly but lacked seasoning .
all of the hummus selections are tasty .
<UNK> there were no flies outside .
"the menu is funny , which is great ."
is it worth checking out ?
it was really good !
there was half crab in the soup .
i will come back here again .
everyone enjoyed their meal .
it ' s soooo yummy !
sprouts is my go-to grocer !
new favorite coffee shop !
not oily and crunchy .
he can make your day .
we both thought the dish was bland .
a + in my book !
they work really hard and their sushi is amazing .
we both really enjoyed this little gem .
nothing to rave about .
the service is hit or miss .
i was using a coupon anyway .
the pizza was just alright in my book .
defiantly will be coming back for sure !
they were a nightmare to deal with .
it is very modern looking .
thank you for holding lost articles !
i really wish there was more kick to it .
i enjoyed everything i ate !
i wish i could eat like this every day !
the one i had was the <UNK> .
wan na impress your coworkers on friday mornings ?
it was packed at 0 pm on a thursday .
it ' s home town yummy !
will the price be right .
that was really disappointing right off the bat .
"overall , its a decent family restaurant ."
i usually just get coffee .
00 out of 00 !
do n't expect to relax here all day long .
"personally , i ca n't wait to go back ."
"plus , the prices are very fair ."
your going to drop me 00 floors ?
so i am not a fan of fast food .
their rolls are so delicious !
our server was very attentive .
"luckily , they had smaller female sizes for me ."
"flavorful , sort of ."
"it is quiet , intimate and has great ambiance ."
i had excellent service .
my husband and i love mastro ' s .
<UNK> helped me out a lot .
i was pleasantly surprised by this place .
we decided to cancel the whole transaction .
all of it was horrible .
it ' s just so pretty .
we went here with another couple and their children .
"yay , something i could eat !"
this location was great .
and i have n't been in a while .
or just spicy in general .
can not wait until my lease is over .
this is just a little bit .
the pasta was cooked perfectly and everything was delicious !
ohso staff = <UNK> !
i have only came here for lunch .
glad i only had two options to try on .
typical continental breakfast with eggs and sausages added .
the place was filling up fast when we left .
so now what to do ?
and i mean entire .
i imagine lunch and dinner are as much fun .
i ' m cool with that !
potato salad and sweet tea both addictive .
expect to wait a few minutes to be seated .
my boyfriend seemed equally pleased with his <UNK> .
visited for a conference so did not stay over .
"the food was really , really good ."
it was so good !
a good discount always makes the experience more enjoyable !
we will absolutely not be back here again .
this place never disappoints .
i really love their seasonal beers !
. love all there pancakes .
just ask them for a map .
service is always very good !
we waited and waited and waited .
brian was our server .
we had a very nice time .
looked like vip had their own dance floor .
baskin robbins is da bomb !
i have a hard time finding good italian .
get to it <UNK> !
your library card is more than a library card .
the cake has always been nice and moist .
they were all moist and delicious .

i recently had the garlic shrimp entree ... .
we ' ll never return .
flavor wise was just okay .
only one pool that ' s always dirty .
service was quick and helpful .
and vintner delivers on both fronts .
the mashed potatoes needs more seasoning too .
their furniture is cheap .
they always tried making conversation .
i then ordered their chicken salad on sourdough bread .

hence why we are here !
everyone is super friendly .
the prices are fabulous .

the bread is seriously the best texture !
we stayed in a suite .
the delux burger is amazing and huge !
we sat at bar and bartender was very pleasant .

save your money ... seriously .
i absolutely crave their greek salad with grilled chicken !
love the concept of swapping clothes : so eco-friendly .
the meal was sooo delicious !

i was <UNK> right there - how refreshing .
every juice i would buy caused me horrible headaches .
"it was pricy , but so worth it ."
my favorite though was all the cats roaming free .
i give this 0 stars !
we were pleasantly surprised .
what can i say ?
that is why the coleslaw is so good .

edamame had way too much salt .
i will definitely be a regular here .
"second , the customer service ."
"not a huge deal , whatever ."
. i have no intentions of returning !

the food was nothing to rave about .
it ' s definitely worth a visit !

the service is ok .
i did not know restaurants had time restrictions .
i have yet to manage to have menudo there .

haha they all sound the same to me .
- rrb - to make a kid happy .
wait ... where was my fruit ?
just got my daughters glasses in just 0 days !

so happy we took a chance and went here .
the service was quick and very friendly .
this was an extra touch i had n't seen .

my biggest disappointment was the bacon wrapped dates .
you wo n't regret eating at stacks & yolks !
my dish was $ 00 .
i gladly hand over the card .
one of my favorite spots in phoenix !
our waiter was slow .
the bun stays together .
the staff knew nothing about <UNK> or ingredients !

the total cost was also reasonable .
"it was good , but different ."
the prices are super cheap .

they came home too with our leftover steaks .

all in a safe and clean environment !
the rest of the food is just so-so .
please turn your phone off and enjoy the show !
my fiancã © loves the cherry bomber .
i like the <UNK> beach with white sand .
they had thrown it out !
<UNK> about painting anything .
it was so light and airy .
the service this last time sucked !

and i ' m not ashamed .
' ' with a very snarky tone .
they are <UNK> but very soft .
it ' s vegas though .
"pizza was bland , pasta was even more so ."
the koobideh was pretty juicy and well seasoned .
do you like vinyl ?
. so we had nothing to drink still .
they also offer a wider range of salon services .
"point is , it was delicious ."
everything was super delicious .
very pricy in my opinion .
. our drool must have touched their hearts .
next time i will have to have a beer !
"none the less , it was good ."
the catfish was perfectly seasoned and crisp .
you got like two entrees for one small price .
also loved the military display in the back .
but the food is worth it !
kind of different but it was fine with me .
good prices and delicious food .
that ' s not easy to pull off !
we will definitely be back .
onion rings were on point .

beth and her team are amazing .
. standing room only at the hostess station !
and try the buffalo chicken dip .
service was friendly and attentive .
one of my favorite mexican places ever .
maybe because we were there on weekdays .
the lady helping us though was nice .
i love that button .
anyway the steak and eggs are definitely worth it .
this place is magical and the food is awesome !
delicious ! ! ! the pizzas are really good !
but the <UNK> pasta in tomato sauce ?
the colors the crystals ... .
i really wanted to like this place .
they do have a good happy hour though .
strawberries and banana dipped in chocolate on a stick .
literally the worst waiter i have ever come across .
next time i ' ll stick with a 0 !
we will definitely be back soon .
and i want to check out their other location !
i could have ordered one of ten different things .
i do n't get it .
"he said the oatmeal , parfait and our wrap ."
do n't tell me !
tried burgr for the first time last night .
came here sunday morning with the boyfriend .
you wo n't be sorry !

fantastic food - favorite is the mussels .
the glazed donuts are perfection .
"it came with 0 tacos , rice and beans ."

"there , i said it ."
i tried the ayce which was $ 00.00 .
and that was it .
i wish i had it all to myself .
we rotated so we could all try a slice .
i do n't know how else to describe it .
oh how i love this place !
very fun to watch !
"amazing service , amazing hookah , amazing drinks ."
it was all on a perfectly toasted ciabatta bread .
this place was great until we tried to pay .
the lady was so rude and bad manners .
"overall , the service was quite disappointed ."
another disappointment - no decaf espresso .
you ca n't beat this !
i love cheese whiz !
our waitress was terrible .
unfortunately my soy sauce could not improve it either .
i was so wrong .
i was surprised at how small the sandwich was .
so worth the drive off the strip .
how awesome is that ! ? 0 .
it ' s not the best .
phoenix needs more places like french grocery !
i love this place !
i had a bacon pear grilled cheese .
the prices are also really reasonable .
told me they were unable to do it .
went off a few times .
. and the down-to-earth cozy atmosphere is refreshing .
it was the perfect blend of sweet and spice .
i ' m glad we did .
it was completely worth the trip !
. i left after the drink .
she is quite rude and not people person .
<UNK> is such a great restaurant !
i have only two complaints : 0 .
what can i say ?
uniformly amazing and a perfect <UNK> brunch .

but today just plain sucked .
i love this place so much .
check the website for more info .
"and of course , tapas !"
i did n't think it was spicy .
"answering your phones would n't hurt , either ."
the cook came out asked if i was ok .
it was refreshing and light .
i would give it no stars if i could .
manhattan clam chowder was n't tasty .
wines by the glass change all the time .
"also , the bathrooms are always <UNK> ."
doors were supposed to open at 0 .
the owner was so welcoming and appreciative .
i love crepes but i also love families .
i ' m surprised it was not more busy !
"whatever it is , i ' m a believer ."
"when my meal arrived , there were fries ."
the <UNK> three words : chicken pot pie !
i loved the burger - it was about perfect .
best to get there early in the am .
the wait at 0pm on a friday was 00mins !
conch was served with this mayo mixture .
"in retrospect , i now find it insulting ."
wait staff also good and friendly .
"clean , but still saw a few bugs ."
the weight staff was friendly and very helpful .
fish was not fresh .
i chose firebirds as my birthday dinner .
had to update my original rating .
not the same restaurant !
it always tastes clean .
i love ian ' s .
we ordered cappuccino and tiramisu .
i came here twice .
"sound delicious , right ?"
$ 0 for a cup of coffee ... .
puppy paradise is super clean and welcoming .
the lamps do not turn on .
it was a huge slice too !
"a bit cold but overall , it was delicious ."
. it smelled divine !
not expected from such a nice hotel .
the atmosphere mirrors an east coast jewish deli .

thankfully this was at the end of our night .
"we were surprised , but pleasantly ."
"it was harsh , double whoops ."
he brought it out .
we love this place .

"the mushrooms were delicious , as was the bacon ."
ca n't wait to go back !
"so , i tried it in las vegas !"
i tried my sister ' s pastrami melt .
"for appetizers , we ordered the shrimp and grits ."
it was perfectly cooked and tasted sweet !
gooey swiss cheese ... that speaks for itself .
so this is my very first time here .

they have something for everyone .
i will come here again with family or friends .
hope they get their shit together .
a miracle for me .

nothing ` ` thai ' ' about my tiramisu .
a friend recommended dr . dexter .
"excellent service , excellent food !"
the band playing was fantastic .
"the bar was pretty , the restaurant was pretty ."
i was pretty excited .
they close at 000 and we arrive at 0:00 .
sat upstairs with the great view .
. it was frozen in the middle .
it ' s inexpensive and filling .
i love everything about this place .
we will return for a dinner again .
the same 0 that tag <UNK> us all night .
its very welcoming to everyone .
i did n't like the pad thai .
"yummy , yummy in my tummy !"
our evening had been almost instantly ruined .
it was a little too salty for me .
boxed frozen is better .
the pricing is a bit too much for me .
get the loyalty card for frequency rewards .
still one of my favorites .
"and , it ' s not <UNK> ."
i can not think of one bad thing .
salad was fresh i had two appetizers .
they really listen and take care of you .

yesterday was especially bad .
and the coffee was so good !
both had no spices or flavor .
but i wanted be back for awhile .
amazing customer service and products smell wonderful .
each game was $ 0.00 each .
but i thought it lacked complexity .
fresh ingredients and bread you could just eat alone .
the hotel itself has so much to do .
this place is great !
that is extremely poor customer service .
"in addition , the turkey was processed meat ."
definitely will be coming back for more soon .
$ 00 + with tip for 0 people .

looking forward to trying other things on the menu .
the front desk people were very friendly .
good atmosphere but food is just okay .
that ' s a huge plus !

the beet salad is extraordinary .
everyone said their meal was delicious .
huge portions ! ! and tasty too !
now i ordered the 0 chicken breasts and waffle .
it ' s so awesome inside !
it was n't sweet which i liked .
our waiter was fantastic .
she actually rolled her eyes at me .
"whoa , i am salivating as i write this ."
worst part of all .
why do i need another blender ?
i chose multigrain bread for the sandwich .
"- rrb - , and the chicken ."
what is so hard about <UNK> and <UNK> ?
great place for a sunday all day happy hour !
"yes , ca n't wait !"
"great servers and bartenders , too ."

"hmm , i thought this place was a-ok ."
i highly suggest heading to the eastern location .
do n't think we would go back .
so now <UNK> got pushed to tuesday .
this restaurant just seems to get it perfect everytime !
we <UNK> potato pancakes and a pretzel for appetizers .
our favorite item was the arepa .
definitely a good choice .
check the back left for clearance .
i ate half and took the rest home .
you must inquire about any other allergies .
"needless to say , we are never going back ."
the fries are also very good !
bellagio knows how to do pasta !
. which my boyfriend specifically requested .
we ordered house fried rice .
i try others but they are never as good .
and their onion rings were perfectly prepared !
the food a very bland but pretty good .
we practically licked the bowls clean .
i had the italian sandwich and tomato soup .
my burger was raw in the center .
so be cautious about going here .
i would love to hang here .
0 - rrb - take your time .
"by 0pm , this place was <UNK> ."
it was disgusting in flavor and texture .
"- rrb - , and <UNK> roll ."
now i go to spinatos !

perfect with some butter .
the breakfast is always my fav here .
we will definitely be coming back !
especially on our netflix days in .

my pool looks fantastic all thanks to them !
<UNK> <UNK> is always a hit !
the fish was like butter .
did someone say cheese ?
he said this place will try and burn you .
the beach club is always crowded with attractive people .
sunday 0: 00 pm and starving .

this location is always great .

so not impressed with this place .
i ordered this butterscotch chocolate chip pie .
food taste is horrible and never go back .
i really enjoyed the clown punch .
or just ask for the fried <UNK> .

tl ; dr : great theater !
home made tartar sauce .
the apple pie moonshine was like a dessert too .

i felt it was a must !
my kids and husband are picky eaters !
the batter was bland and the crepes slightly chewy .

they make your beverage with love and it shows .
carson is the best and the pizza is amazing .
they will do you right !
still totally reasonable given the quality .
friendly staff & great lunch specials .
that alone is worth a high rating to me !
and of course the drinks were delicious !
this used to be our only stop for vapes .
i did not like it either way .
our waiter was not with it at all .
- rsb - ck : ` ` keri !
- rsb - vegetables and fruits are fresh .
hopefully for the restaurant week dinner .
<UNK> too overprice for the portion you get !
"also , they have outdoor seating !"
my favorite is the live bee <UNK> they have .
i kid you not .
and it was really hard to climb out .
the positive is that the staff here is classy .
but the prices are great .
"the waitress was overly attentive , but nice ."
"omg , so tired ."
bathrooms are very clean too .
they were all sooo good .
sound is really good too .
"prices are decent , service was good ."
the hollywood hip room is just a regular room .
pieces were still a bit crunchy .
glad to know they still are out there .
you ' ll get the worst experience .

this place made me laugh so hard .
i love the spanakopita and the vegetarian sampler .

that being said my review is about meet santa .
they do have an extensive in-room dining options .
i did n't even finish my food .
she was fabulous getting my alterations done .
i ' m so confused .
"and yes , she really was ."
"nevertheless , two thumbs up for decent chinese food !"
"well , let ' s begin with the facts ."
try the garlic knots .
their food is always consistent .
i will definitely go back .
this is truly my favorite pizza restaurant .
"after dinner , we went to the club upstairs ."
margaritas were strong and refreshing .

this place was disappointing !
i do not recommend this place .
what a neat little place .
not too appetizing if you ' re getting sushi .
since the table was so easily overlooked .
my fiance and i were in the daisy building .
. deliciousness on a plate .
dessert is also good .
it just needed something else .
we loved every bit of it .

the food was very good !
i guess we are glutton for punishment ... .
bbq chicken is moist but not much bbq flavoring .
"food was ok , but could be better ."
i enjoyed my breakfast .
they had a great patio and bar area .
the amazing peppermill restaurant is also very close .

wine is good and very reasonably priced .
"he was fast , pleasant , efficient ."
i probably wont be back .
service way too enthusiastic .
and uh ... the cookies !
soon after our starters came out .

clean restaurant with fantastic service and food .
you go back into your room smelling like cigarettes .
"as for it being local , no ."
disappointed my neighborhood fav decided to go this direction .
you know the food is made to order !
but they still need chairs !
two drinks and under $ 00 with tip .
"however , service was not on the same level ."
such a waste of a trip to vegas .
that and their super nachos should be illegal .
that will be the true test !
the restaurant onsite has delicious food and great cocktails .
i love that many many many choices you have .
the whole experience was great .
i also had the sweet potatoes tots .
definitely will be back !
thanks lucky strike team !

the worst part is the bathrooms .
the staff were super friendly and chatty .
every dish we had was so tasty and flavorful .
check in is 0pm .
i committed to going all out during this buffet .

we left because the cigarette smoke was so strong .
he also cleaned my ceramic tiles in the kitchen .
only my absolute favorite coffee shop in the valley .
pizzas were different and delicious .

so juicy and flavourful .
"in fact , none of us did ."
this is the best rubio ' s in town .
this theatre was magical !
there is a lot to do around the hotel .

the food has an authentic fresh quality !
the naan was perfectly textured .
servers at bar were <UNK> nice .

"spotty service , though ."
i decided on the french macarons .
service is fast and friendly .
the portions are heaping and generous .
what a fun discovery !
tamale bites were disappointing .
i go here for breakfast often !
i like that they always offer me a sample .
i wouldnt go back .

have been coming to mc ' s forever .
prices are ridiculous for the size .
"ah , arizona mills ... ."

we were the only ones in the restaurant .
great wings and pizza and definitely worth the price .
decor is simple and restaurant is smallish .
waiter who aims to please - fantastic .

this is my favorite sushi spot .
the meat was questionable and cut into tiny pieces .

the best thing was the pear and endive salad .
"all have background checks , btw ."
she did perk up prior to expected tip time .
i ' ve only been there for dinner .

i feel very blessed to have found this practice !
"it was fine , but just fine ."
we used to frequent this ayce .

one of the highlights was the apple bread pudding .
the food was fine and the staff was friendly .
"wo n't go back , that ' s for sure"
paige was our server and she was super friendly .

"okay , so they are all about the rice ."
it ' s nestled in a small food court .
their hotel just sucks .

i love coming here .
steer clear if spicy is not your thing .
the front desk staff was so nice and helpful .

maybe because of the delivery time .
i found the mango margarita to be my favorite !
the pricing was great and the portions were large .
she was very friendly and fun .
she came back over with our drinks .

the employees were soo rude and annoying .
i hardly had to wait for anything / anyone .
deliciously fresh and gourmet !
what a yummy burger .
they changed their bread !
then the server took our orders .
and i know why .
the bride was <UNK> .
"why , you ask ?"
i love this starbucks location .
no room for dessert .
"the fried , diced potatoes were not very warm ."
"food was ok , and the service was horrible ."
cherry blossom roll a definite winner !
in all ways - this library rocks !
first time partying outdoors !
overall great place to go !
we particularly had good service .
the customer service was excellent and very personable .
i got a margarita for $ 0.00 .
she pulls it out of the little warmer box !
"yes , please and thank you ."
lets just say my phone call was very unpleasant .
i could not believe it .
def going back when we are back in vegas .
my favorite place in vegas !
i do n't like it .
i think they were actually quite generous .
"however , this fried ice cream is great !"
i ' d go again .
it ' s right in the middle of everything .
the staff is friendly and attentive .
we absolutely loved it .
"if i could , i would give zero stars ."
more than enough for two to share .
. which is sad because they tasted great !
my dress was everything i wanted and more .
. could have used some ac !
"fresh , tasty , clean ."
service is super super slow .
"sadly , we will not go back ."
it was just fantastic and very beautifully presented .
his response was ` ` like most people right ?
even my beloved deviled eggs were over-hyped .
lots of garlic and ricotta cheese .
they are soooo speedy .
we also tried a margarita .
- the chips were especially good .
they are friendly and professional .
i got the shrimp chimichanga and it was horrible .
lastly hubby had the mushroom ravioli .
they have some pretty good deals on food too .
thank you for caring enough about what we think !
my bf had the <UNK> and it was fab !
"this joint , does exactly that ."
the atmosphere was welcoming and clean .
"time to <UNK> , fox restaurants ."
but that ' s just me .
they even have a little cafe which is perfect .
"yes , the signature has gotten me spoiled ."
i love the service .
his asparagus was cold too .
the sauce was both sweet and savory .
my favorite is the ` ` little boy blue .
he went somewhere and never came back .
this a vegas gem !
we somehow ended up here again today .
i recommend this if in the city !
the price is fantastic .
the show lasted 0.0 hours with an opening act .
definitely will not be coming back .
it was definitely packed .
food was good but the customer service was awful .
their lavender infused latte is actually really good !
def not the best i ' ve ever had .
i am in love .
we are going back today !
do n't do it !
i went twice last week for lunch .
"quaint , lovely and priced perfect ."
it felt like a perfect fit to me .
the loose leaf tea was quite yummy though .
so <UNK> take a look at that .
this was my first time stopping at great harvest .
i ' m sure i will eat here again .
"try the stuffed olives appetizer , yum !"
i just ate here .
the performances are amazing !
it is n't that difficult !
it ' s a pretty good deal .
water cups cost 00 cents !
they also take coupons .
i will not be going back .
been here three times and i still crave it .
all we did the whole time was complain .
we ate outside with a beautiful view of fountains .
i got food poisoning from this place !
"just go , okay ?"
this place will always be a favorite of mine !
. and the worst part still no migraine relief .
i will never eat there again .
the drinks and food are fantastic !
"the bacon was generous and crispy , not limp ."
i ordered the fish tacos last friday .
we did n't see our waitress for 00 minutes .
service was pretty good .
i also had a strawberry shake .
the wait can be ridiculous even with a reservation .
a must go : - rrb - delicious !
i love that they ' re open so late !
really enjoyed my lunch .
it ' s clean but old .
everyone is very friendly .
"yes , he ' s that easy ."
happy hour specials are great too .
the rooms are clean and the view is nice .
this is just ridiculous and annoying .
it is everywhere and is an institution .
also tried the wings .
at least at night .
i wo n't return .
pizza is unique and really yummy !
my nurse there was amazing as well .
they did n't turn it off until about 0:00 .
perfect when re-heated for breakfast .
". nails , and <UNK> ."
do n't bring your car there !
"first off , the atmosphere is great !"
i mean do n't get me wrong .
"hot and <UNK> , just little balls of perfection ."
i really love the pistachio !
the potato pancakes were greasy with little flavor .
it was just ok .
a normal starbucks place .
probably wo n't ever come back to this venue .
the scorpion roll melted in our mouths .
before i finished one wing my main meal came .
wish we had a mac shack at home .
thank you for such a great service and product .
i ordered a french martini for starter .
there are tours constantly going through the place .
it is basically a cute motel 0 .
and the five stars goes to ... .
amazing southern atmosphere and staff .
i had a great time here !
the food is also amazing .
"overall , we really enjoyed dining at giada ."
the staff are friendly and helpful .
very nice vibe there .
this was honestly the best burger ever !
we had an unforgettable time .
usually i love paradise cafã © .
<UNK> ... satisfied my sweet tooth .
service was really good .
great for asu students - they offer a discount !
when i asked for her supervisor .
that just means i ate fewer fries .
i decided on the chicken <UNK> .
they are always super friendly !
i will be back !
follows through on those <UNK> .
- rrb - of cheese melted on top .
would not recommend sharing !
the cream spinach equally matches it .
the interior is charming but small .
i would try it again for breakfast .
i was sure that angels themselves made my drink .
our appetizers also came out after our entrees .
my husband does n't so we had to compromise .
now this is a sandwich !
i love karaoke q !
i just wanted to take our order and leave .
definitely more little kid than little italy .
is a box spring needed ?
"i also had cappuccino , which was awesome !"
"sauces , watery and quite disgusting ."
the bacon was smoky and <UNK> .
"yes , we made a mistake ."
not as dry as when i first had it .
high tea here is awesome to say the least .
we were not disappointed .
i do n't understand .
because the banana tempura was out of this world !
"- rrb - but , i digress ."
their staff is wonderful as well .
love love love this farmer ' s market !
finally at 0:00 we got our table .
: - lrb - just my luck ... .
the guacamole had no favor at all .
"really , really hard ."
perfect amount of cheese .
not that i ' ve had that happen ... .
some from happy hour some from regular menu .
includes a mini fridge .
our server matt was exceptional .
her support was key to our success !
very cute breakfast \ lunch spot .
everything was served hot and beautifully plated .
someone is usually at your table within 00 seconds .
i had the blueberry waffles which was so-so .
we went here for brunch today .
give it a try !
ambiance and decor : wow .
he hooked me up with a perfect itinerary .
0 or 0 stars ?
i want to return for a tasting menu soon !
drinks were great and the service was too .
"so , i would not return here ."
i love the homey feeling this little gem offers .
cosmo also had great pens for conference .
my friend grabbed some calamari for the table .
definitely will be back .
- lrb - who wants to drink warm vodka ?
we would definitely go back to burger bar !
best place for dinner !
turkey meatball appetizer was delicious !
best part was dessert : gelato .
do not order grilled cheese pesto sandwich !
so much to choose from .
none of the high end spas have hot robes .
. this also is a valentines gift .
i get my little dog groomed here .
it was n't overly sweet .
beautiful place with a great rooftop patio .
0 full bathrooms with showers .
i would definitely recommend this hotel .
there should have been american cheese as well .
this food was seriously disgusting .
"and , it filled me up !"
our waitress was so good .
he treats his clients with respect .
thanks for my new favorite place in phoenix !
the food here is always amazing .
it was n't just one part of the restaurant .
i highly recommend the place !
- rrb - the pizza ' s alright .
it ' s not too loud or annoying .
do n't do it !
does n't mean i ' m broke lol .
the insides are always soft and fluffy .
this is a specialty sweet coffee kinda place .
$ 00 for your meal and a monster mimosa .
"had delicious sangria , and mussels ."
the pineapple chicken fried rice was so gross .
and it ' s tasteless .
service - 0 stars !
love the vibe and all they offer .
the oysters were fresh and sweet .
all of it is always excellent .
i was my families favorite buffet .
reception did n't offer to upgrade .
the feta fries were delicious .
"chewy and no flavor , do n't get it !"
dr <UNK> is great !

the pizza is tasty too .
we could have easily shared one plate .
husband had the burger and the flavor is unmatched .
definitely an experience i ' ll share on facebook .
the breakfast was decent for continental buffet .
the prices for these dishes were super cheap !
unfortunately i ca n't remember her name .
the monkey brains in particular were memorable .
an excellent experience through and through !
my favorite thing is the combo bun .
tacos are also very good .
they skimped on toppings ; poor quality ingredients .
we drive 00 miles from home to get one .
thanks for a great evening ! !
my prickly pear margarita was fantastic .
there is also a drive-thru .
we came around 00am .
we ordered and chose a seat outside .
and excellent idea of chairs outside !

the food was delicious .
"the chicken fingers here are fresh , never frozen ."
shout out to dj aoki !

we were very touched by our great experience !
i enjoyed the queso much more than the alfredo .
best fish taco i ' ve ever had .

our waiter was friendly and super energetic !
what is not to love about the paris ?
i ' ll never trust anyone else with them !

"she said , ` ` oh , to go ?"
. service was amazing .
i will order from here again .

then he got a scone .
but you can barely tell when you get inside .
she had magical hands !
however the rooms are themed which is pretty neat .
' ' he was wrong .
but oh my the lines were long .
my favorite location for special event .
but order ahead or away from the lunch hour .
i would eat you everyday .
the food is addictive .
my screen was completely cracked on my iphone 0 .
then i had the vegan <UNK> burrito .
visit <UNK> is worth every penny !
service was friendly and with a smile .
such a great find !
hence the slightly hidden spot .
the bread is so soft and delicious .
this was definitely a hearty meal .
they just need management !
do n't shop at sears !
i had the turkey chive crepe eggs .
he was incredibly accommodating and efficient .
both dishes were awesome and the portions are huge .
"each time , i do n't pay at all ."
my friends did like their sorbets .
a decent price for a quality meal .
my husbands ham and cheese sandwhich was ` okay .
cheese one was chewy and flavorful .
i tried a piece .
i really appreciate his attentiveness .
hubby and i enjoyed ourselves so much .
they fresh fruit is excellent !
they extended the place with a beautiful terrace .
i stayed and enjoyed looking around .
i ' m sorry what ?
stay away for it is highly addictive .
` ` glad we had this talk .
sushi kaya : identity crisis ?
"if you build it , eaters will come !"
it gives the place a very comforting mood .
the servers at the restaurants were friendly and personable .
highly recommend this place !
0 dollars should mean a big bowl of food .
the lecture starts at 0:00 and is very informative .
maybe that ' s just me .
unfortunately the seats are too close together .
it is very quick and convenient .
"the portions are large , but not overly so ."
bacon was hot not overdone .
my <UNK> said she is so happy .
my friends devoured the crab legs .
"i could not taste any alcohol , just sugar ."
he had a newport hanging out his mouth .
but the staff is very friendly !
and they changed it to my favorite team chargers .
i ' m in heaven .
"i mixed texture , garlic and salt ."
i only write good reviews .
the girls that work there are helpful as well .
my prime rib was pretty ... lifeless .
they do offer coffee and tea all night though .
what an unexpected treat !
those curried veggies were pretty bomb too .
very small and not even mixed well .
half of it does n't even have a screen .
i love this place .
"after my last wash , my earrings went missing ."
you were awesome great customer service .
i eat here a few times a week !
thank goodness it was only 0 of us .
my only dig : nearly everything is fried .
what a nice touch !
"ha ha , not sure - rrb - ."
but some of the items here were higher end .
or maybe they ' re just regulars .
"oh , and the hours are great ."
what a fun night !
did n't look at it .
my husband and i love <UNK> ' s !
there was some trouble getting the bill straightened out .
"had the shrimp tacos , and everything was fresh ."
i could n't have been happier .
sweet potato fries perfectly done .
wait for the table .

"the restaurant decor is simple , but nice ."
it was all sorts of yumminess .
it was delicious and service was quick and friendly .
i love their late night hours as well .
the service was great and very warm .
looking around the one room was amazing .
finally ... the cheese .
we had reservations and were seated quickly .
well am i am glad i did !
i asked an employee who contacted the bulk manager .
this driver does n't even deserve the 0 star .
"amazing , tasty bowls of goodness !"
she does however love the unit itself .
clothing is cheaply made and overpriced .
he definitely added to our experience there .
complimentary chips and salsa are pretty good .
it was a good deal .
"clean , friendly and faster service this time ."
the staff is always friendly and nice .
sponge cake tasted really moist and soft .
"portions are good , had leftovers ."
did i just say that ?
such a polite staff and a nice clean facility .
i could take a bath in this burrata .
i remember it when it was brand new .
we decided to use our voucher last friday .
it ' s creamy and sweet ... very delicious !
the salsas were completely different from other restaurants .
the entire time she kept saying it was imaginative .
we requested outside seating .

she ' s attentive & friendly .
i really am disappointed with this company .

the pool tables are kept nice as well .
super affordable and the coffee was strong .
spicy tuna roll - very very tasty .
gelato was yummy too !
the thai tea was also good .
brian is super awesome .
cut ok but i ' ve seen better .
rudest woman at the cheese counter .
best combination of toppings ever .

he ' s also an incredible piercer .
i feel like i got a great deal .
"other than that , great spot !"
"attentive service , food was good , little pricey ."
the <UNK> apple chicken salad is to die for !
everyone who works there is so nice .

that was in september .
the quality of the food is amazing .
expensive for that kind of price .
the server was really nice .

"they still gave us exceptional , friendly service ."
the full montagu versus the original earl ' s ?
"everything , repeat everything was savory and delicious ."
the fajitas were good .
"came here for dinner , it was great !"
i recommend him to all my friends .
they special order strange foods for me 0 .
another one of my lunch time favorites .
"in spite of that , i still loved it ."
i highly recommend it .
it is a busy location .
pros : convenient location .
"seriously , they ' re tiny ."
"0 carne asada tacos to go , please !"
skip the country club .
this is a wonderful authentic greek restaurant .
loved the t-shirt as well .
i absolutely love blue martini .
they make climbing so much fun for beginners .
"since then , we always go back !"
"glad to have them close by , another plus ."
he kept me inform thru the process .
"if i need something , i ' ll call ."
the food was completely decent .
just do it ... .
all of which were delicious .
tasted like a chalky green tea powder mix .
the one saving grace was the wonton soup .
shrimp tempura had little flavor to it .
got ta get er done !
the wine list was pretty good .
there are definitely better bars around !
they also brought out a plate of miniature cookies .
"sorry , but just being totally honest here ."
but i did n't .
thrifty ice cream in between two homemade cookies ?
it came out to about $ 0 per person .
"i left , incredibly pissed ."
i would n't stay here again .
i thought that was great .
the service was amazing .
my boyfriend ordered the tofu stir fry .
the rooms are amazing !
outstanding food ! ! ! portions are huge .
i had the gnocchi with beef tongue .
"the office is clean and , almost homey ."
lunch was a hit !
my fav is the honey hot .
it is absolutely stunning after dusk !
ummm ... $ 00 for ruining my weekend getaway ?
last night was my second time at this location .
all things a print shop should offer .
but totally worth it .
i used to love coming here on college nights .
it ' s to die for .
brunswick you say ? ! oh yes .
got ta cut calories somewhere !
it was very satisfying .
their soft tofu soups are so delicious !
and a huge dance floor at that .

but we decided on sharing .
"with her bad attitude , i will never return ."
my new fave property in vegas ...
get everything on it !
the high school aged staff kinda drives me nuts .
its all good tho .
do n't miss this one peeps !
no body was going to defend this poor girl .
i am beyond pissed .
the atmosphere was gorgeous !
not a bad choice at all !
she was very nice just slow .
we are happy campers !
less than impressive customer service .
it was so damn good !
sadly it was mediocre at best .
' ' cool vibes and fun colors .
i did it too .
i had a bite and it was delicious .
great place to eat sushi !
would definitely go again !
i loved this hotel .
happy to have a nice neighborhood sushi place .
and every week they gave me the same story .
very disappointing as i love verrado and main street .
i got two turkey and cheese and a meatloaf .
i will definitely take them here .
the chicken parm was soooo good .
an african grey ... .
not very appetizing looking .
what an amazing experience i had here today !
but who wants to when you have millie .
our server was pretty good .
she was very unhappy looking and was wearing sweats .
north is one of my favorite restaurants .
"spicy pork is tender , juicy , and flavorful ."
servers were not knowledgeable about the menu .
he was excited to figure it out .
. i love domino ' s !
<UNK> & orgasmic flavors .
the grits were bland .
then i found out how much it cost .
"staff is friendly , the atmosphere was simply wonderful ."
perfect portions with a homemade taste .
i ' m totally a fan !
but we totally indulged .
"however , the ambiance at dinner is more romantic ."
our meals came piping hot .
they have some of the best french fries .
well he never did .
she was an amazing waitress .
it was overall delish .
the staff that were working tonight were amazing !
my husband and i visited this weekend from michigan .
we ' ve always been treated great .
the carbonation really starts to catch up to you .
it tasted like a brownie .
this place is clean and great !
i was hoping for more flavor .
: - rrb - let ' s get real .
i ' ll watch anything for $ 0 .
the food they had was delicious .
the good : i really like the menu here .
i felt like we had committed a crime .
there was a lot of space .
"worst hotel , horrible service , and rude employees ."
so much for patient <UNK> .
looked at all the photos for the dishes .
and you get free parking with the pass .
their rooms are like <UNK> .
everything was so salty .
"to die for , delish !"
it was so good !
i ' m giving this place 0 stars .
we wont be back .
we had to wait for him and explain everything .
it was gross and their service was worse .
"our first time there , the bartender was great ."
i would recommend <UNK> to everyone .
it was definitely my first pinky up dining experience .
we had front row seats .
that is me eating a la <UNK> chimichanga .
big portions and great prices .
i have never gone in and left <UNK> .
the appraisal took a quick 00 minutes .
do n't waste your money .
green tea : tasted like the cast iron pot .
the patio is gorgeous .
the atmosphere is lovely with chandeliers and good lighting .
she was the only good thing about this experience .
it was good and the presentation was okay .
flying saucer is similar to this place .
even the tsa is super friendly here .
he said he preferred the veal .
it reminded me of christmas in a funny way .
the waitress was really nice too .
she said okay and gave me the total .
loved the crispy taco shell .
great customer service and really helpful .
lol i love them .
we had leftovers for two days !
fast service and great car wash !
pork chop was phenomenal !
i can rave about ellis island all day .
the atmosphere was hip .
okay it ' s time to relax .
it made things really uncomfortable .
<UNK> was extra helpful on our last day .
now served <UNK> for $ 00.00 !
the thai curry was my favorite i think .
the ceviche was really tasty too .
we wo n't be back .
ca n't go wrong with any combination .
we had : 0 .
this was a random surprise .
"seriously , i was a wreck ."
the food is always so good .
her new salon is so great !
so glad my friend recommended <UNK> .
my husband brought me food home the first time .
do n't suggest there at all .
almost a little overwhelming .
so why not 0 stars ?
room service was always helpful and efficient .
i could n't decide for a while .
? ? ? that ' s disgusting .
these were pretty disappointing .
ordered the onion soup and a blt roll .
no crushed tomato sauce .
really was n't impressed .
we were pleasantly surprised this time around .
i usually have them add salmon to it .
perfect on its own or with bread .
had a wonderful dinner here a few weeks ago .
stick to the good drinks .
the sliders were awesome .
they have bollywood videos on at all times .
loved it so much i made reservations for brunch
had the regular zinburger and it was perfect !
and i love their back to school commercials .
do not recommend this location !
everything we ordered was delicious in its own way .
hubby thought <UNK> deep tissue was average .
dutch bros over starbucks any day !
and make sure to add vegetables .
i totally recommend this place !
i was very pleased with the service .
the s'mores dessert however was delightful and decadent .
it was super funny .
but what am i supposed to do ?
yes its busy but they have way better deals .
i always get a cheese enchilada with rice .
pricing is very reasonable .
i love this place .
"the atmosphere was trendy , yet comfortable ."
"other than that , the food was super yummy !"
i would definitely recommend them !
but that ' s not likely to happen .
they were all very attentive towards our table .
i thought that they probably spit in our food .
really ? ? very annoying !
favorite bar in tempe marketplace !
first time to stay here .
i love this man to death !
- rrb - that had an unpleasant after taste .
this place is amazing .
"coffee is great , grassroots neighborhood coffee house ."
` ` it came off .
- rrb - pieces of clam .
so ` ` eh ' ' on the fries .
i had ordered the shrimp meal .
the wiseguy had sausage and caramelized onions on it .
great <UNK> my <UNK> .
why are n't the anchovies & olives listed ?
we also ordered two fountain sodas .
the chicken on the mac and cheese was meh .
how much you ask ?
in my opinion a stupid move .
good service too mmmm !
"they are slow , and i mean slow ."
do not eat here .
"the menu looked good , especially the drinks ."
service was actually awesome and food was good .
service is friendly although not too fast .
this was our first time here .
the flavors are amazing .
i will compliment them on that .
you can take your kids here .
"atmosphere , service and food are all 0 stars !"
desserts were also yummy !
this place is dangerous !
family owned and very nice people !
i love this place !
the place had a great decor as well !
thank you express lube .
"this is the best part , though ."
the staff has been very friendly .
i thought it was very sweet and thoughtful .
wanting to hear britney spears ?
i just rarely give 0 stars .
i ' m a patient diner .
i also ordered the pork arepa .
their chicken katsu curry is to die for .
i was not expecting it to be that big .
"however , i would definitely try something else ."
this place is wonderful !
they would have given my husband a business card .
"so , 0/0 is 000 % falafel fail rate ."
what a phenomenal experience .
i wo n't hesitate to go there again .
thank you so much for a great evening !
this shop is awesome .
fab location and amenities .
a perfect place for a satisfying lunch !
we ordered two desserts to share for the table .
and i want that sandwich .
im not sure how their ratings are so high .
i do n't even like blueberries in my pancakes !
not a single smile !
its a little extreme .
"girl problems , i know !"
do n't waste your time people .
0 of 0 were chewy .
not crazy about hot and spicy foods .
was it worth the calories ?
i will definitely come back here many times .
"but at this point , it was too late ."
we reported it to the hotel staff .
i can not recommend her enough .
we seat out side .
their grilled chicken is delicious !
the shakes are phenomenal !
she is very professional and truly gifted .
a sexy man hole .
there was nothing to complain about .
i bring my family here whenever we want pizza !
the hostess looked right at us the walked away .
great vibe lots of fun and shopping .
there were n't too many people here .
they never called him at all .
definitely recommend for a quite dinner out !
mash potatoes here are really tasty !
mexican food is not hard to make .
wonderful place for a great casual meal !
i ' ll definitely be back !
the tacos on the other hand were pretty yummy !
the <UNK> here are not boring .
they were super friendly .
i honestly do not know alot about hawaiian food .
my husband and i each enjoyed the fish fry .
the green one was my favorite .
most of these were $ 0-0 a piece .
' ' this place is foul .
how it works : 0 .
i like cottage cheese .
i did n't care for either .
they ' re very <UNK> .
"this , too , was aesthetically pleasing ."
they service our home in chandler .
fresh corn salsa with tortilla chips .
everything tasted fresh and really delicious .
price is definitely good for the portion size .
"silly me , wanting to much ."
can i just tell you all my story ?
i always appreciate genuine customer service .
a lot of children !
portions are small but not too small .
"four people for $ 00 , crazy !"
it ' s definitely a hole in the wall .
do n't worry it ' s worth finding .
"for 00 dollars a pop , totally worth it !"
"but anywho , the food was to die for !"
00 minutes in drive-thru .
it was ideal sweetness for me and very creamy .
the food was just mediocre .

the flatbreads were a hit though !
amanda is really great at what she does !
"good dj , decent dance space , overpriced drinks ."
service pretty slow but really enjoyed the arepa benny .
i had a very pleasant experience here .
they have 00-00 floors .
but the wine list is impressive !
this is n't slacking .
the tea was perfectly sweetened .
i definitely would n't go back .
. shoes and more ... shoes !
we got to the room .
the service was great .
"well , guess what ... ."
truly one of the worst meals / experiences ever .
the service is fast .
my one suggestion is to bring your own toiletries .
everything we have ordered has been good .
smoothies for the kiddos .
try the chocolate croissant .
sake bombs are cheap and definitely worth it !
cashier was <UNK> and took way too long .
we were n't disappointed .
machines down ... no notice .
they have tea samples that even my husband liked .
no skimping on spice .
had a super great time at drais ! ! !
i really really like this place .
<UNK> is perfect for late night food .
donate if you can !

this place was a delightful find !
norman ' s service was phenomenal .
"friend had catfish and grits , i had jambalaya ."

i ' d stay here again .
it was about a foot long !
the atmosphere was great as well .
look forward to coming back again !
it started with the thai coconut shrimp soup .
the sauce was bland .
but my fiancã © was super disappointed .
several other tables came and went while we dined .
"we had some wings , burger and salad ."
i also always get the scallops here .
its almost like being trapped at the dmv .
there were two young women working .
we love this place !
definitely best benedict in town !
so light and not too sweet .
the pizza was okay .
they do n't even acknowledge you .
"the tacos were flavorful , the coffee was great ."
they walk around and interact with the audience .
everything on the menu is amazing .
easily the best wax i ' ve gotten .
the restaurant was beautiful .
give ' em a try !
i always get a <UNK> .
nice addition to downtown .
thought i was going to die .

"most delicious sandwiches ever , i had seconds !"
my dining partner had the <UNK> steak breakfast .
"light , fluffy , and very very <UNK> !"
they were super helpful and efficient .
service is pretty ok .
my only complaint is the customer service .
the waiter was attentive .
i love modo yoga .
we never got the specials .
we sat outside at the bar .
great dessert to share .
i loved the patio seating .
"the mimosa , typical ."
they were very accommodating to our needs .
! ! ! i will definately return often
we had a wonderful experience overall !
the prices are great especially on the produce .
we were thrilled to see <UNK> on the menu .
he even tracked down my mother .
no cover ... try the gummy bear cocktail !
there when you need them and never overbearing .
i still have to do a review about it .
i ordered the ahi tuna steak tartare .
i hope they can keep the doors open .
it reminded me of ikea for a moment .
best mojito i ' ve had ever !
"sadly , they ran out on this occasion ."
this place is so sweet .
"however , everything we choose was pretty good ."
will not be back .
"good , with one exception !"
"nothing , the entire night ."
i will say that pure is beautiful .
the employees were very friendly and helpful .
i had the pretzel appetizer tonight .
. it ' s close by !
every bite was pure perfection .
and a margarita without salt on the rim ?
the trunk was n't even opened .
awesome place for brunch .
we started with the <UNK> and <UNK> .
another prefect amount of flavors and spice .
"crispy , hot , and delicious mmmm ."
"yum , yum , yum ."
mussels were cooked to perfection .
so here ' s a discount for you !
the milkshake was worth it .
the cashier is also very nice .
"but , we did n't know they had food ."
"ordered the gyro wrap , which was delicious ."
i believe cm and i waited about 00-00 min .
i would highly recommend !
they got a pull-out couch bed and a jacuzzi .
- rrb - the raspberry margarita is delicious .
dinner with my husband made it extra special !
<UNK> ' s steak salad for life !
this place is extremely ` ` meh ' ' .
"overall , very friendly staff !"
i think ... i ... .
i walked out with 0 different kinds of fudge .
he said the guys already threw them out .
this place gave us food poisoning !
they ordered trial contacts for me also .
i waited until 00:00 .
"black bra , nothing else under there ."
so even this one is a gift .
"if i could give 0 stars , i would ."
not an easy task .
i highly recommend this restaurant .
i would add more stars if i could .
no crazy jumping or dancing .
nypd ' s got it covered .
a much better experience this time .
it ' s a nice perk .
we hit the wave pool first which hb loved .
i really had high hopes for this place .
i love to get photos on aluminum and glass .
small little bakery in mekong palace .
i will stick with goodwill .
awesome karaoke bar and lots of fun with friends !
"tried the blood orange cosmo , it was okay ."
- rrb - i take my sweet kitty here .
great place to meet friends !
the servers are really nice .
food was so amazing .
then why would you make me pull up ?
i would not recommend this location for this test .
i hope i can use them in the future .
will definitely come back .
. turn on both !
would eat here again in a heartbeat .
we ' re talking mammoth huge !
i was so annoyed by that .
i guess you get what you pay for .
the staff were incredibly warm & friendly .
and ya know what ?
"oh yes , there are children there too ."
i will definitely go back .
the service that night was particularly slow .
visited recently for the first time .
this is a company with a lot of integrity .
totally worth the $ 0 .
i felt like one was never enough .
they also offer heartier breakfast items like burritos !
"great service , very friendly and attentive ."
it ' s a great concept .
ate at paradise cafe for breakfast .
they dared me to sue them .
the rooms are disgusting .
restaurant has a nice ambiance .
this place was really good !
the meat inside was very tender and moist .
intimate - lrb - <UNK> - rrb - seating .
the prices are also inexpensive .
this review is n't about that .
this location is bigger than the south park <UNK> .
rare steak was fresh and not chewy .
"food was great , atmosphere fun , service good !"
i ' d for sure come back .
"that is , if you also like rude people ."
meat is not supposed to be fluffy .
i will give 0 stars .
food took a long time to arrive .
"very cute , well stocked store ."
took forever to get our food .
and perhaps every subsequent visit after that .
perfectly seasoned and still gooey inside .
"again , filling and delicious ."
just heaven really ... .
. she took my pot of coffee .
i took to go oxtail pho special .
there was 00 of us .
the concierge person was so rude to us .
a legit hole-in-the-wall mexican restaurant !
totally worth a checkout .
<UNK> and christian are fantastic bartenders .
you have got to see it to believe it .
he told me tuesday of the change over .
the juke box takes your picture !
customer service is friendly and easy-going .
so what is a girl to do ?
the food and service is good .
first time in vegas but loved this place !
"other than that , i was disappointed ."
' ' i fell in love with this woman !
they all had a great time !
cute little place with some on street parking .
i ' m cool with that .
i would say this meal is really heavy though .
very disappointed in the quality .
a less than stellar night was had by all .
our waiter darren was pleasant and knowledgeable .
my car looks like new again !
escape to a tropical oasis !
"its open 00 hours , seven days a week ."
uh ... well that sucks !
all have something for everyone .
finally someone started on one of us around 0000 .
will def go back .
parking lot is clean and restrooms too !
by far my favorite restaurant in charlotte .
"husband had the meatloaf , mouthwatering yumminess ."
i ' ve had great service both times too .
their atmosphere is comfortable and clean at all times !
menu needs a lot of work .
so last night went to <UNK> .
we both started with a cesar salad .
i am really getting into the <UNK> food scene .
"again , i ' m sorry ."
we split a dinner and lobster bisque .
i was super duper sick .
the burger sliders are awesome !
the pricing also is not worth it .
"oh by the way , her name is carrie ."
i do shop at br all over the country .
"she is so helpful , knowledgeable , and caring ."
this place is joke !
"sadly , <UNK> ' s palace recently closed ."
but finally he returned .
the carrot rum cake was the perfect finish .
it was sooo good .
upon arriving to the restaurant i was immediately impressed .
maybe next time i will ask for extra dressing .
i will keep coming back .
perfect balance of coffee and white chocolate .
i was pleasantly surprised from the get go .
would not go back .
the wait between appetizers and entrees was really long .
would definitely eat here again .
i ' m not joking .
"' ' yes , please !"
i will probably stay elsewhere next time .
people have moved out due to lots of problems .
the sashimi was pretty good .
i was n't impressed .
i ' ve never felt so disrespected .
. workers always seem to be running around .
the staff is so sweet and kind .
"i will , however , order the gyro again ."
the whole family agrees !
was the same out there as it was inside !
chef oscar came around and spoke with us .
we never even got drinks !
management switch or something .
not even a hint of spice .
i would n't order this dessert again .
it came with a <UNK> butter .
what happen to the hostess ?
hubby had a pint of <UNK> and angry orchard .
the bouncers were disrespectful with the ladies and guys .
homemade and very fresh .
prefer the curry from papaya thai .
the warm bread basket had three different baked goodies .
did i mention how pretty the place was ?
this is not a family restaurant .
we used the groupon .
"i went last week , after work at 00pm ."
they have conference rooms for your study groups !
"the venue is cute and comfy , very minimal ."
am i glad i did .
"needless to say , we wo n't be back ."
i love this place .
"i got the gnocchi , which was cooked perfectly ."
was it a good deal ?
other tables were getting their orders wrong .
now that ' s service !
amazing wine and amazing people .
really so you own summerlin maids ?
he was very kind and <UNK> .
seemed appropriate for the tuesday night .
what a delightful car and what a delightful experience .
the flavor was pretty good though .
we frequented the famous spa during our stay .
food was fresh and flavorful .
looking forward to next month !
too bad that was the only benefit .
still ... we wished they were really pies .
"totally felt <UNK> , but whatever ."
the flavoring was off .
i had gotten swedish massage .
hubby had the skewers .
great food and coffee !
"okay , so its a target ."
this place has really tasty food !
j calls in the order .
so he was happy .
the gumbo the last time we were there ?
very good mix of goodies for sure .
and the salad was yummy .
encore provided just that .
never been to a better coffee shop !
"0 - rrb - california roll , ewww gross ."
you could really taste that fresh dill .
beignets with vanilla marscapone and homemade jelly ?
plus you ca n't beat pitchers of dos equis !
love the chicken flavor .
"if you like tart apples , you will enjoy !"
went for lunch with the hubby .
this is just cool !
the staff here are great !
i wished the portion was bigger .
great for the 00 - 00 <UNK> .
we will definitely be back when were in town
"fried chicken , big meaty pieces ."
"i requested <UNK> fluids , which were very overpriced ."
got a very small salad on the side .
i went to this location and worked with david .
we found something for everyone and stuffed ourselves stupid .
which were ok tasting but not what we ordered .
will go again when back in <UNK> ...
and we will not be back .
the chairs here were super uncomfortable .
we will definitely be back !
their garlic fries are amazing .
this was a good burger in my book .
the meats and cheeses were fabulous !
the staff is always nice .
steak temperatures on point .
my favorite is the big rig pasta .
it was just as good as lunch !
i moved here from colorado .
it ' s the perfect combination .
"they , of course , loved this place ."
i am never disappointed with the burgers here .
a little taste of home !
it was clean and the bed was comfortable .
i will be back .
never seen anything like it .
i apologize i did not get her name .
they definitely could use some different stores .
- rrb - not for me .
the hotel cafe has a bit to be desired .
i love the jalapeno bacon and the kobe burger .
"creamy , simple goodness ."
"now , i wo n't go anywhere else !"
what a great find !
would n't go back .
the food was really not that good .
i always have a great time here !
last time was yellow curry with shrimp ... delicious !
"bone in filet , omg ."
everything laid out nicely .
i ordered the creme brulee .
i remember their lobster was mainly just stuffing !
we look forward to being regulars !
i like that they allow re-entry .
our server was absolutely perfect !
service and ambiance pretty good .
the employees were nice .
the prices are very reasonable .
:d i ate here for dinner tonight .
two stars since it was fast and efficient .
great for a late night snack .
the steak and lobster is perfectly seasoned .
move it somewhere else .

my entire stay was flawless .
poor management and extremely poor customer service !
"og , stop changing out good menu items ."
and they are all well seasoned and tasty .
we ca n't wait to return .
everyone is very nice .
all on top of an egg bun .
the menu is huge and offers something for everyone .
i have heard mixed reviews from friends .
it was definitely a great conversation to start with .
we wanted to stay somewhere different .
it ' s ten days late .
the restaurant is great and the service was impeccable .
this was a super cool place .

it was pretty good .
pizza = to die for .
will absolutely come back again !
love the pastrami sandwich .
"really , no that great ."
first time and last time .

he hardly ever came to check on our table .
"happy hour specials were great , too ."
the food was delicious and the employees nice .
super local - great tacos & margaritas .
the potatoes were <UNK> !
popped over for appetizers and had a few drinks .
i ' ll be back !
"also , their food is amazing ."
the food is always delish and on point .
also the avocado fries .
and the food was just ok too .
very unique and very tasty !
drinks : drinks are alright .
you may have to ask for this beauty .
it ' s well seasoned .
we can see why !
all for only 00 bucks !
my belly hurt after eating here .
djs ordinarily play hip-hop and dance music .
the instructors are very knowledgeable and helpful !
this place was a huge disappointment .
i definitely did n't want to smell like that .
doc is extremely knowledgeable .
we had a <UNK> pizza appetizer that was delicious !
almost like you are bothering them to show up .
the lentil soup was velvety smooth and seasoned perfectly .
wonderful experience highly recommend this store and kris .
"this last experience , however , was not good ."
i have been coming here many years .
"i said , ` really ?"
i could seriously not believe it .
i ca n't even describe it .
for $ 0.00 each .
i let them know this .
our room smelled of cigarette smoke all weekend !
dr . <UNK> and the staff are amazing .
linens were exceedingly thin .
anyway ... we get to the room .
incidentals charge is excessive for the quality .
what happened to the customer is always right ?
it was all pretty decent .
got the truffled egg sandwich and it was delish .
i would definitely order this again .
i could n't even finish my meal .
i moved to phoenix over 00 years ago .

i would absolutely go back .
every night i fell right to sleep .
' ' i absolutely love the food here !

bruce and his staff are amazing and incredibly talented .
i wish i could be here every day !
trucks were so close to each other .
everyone should know about this place !
i liked the beans but the hashbrowns were ok .
the bread is fantastic and so are the pastries .

it was extremely over priced .
the free ice cream did n't hurt either skip .
my husband was in heaven here .
i love this hotel .
looking forward to many trips back !
how can you say no ?
satay trio was so so - very plain .
and you know what ?
the <UNK> restaurant is good !
i paid $ 00.00 including tip .
this is a special treat to ourselves .
just go to the strip and then walk north .
these were just right and were homemade and fresh .
"thanks doc , see ya next year !"
no buyers remorse here excellent service .
i ai n't lying !
it was an italian food lover ' s dream .

they all used someone else and were pleased .
great place to bring a book and just read !
the sushi was pretty good too but nothing amazing .
i was visibly upset and crying .
the lamps did n't work .
this location has yet to get it right .

"overall , it was an average experience ."
' ' them : ` ` oh !
i just got my car serviced there .

it was some sort of white fish .
the nachos were huge they were pretty good .
plus the pork belly bowl !

will return if i crave this region food .
"yes , there will be other stops ."

"good prices , coupon cards , friendly people"

she was very sweet and attentive .
this could be my new favorite restaurant .
check-in so you can get the complimentary edamame !
"had we known , we would have shared it ."
"apps : great chips and salsa , spicy !"
they have a big wine list .
"ellis island , you are dead to me !"
had excellent service tonight from jose and tim .
i saw other items being delivered that looked great .
just be prepared for possible long waits !
i really enjoy this place .
just goes to show every dog has its day .
the service was just awful .
"i know , you ' re thinking ."
i like the communal tables .
lots of cute <UNK> items like stationary and chocolates .
does n't even look appetizing !
"awful service , awful experience ."
i would definitely return for the shrimp .
garlic fries = inedible .
who does n't love a good brownie ?
service was great and i really enjoyed the food .
would i go back ?
love is almost an understatement .
there ' s shuffle board - yes !
it tasted like cloves and bad fish .
i was very impressed .
the focus is on green natural and organic .
so it was self <UNK> .
do n't forget your quarters .
try it out if you ' re in vegas !
by 0:00 we has received our main course .
we waited nearly 0 hours for our food .
we got to cooking our food .
there was nothing spicy about the sauce .
the pool area looked inviting .
"if you want , you can buy my juicer ."
we had a reservation at <UNK> on saturday night .
this place is awful !
i ' ll take it !
it tasted like a key lime pie .
- service was impeccable .
". and if you are local , they deliver !"
six pieces for about $ 0.00 .
construction noise in lobby very loud .
i noticed every customer coming in was treated well .
what i received was anything but !
mattress factory was that sort of place .
first look we saw soiled tables .
everything tasted stale and cold .
a must visit if in vegas !
"everything we had , we would order again ."
"we ' ll be back , probably fairly regularly ."
great deal and cool atmosphere !
this was my second time at 0000 mexican grill .
the fish was delicious and the chips were okay .
i went with the traditional eggs benedict .
i really really like the atmosphere here .
this is my favorite restaurant of all time .
i am definitely going back there .
i was freaking crazy about the horchata though !
it always introduces me to something new .
their smoothies are just awesome !
i liked my <UNK> enough to have two !
at any ethiopian restaurant .
the drinks are sublime .
not worth what i paid for .
on the up side though the service was great !
my kids loved the grilled cheese and quesadilla .
truly enjoyed my stay here .
all parking is free now .
women like that should not be servers
"less haste , more pleasure !"
<UNK> is a true gift to las vegas !
i ' m so glad we went .
which wich has 00 different options for your sandwich !
"ordered them well done , crispy ."
its worth the wait though !
really and her attitude was the worst .
"so far , so good ."
ask for a side of their tangy pickle juice .
have to agree with other reviewers .
the wedding cake was amazing .
and this leaves the quail ... omg the quail !
she was in a suite by the elevators .
we would definitely spend over $ 00 total .
"loved our table , perfect ."
i also love love love the squash soup .
a small amount of outdoor seating .
i will definitely be coming here more often .
absolutely nothing to write home about here .
"apparently , they ' re almost all on rainbow ."
sometimes my mom and i even split it .
"so , i just ignored it ."
the 0 bedroom suite was roomy .
the taste was a tad disappointing though .
i <UNK> wish they had garlic tots again !
"i felt crunched , too small ."
we had n't eaten so menu .
they are so friendly and nice .
"tons of crushed garlic , too !"
service is really good .
we visited one restaurant there for breakfast .

i ordered their shepherds pie and was n't impressed .
<UNK> is an italian chocolate and <UNK> candy .

my therapist was so nice and caring .
i love this place !
"on my sandwich , the brie was nicely melted ."

"a special thanks to our server , <UNK> ."
i want another one now .
then our crepes came out .
and all in all i had a good experience .
the staff was super friendly .
something about them just ... <UNK> me out .
we also had great customer service with every visit .
the ikea store can be overwhelming .
the design was sooo amazing .
"horrible customer service , no accommodations ."
order the caprese to share .
' ' twice i was pleasantly surprised .
"i could n't help myself yelpers , i laughed ."
it was a very clean restaurant .
i would give this 0 star if i could .
i would definitely come back !
the service was also very efficient and friendly .
and that was that !
warning : the portions are ginormous !
' ' maybe the other location has those ?
butter believe it was my fav .
they had about 0 different flavors .
the bread was soft and contents were fresh !
it cuts out frequently .
i ' m still disappointed .
it smells like a spa and is just beautiful .
you could barely get through the crowd .
the filling itself was very mediocre .
i was not crazy at the portable <UNK> .
one gentleman asked to speak to her supervisor .
i love love love this place .
it was pretty rad !
next up was mussels .
wo n't ever order from here again
the bread is such a great perk !
i recommend going on for happy hour .
another plus for the place - groupon !
so we didnt let it ruin on brunch .
not that i ' m complaining .
dessert is a must in a cafeteria trip !
get there before 0pm for dinner !
"verdict , the garlic tuna was disgusting ."
it is so amazing !
intentionally left without leaving a tip .
it was inexpensive too !
"nom , nom , nom !"
our food was obviously of very low quality .
kids menu is great .
food was great as well !
"my favorite salmon , pineapples and rice ."
"suffice to say , they were delish ."
on 0 separate visits !
we had the lunch buffet for $ 00 .
- lrb - did i leave anything out ?
you could have gone shopping earlier .
do n't believe its name in chinese .
"all in the name of research , people !"
at first glance this park looks great !
not our idea of a romantic date night .
would n't object to returning .
the bread was perfect !
"it was a smaller cut , 0oz ."
everyone in my party thoroughly enjoyed the show !
will definitely stay here again !
they did n't even toast it .
both were served with fries which were yummy .
the spinach side dish is yummy as well .
great tikki masala too .
the mac & cheese is delicious !
bartenders are awesome and super friendly .
the bar area was dirty .
it took my breath away !
both were just okay .
thanks to all you guys !
party city ' s where i go .
"high energy , lots of talent ."
five stars and a yum yum yum !
intrigued by the abe <UNK> flatbread .
this was a really interesting adventure .
the middle was hard and outside was soggy .
"sadly , it went downhill from there ."
do n't go here !
it was chopped cabbage with a vinaigrette .
the bouncers were amazing and super helpful .
would i come back to this wine bar ?
nothing special and i would not go back .
probably wo n't be back .
i was impressed with the selection .
i could hardly tell she was touching my feet .
"sounds crazy , but it does n't taste sweet ."
enjoyed our stay here .
started out with the vegetable tempura .
they were banging and <UNK> away .
the kid and i were starving .
first time - went here to drink .
this pub was so much fun .
anyone with a food allergy / intolerance can relate .
we had our carpets cleaned by ran 0 today .
cons : waited 00 minutes on our food .
"also , they were n't comfortable ."
this was the last wash from a groupon .
i felt the need to update my review .
place was pretty messy too .
sketchy people drink here .

"but seriously , worth the walk ."
it was love at first taste !

the batter they used was delicious .
we walked in and the inside is pretty dated .
"seedy , walk-up window serving up frozen custard !"
a little piece of heaven on earth .
no complaints from her .
and it was n't too badly priced
both were <UNK> delicious .
no a classy venue .
"we also got drinks , regular and pomegranate margaritas ."
minus 0.0 for the price .

she seemed to be working the hardest .

and i hope he gives the other employees lessons !

"yea , my wallet seriously hates me now ."
i find that it hits the spot .

my husband was very impressed with the eggs benedict .

the restaurant is small like 0 booths maybe .
"however , i did enjoy my meal ."
i loved every single act .
this was a great lunch !

i guess they do n't want my business ?
i was in heaven with my red diablo bowl .
guacamole is watery and chips are stale .
soft shell crab is the best ever !
huge tv in the living room and bedroom .
one word of caution for vegetarians .
the food was greater than i expected !

i am a very pleased customer .
there ' s really nothing special in my eyes .
"fries were mediocre , too ."
"i love it , it ' s beautiful !"
we waited over an hour for our food .
we never saw him again .
the service was fast and friendly .
but he thought my food was much spicier !

suprised to find an egg sandwich on the menu .
he says there is no need to change it .
"our server , jessica , was amazing !"
i really enjoyed our dinner here !

lots of toasting and laughing .
i waited to write this because i was upset .
my companion ordered a variety of sushi and rolls .
the bread and temperature was right on point .
it was all so delightful .
i have never seen a more beautiful nightclub .
even thinking about this is making me crave it .
my favorite dish here is the panang curry .
just a bad experience all around .
wow these things are big and totally worth it .
' ' this could n't have been more true .
vey good sense of humor !
as for the pool itself ... eh .
friday my husband calls .
from beginning to end the service was extremely slow .
you really have to search .
but not just any red mango .
by far the perfect place for date night .
the sandwhich combinations are n't the best .
we love bringing out of towners to firefly !
would love for them to create more specialty rolls .
i ' ll definitely be back .
truly delicious food / drinks and <UNK> atmosphere !

we ordered our drinks and an appetizer .
i can see why its so highly rated !
"finally , my hot water came ."
i did n't get sick !

the ambience is lovely and magical .
the pretzel & cheese appetizer is a must !
the salads and appetizers are always up to par .
which was rather annoying .
the food here was delicious !
this one is n't worth the time nor money .
there is not even an explanation of the fees .
the burger was fine ... just fine .
just as good as the first time - amazing !
i can not recommend them enough .
will definitely be back !
you wo n't find any <UNK> in this bar .
my husband and i love this place .

the other one is pickled pearl onions .
not even worth complaining about .
be <UNK> and dress up a little .
my friend really liked the <UNK> cloud !
huge selection of food .

that sounds like a great deal .
it reminds me of having a apple <UNK> .
our server was so hilarious !

the rooms are fairly spacious .
it was really good food .

so i trusted fellow yelpers and hopped over here .
it was too liquidy .
this place is so great !
"so yes , eight tv ' s people !"
"instead , it was more like a side dish ."
"nothing standout , but not awful ."
it took forever to get the bill .
i enjoy their huge variety of sauces too .
"this time , there was a band playing ."
what was older looking new again !
the food is always great .
"thankfully , they did with no questions asked ."
my favorites on the menu ?
i ' m sure it was something minor .

' ' - shrimp summer rolls .
it was amazing - a party in my mouth .
this is another one of my type of places .
do n't even bother to go in the store .
"no complaints , thanks !"
the banana pie was delish !
the waiters more or less left her alone .
the seafood here is delicious .
our server was preoccupied with her cell phone texting .
i sit down at an extremely dirty table .
"anyway , it was poor customer service here ."
completely with the money !
let me just tell you that .
huge selection of frames .
all in all very pleased with our night !
good luck and let us know what you think !
the servers were super attentive and friendly .
so - cheeseburger to the rescue !
happy hour margs are a good price .

just ridiculous how amazing everything tastes .
the conference rooms were huge and always clean .
if you can come during the day .

we both slurp out of the same bowl .
<UNK> is now one of our local favorites !
thanks a lot personality plus !
i had the irish nachos with chicken .
the restaurant itself is bright and airy .
go to the <UNK> instead .
long 0 hour wait and rude disrespectful miserable staff .
"go see <UNK> , she rocks !"
i loved every second of it .
bigger than a restaurant portion .
i ' ve always enjoyed eating at kabuki .
its a 0.0 rating for me .
will definitely do business here again !
way to go being so patient !
no bottled water in the catering service ?
his sandwich was butchered grilled chicken .
we ' ve come here a few times .
not a bad seat in the house .
now if only they would stay in dormont .
and it was delicious .
"she said well , i do n't have it ."
+ very easy to call and make an appointment .
fan of soup and flavorful food .
"the <UNK> , <UNK> & <UNK> were particularly delightful ."
the restaurant was empty when we came .
my daughter had her nails done for $ 0 .
i would definately stay here again .
the waterfall area is nice to chill by .
the facility was clean and had nice restrooms .
words will not suffice here .
i snacks were cookies made of banana and yogurt .
"no complaints whatsoever , definitely would recommend it !"
they were tasteless and the toppings were blah .
i was n't to impressed with the menu .
super friendly and helped with every question we had .
i ordered a catfish po boy sandwich .
be prepared to wait a while .
"mouth-watering , delicious and worth every penny !"
- rrb - fast & friendly .
00 minutes after we ordered .

i was angry but agreed to it .
she literally did not check on us once .
beautiful rooms and accommodations .
all was very tasty !
i guarantee you will keep coming back !
staff is rude and i wo n't be back .
and the sauce - oh the sauce !
my husband ordered belgian <UNK> short rib .
"other than that , this place is great !"
i shocked by the speedy response !
the portion was surprisingly big and filling .
the spring rolls were made with iceberg lettuce ?
love the side sauce .
we had the cheese for desert as well !
but this time was the worst service ever !
' ' ... right in front of our daughter .
vegas needs more old-school .
and the cuts were horrible .
. so the food is always different .
the ranch was also fantastic .
cons : service is hit or miss .
hard to know why .
i really wanted to like this place .
i can not believe this .
he ' s such an entertainer .
been here twice and both times were nice .
i do n't plan <UNK> that location again .
i would definitely recommend this awesome place .
everyone working there is super friendly .

i will start out with the food is good .
"love the retail employees , super nice and accommodating ."
would visit here again !
the restaurant itself is spacious and nice .
we dont get out much alone without the toddler .
love their <UNK> and fried okra !
he was incredibly condescending .
. but it may just be my personal taste .
ate here for breakfast while staying at caesars .
great wine list but very overwhelming .
getting an appointment is easy - you walk in .
they will make it right in front of you !
i even got <UNK> there !
their desserts and bread basket are great .
i am a customer .
which i managed so mission accomplished !
"i swear , the food just would n't end !"
the goat curry and chicken curry are my favorite !
my son was dying to try it .
"it was good , but not great ."
the food is decent .
i am over the moon about craft opening !
i cant wait to go back and try items .
great experience and knowledgeable staff !
definitely a good atmosphere .
the steak and shrimp were just ok .
others should opt for mcdonalds .
they wont get it until friday .
i choose the carnegie cucumber .
i liked it better with the rice .
i ' m pretty disappointed .
that ' s how delicious it was .
my boyfriend loves the soft tacos here .
"he is kind , caring , and thoughtful ."
finally an authorized apple service on the east side !
the driver was really nice .
pass me some hummus !
i ' ll never eat there again .
would use no other tree service .
"second , the owner is super nice ."
he looked at me like really .
"' ' <UNK> , she had serious issues !"
"and , you can call your order in ."
nobu better watch his back !
staff was very attentive and polite .
it was really good value too .
only half & half .
the salad was extraordinarily overdressed with a balsamic dressing .
take out is also convenient !
i would go back just to explore .
their sushi rolls looked really good too !
this guy was not gentle .
"oh well , more elbow room for us !"
"single ladies , listen up ."
its cute and clever .
plenty of variety the on the buffet .
definitely worth a try if you like thai food .
this park is amazing !
it is fat kid heaven .
"to die for , i ' m telling you ."
service was super slow ... .
definitely the topper of the night .
it was still very good .
we both got <UNK> which were just a ok .
and the service was great too !
i ate the entire portion .
i think i ' m in love .
people are working out .
"pretty pricey , will not be returning ."
i also really loved the blt !
the eggrolls are always on point !
samantha is such an amazing team member .
we originally went just to use a gift card .
such a friendly staff !
we made the perfect choice .
i was n't a fan of the stuffed oysters .
"all in all , a pretty good chinese buffet !"
we will be back !
"tragic , i know ."
apparently he had not even been told what happened .
so simple and oh so good .
she <UNK> and stood there with her mouth open .
the food is sometimes bland and sometimes ok .
there was a choice of creamy or straight horseradish .
i was pleasantly surprised at my meal here .
i will come back again .
the wait staff was very nice and efficient .
"they were huge , delicious and showed up quickly ."

beautiful restaurant with great food .
their obstacle race training program is outstanding !
entertainment irish music always fun .
brought my parents here to eat and left embarrassed .
"they were busy , but found that annoying ."
ca n't wait to come back !
and then i left .
but it satisfied something at the moment .
when my food arrived it was not correct .
my new east side fave !
my only real downfall here is the parking situation .
"always clean , always fresh ."
definitely try the horchata and carne asada tacos !
i really wanted to like this place !
total waste of my money .
spouse said she would just eat it .
super comfy with tons of pillows .
not a wonderful first impression .
i really enjoyed the bread .
her patience with my little guy was so amazing .
it ' s got it all .
would definitely recommend them to all .
- - access to amenities .
"when you walk in , it ' s dark ."
"chino bandido , you are so good ... ."
others at my table enjoyed their food as well .
the food was good but kind of expensive .
outdoor seating in the summer is very nice .
"if i could give 0.0 stars , i would ."
my <UNK> nelson experience is always so pleasant .
"also , save room for dessert ."
i ca n't remember what everyone else got .
my dining companion got the chicken tequila fettucini .
the fajitas was over the top .
what a joke of an establishment .
no need for reservations .
"come on now , help them out !"
the dishes were simple and tasted freshly made .
our ankles appreciate it .
i will be lookin for another company .
better planning on my part next time i guess .
i ca n't wait to come back !
the services is also great too .
i was slightly disappointed with the limited wine list .
"however , reservoir was nothing like what i expected !"
not the fanciest but definitely not circus circus either .
everything we tried was not good at all .
"hotel is beautiful , smaller , excellent service ."
it was flavorful and juicy .
the verde salsa is yummy .
we enjoyed checking out cave creek that was flowing .
i am a fan !
so we obviously got in no problem .
baked brie in a <UNK> ?
"no , just no ."
the host was so funny .
other flavors i ' ve tried .
definitely have had better .
the yogurt is grade c quality .
food was amazing - lrb - <UNK> crab legs !
the meal was absolutely wonderful .
plus i never heard back about those pictures .
"my instinct told me no , but whatever ."
the washrooms are clean and located downstairs .
that ' s a little dramatic .
my favorite club in vegas hands down !
- rrb - is to die .
you ' ll have your own list soon enough !
i have a coach purse .
yea that is right ... a cocktail bar .
i always get smiles + delicious burritos .
no wait to get drinks filled up .

they gave me half a <UNK> of dijon .
currently one of my favorite spots !
0nd best sandwich i ' ve ever had !
tryst omelette was amazing !
enchilada and sauce were perfect .
- - loaded chicken nachos are a must try !
oh and the wet salon products smelled gross .
"yes , yes , and yes ."
she did my top <UNK> and eyebrows .
the tub & pillows are nice though .
they were all there in the waiting room .
the fish tacos were delish !
the decor is minimal and simplistic .
"the service is wonderful , great shopping experience ."
so good we ate here twice during our trip .
she never came back to refill anything .
such a cute thai restaurant .
"poor business ethics , will never return ."
the neighborhood was kinda shady looking though .
i saw indians who were eating here .
' ' ` ` are you mad ?
i was distraught without my oreos .
"okay , fine - we will deal with it ."
the atmosphere was pleasant and refreshing .
. they ' re the best !
you know how that goes .
i love this place .

i would have been lost without him !
"and always , always skip the chicken ."
i <UNK> went in today and was very disapointed .
"i got the steak and scallop hibachi , wonderful !"
i think after yesterday i made my last visit .
greats meats for the kids lunches !
i got the worst food poisoning of my life .

the performance was stunning .
"even better , the service was top-notch ."
gravy had great flavor .

i love the amount of resources here .
i found this was strange .
"overall , we did not appreciate being rushed ."
this place was ok !
our server was attentive but not overbearing .
the service was also great very attentive .
this pasta is n't something we would recommend .
the hollandaise was grainy .
i loved the store instantly .
it comes with free breakfast .
also unsweetened apricot iced tea .
service is great and friendly .
i was shockingly and pleasantly surprised .
do n't go hungry !
we ended up at society cafe .
had a very homey atmosphere .
total bill ... just under $ 00.00 .
i got the expresso one .
you can tell by who comes here .
it was also fabulous !
and my card will still be charged .
"first of all , it was huge ."
well let me continue with my dissatisfaction .
we came here our first morning in vegas .
we ordered waited one hour pizza never came .
i love zuzu & the hotel valley ho !
i added mushrooms to it .
oh thank heaven indeed !

i ' m so glad we did .
it has crushed oreos all over it !
the sound of those <UNK> machines are amazing !
i love this place .
"which was smoked salmon , cream cheese and chives !"
i love that everything is family style .
salespeople are extremely friendly & not pushy .
each course served got better than the last !
the lettuce was watery .
"no hello , no name , no welcome ."
wo n't be going back .
the portions here are huge !
this was a recommendation from my sister .
we were celebrating a couple of special occasions .
they make my children feel so comfortable !
bacon is peppered and amazing .
dr . <UNK> had a wonderful bedside manner .
salads at lunch are pretty spot on too .
we love sambalatte but tonight was depressing .
we chose the downstairs section .
we stop here on our way from the airport .
not a single item we ordered tasted good .
it was so good .
fun experience and atmosphere .
"ok , that eased my mind a bit ."
but your patience will be rewarded .
by far my favorite location .
decor was quite striking .
our food was just incredible .
they were doughy and bland .
i would n't recommend this place at all .
and the bread ... oh the bread !
i ' m so grateful i found them .
the server then approached us with menus .
chompie ' s is delicious .
service was decent and friendly .
i ' d go back for another grilled cheese !
it was everything i wanted it to be .
they will clear your trays when you are done .
also the kitchen is completely open !
"no cover , and no tables either ."
i went once and had so much fun .
great drinks and the staff is amazing and personable !
had brunch here last week .
"all in all , money not well spent ."
there was a hair in the korean pancake .
the shower head was also a bit iffy .
at about . 00 cents an ounce .
i will always go to this ace .
this place is absolutely gorgeous .
"- rrb - , we headed to the room ."
. people get in and out .
had fun dancing though .
best milkshakes of my life !
also the salad is n't great .
sorry spinatos you made a huge mistake .

"at this point , we are contemplating leaving ."
- spicy tuna roll - so delish !
this dinner was so incredibly messy it was annoying .
"in fact , i was kinda scared ."
i felt like the audience was miles away .
"filled with shrimp , topped with melting cheese ."
vin master is your stop !
food and service was amazing ! ! highly recommend .
this place is a foodie ' s wet dream .
he went above and beyond my expectation .
extremely hard but lots of fun .
"not into driving , but still want a thrill ?"
he did a few tricks nothing special .
i wo n't be going back .
the pastry unfortunately was downright gross .
i ' m definitely a fan !
the next time you ask ?
it was soooo delicious .
and we loved the slide at the pool .
it is a true locals joint .
"like , love , love , love them ."
that night we were both sick !
wonderful atmosphere to study and meet with friends .
how do i even begin to describe this place .
dunno who <UNK> is ?
the jasmine rice had excellent flavor .
it wo n't be very long .
"i ' m lame , i know ."
"for now , i say goodbye ."
thank you for taking care of my tahoe .
absolutely fresh and flavorful .
i just took the food home to eat !
little pricey but sooo worth it .
i tried many out and they were all good .
when you have it with french fries !
love the atmosphere and food was delicious !
he did a great job and was super professional .
so friendly and knowledgable .
almost looks like a crepe .
"they were , um , kind of weird ."
i ' m very impressed !
but we ' ll be back !
"anyways , we kept to the first floor ."
i have n't been here in years .
"i had the drunken tacos , they were delicious !"
the scenery was beautiful this morning .
this is the best urgent care !

i am <UNK> about them right now .
. even if i craved boba past midnight .
we pay $ 0 for a beer .
"unfortunately , the place is always crowded ."
i love this place .
"give them a try , i dare you !"
this place is absolutely delicious .
i was back in the office within 0 minutes .
that ' s my opinion .
"oh great , now i want another picnic salad !"
i wish i could dual rate .
hubby said the sangria was fantastic .
eating on swings = awesome !
i will definitely go back here .
his prices are extremely reasonable .
he ' s also the owner of the chapel .
"other than that , overall pretty good viet food ."
what a beautiful trip we had .
it was huge and the flavor was perfect !
it ' s high energy .
love the fat fries and onion rings too .
went tonight for dinner and thought it was great !
neither of us loved the kiki .
a good way to start your vacation .
my husband and i had a wonderful stay .
i asked about the lemonade part .
and the adobo fried rice omelet was bomb !
gorgeous exterior and lovely interior .
our server was awesome .
lots of different water experiences .
. soft chocolate chip with sea salt on top .
the broccolini was sheer heaven .
the drinks are stiff !
not the experience we expected .
"go early , go often ."
yelp did me right .
this place will be packed in no time .
we immediately called that number to complain .
"cozy place , nicely decorated ."
my son had the same thing and definitely agreed .
aside from this it was pretty average .
they also have <UNK> you can use .
<UNK> : i have the order here .
"this occurred not once , but twice ."
my nephew reserved a racquetball court .
my friends had the grilled salmon and pasta .
we left the table full .
the drinks were also fabulous !
chicken katsu curry and salt and pepper pork chop .
i really like it .
"the chai latte was good , but no wifi ?"
like pt ' s but better .
do n't know about the secret menu ?
not too shabby at all .
"man , they look so good ."
i asked about fluid checks and <UNK> .
tacky and no thought put into the bedroom .
be sure to try the <UNK> peanut butter martini .
so tight and confusing !
- the number of toppings .
oh my ... perfect crust and filling .
the powder lingers on your tongue .
i ca n't pick which i preferred more .
. they are open late and service is great .
they remodeled their entire restaurant .
the sashimi tastes <UNK> at all .
there were awards everywhere raving about the cuisine there .
"not <UNK> , but freshly made ."
love their fried okra !
but trust me : go inside .

- rrb - were the utensils !
had the grilled cheese burger with waffle fries .
i rather try the other plates .
"tonight , about 0:00 pm , we tried again ."
i would highly recommend this company .

casual with indoor and outdoor seating .
two sips and straight to the trash .
and i have had real gelato before .

the veggie lasagna also does n't disappoint .
"i order a mojito , good flavor ."
i wanted to love this place i really did .
a cute little cafe with decent food .
what the heck is up with that ?

the staff is not all friendly .
"i chose the buffalo , which i loved ."
i enjoy dancing and getting dolled up .

- rrb - and he kept it very classy .
everyone is super friendly and pretty quick .

too bad the food did not match the atmosphere .
the food is of terrible quality .

the black sesame came with condensed milk and mochi .

we asked for syrup and honey mustard .
how can that be ?
if i could give it a 0.0 i would .
and the prices very reasonable .
nothing to look at though .

"beef wellington - omg , it was good ."
one star warranted because 0 .
"in addition , our service was excellent ."
they offer gluten-free buns as well .
he was super nice and felt horrible .
and for the price ? ! amazing !
the people working and the management are so disrespectful !
it still was the same ambiance .

grade f for service and understanding
maybe i just caught them on an off day ?

it melts in your mouth !
make this a priority to go to !
this rating is based purely on drinks .

finally we shared the fish tacos .
the food was great !
you have great energy .
this store is awesome .
but it was worth it !
so glad we did not .
we ' ll be back !
save your money and go next door to tonic !
i opted for the half sandwich and half salad .
both inside and outside .
we had 0 entrees and the rest tapas .
this hotel is very swanky !
perfect for reading or visiting with friends .
got us into see the doctor very quickly .
my salad then arrived .
a little watery for my taste .
i have always had good service .
a little frantic but the food was good .
but everything i have had here was awesome .
this is ideal for a bachelor or bachelorette party .
it ' s a definite go .
the dishes are small and lack flavor .
definitely recommend visiting the daily bread bistro !
we could not have made a better choice !
the last was in the sink area .
we won in vegas !
definitely made the dining experience more comfortable & pleasurable .
big selection of different teas - definitely worth trying !
i asked to have old bonding removed .
we were greeted and sat on the patio .
we got zero rest staying here .
i would definitely recommend this place .
"also , amazing waiters !"

not bad at all .
i tend to lean towards the eel personally .

no way is this place 0 stars .
i have filed with maricopa health department .
i ' ll be back !
charming inside cafe with few tables and homey atmosphere .
definitely recommend this place !
we waited awhile for our food .
i almost threw up !
"and the ` ` oh , nice !"
"i really liked the music , rock / alternative ."
"eh , not a <UNK> ."
we had such a blast !
the prices were right .
this is a <UNK> store .
we sat down figuring we had to be next .
love the staff and service here !
yeah ... they were n't grilled .
we were very dissatisfied with this dance studio .
i ' m very impressed .
everything was so fresh and delicious .
i would definitely go back to monty ' s
the baristas cheerfully made my new request .
i always order the same thing .
some servers are just not all there .
definitely would go back to try the sushi .
we will be back .
"it had been lightly steamed , at least ."
i honestly do n't have a problem with that .
the menu says that jackfruit tastes like artichoke hearts .
tiny old home downtown with tons of character .
all the little nick <UNK> .
he just said ` ` $ 00 ' ' .
i have always loved that idea .
the pool was nice .
"everyone there is so friendly , especially the owner ."
love it always smells so good in there .

it warms the <UNK> of my heart !
just be careful with your credit card here .
they were the perfect combination of squishy and firm .
i got a very quick ` ` no .
patty has been amazing with our dog <UNK> !
there were a couple little hiccups though .
we did n't because of our very large group .
lacking in flavor though .
we ordered a pizza and their chicken and waffles .
the hh menu is sparse .
it should have had <UNK> .
this is really odd to me !
it matches my engagement ring perfectly !
i would visit again and try something else .
she was extremely rude !
honestly something anyone in town should see .
' ' every time we go .
"0 stars , every time ."
pay the . 00 for water .
i ' m looking forward to trying this service .
i can show it to you .
have n't even checked in yet and why ?
the appetizer was just okay .
i had a great time when i came .
cheap happy hour and cheap food specials .
fresh garlic and mushrooms .
sundance is a pretty close second though .
customer service is awful .
"overall , the best teriyaki bowl in the area !"
the salad dressing was horrible .
"our waitress , jackie , was the best !"
. unfortunately i was too full for any dessert .
happy hour until 0 .
i ca n't even mail order it .
it was like subway but for pizza .
it was very salty .
hotel is tired ... clean but tired .
so here is the food rundown !
the pizza seemed to be too greasy .
had such a great experience !
i split a seafood etouffee .
up next was the salmon eggs benedict .
get this ... when i refuse to upgrade ... .
beds were very comfortable .
i do n't believe anything is deep fried here .
they made unique salsas and sauces .
i ' m confused by all the high ratings .
she definitely need to go thru customer service training .

gluten free meats and sides .
i ' m not different either .
less than stellar choices for a birthday dinner .
i sold my car here this morning !
"oh well , on to the next one right ?"
my bf got the cheesesteak and loved it too .

portion to price is comparable however .
i eat out all the time .
"all in all , the soup was good ."
the bloody mary was crazy !

this location was good .
she has confidence in her work .
. i am sooo getting this next time .
"again , interesting combos but not yummy ."

the food is incredibly delicious .
chipotle takes the cake for me .
the bad : this place is freezing inside .
the pool area was decent .
service was incredibly slow for drinks and dessert .
anything with the filet is pretty great too .

i really got a kick out of watching those !
we highly do n't recommend you guys go there .
as for the drinks ?
i do believe my <UNK> ?
why would i want another one ?
parking is a pain .
maybe a little too much rice .
we were so looking forward to dining with them .
free shuttle to and from airport .
thanks for a wonderful evening !
hmm that does n't seem to make much sense .
i recommend adding spicy mustard and havarti cheese .
it was kind of bland .
all this cold stone crap makes me mad .
i went with ice cold green tea to drink .
i ' m just not a fan .
it literally melted in my mouth !
they were unprofessional and inefficient .
they have a lunch special on the bento boxes .

i also love rebecca .
service is always friendly to boot .
"worth it , but still craving horchata pretty hard ."
"i ordered their eggs benedict , omg so yummy ."
he had a bit of confusion .
it tastes like cabbage drenched in mayo .
"stop in , you wont be disappointed !"
we wanted something different .
we found our server to be pleasant and attentive .
the show was entertaining .
this restaurant = a great experience .
prices start at $ 000 .
i do love having choices !
. it ' s huge ... but .
we are all out-of-towners .
my husband and i love eating here !
atleast in the eyes of this establishment .
the fries were good too .

dr . johns and his staff are wonderful !
our server was snobby .

i loved the pastry dough on the outside .
not a good selection of food .
i will never go there again .

. grimaldi ' s in chandler .
below the tower was harissa sesame sauce .

their prices truly ca n't be beat !
we will be back because the price was fair

i will for sure be coming back !

locals would n't particularly come here .
"did she have to pee , perhaps ?"
it was a great time !
we decided to order different drinks .
you really get your monies worth for $ 0 .
not one ounce of warmth .
i am obsessed with the pineapple chicken fried rice !
we do n't ask for additional towels .
their burgers are always fresh along with everything else .
and the karaoke is just incredible !
the other restaurants they have are 000 % better .
you probably wo n't like fashion square mall !
but my friend liked it .
i was dumbfounded at how bad the meal was .
the food was absolutely disgusting .
i adore the pupusas at this restaurant .
i really hope they read these reviews .
we will be back .
talk about a great way to spend an evening !
it was quite shocking .
the salads are delicious and come in gigantic quantities .

it scratched that craving for the night .
this particular day i felt especially rushed .
the oysters were huge !
best dentist i ' ve ever seen !
now it ' s all modern looking .
it smelled fishy and was too thick .

but i was really disappointed in the food .
. way tooo <UNK> !
ordered the margherita pizza and chopped salad .
' ' it was us .
i had the chicken & waffle sandwich .
at least we got apologies ?
"sorry it seriously bugs me , obviously !"
i had a very different experience here .
it ' s a little pricey .
"simple , but delicious !"
and it ' s super reasonable !
makes you feel relaxed as you enter .
the restaurant itself was beautifully decorated .
ca n't wait to go back .
and half off for hh .
what a great find !
hopefully we just caught them on a bad night .
it was a good summer salad .
the service is quick and friendly .

i really liked the collard greens .
last time we got the southern hospitality .
what ' s next you say ?
"overall , i would highly recommend this place ."
we were extremely disappointed in the service here .
this place has the worst service .
grounds around the buildings are maintained and always clean .
a + it is still the original flavor .
we both ordered off the special menu .
they also had a sofa bed too !
the space is very clean with delightful decor .
they also positioned the chairs next to outlets .
"other than that , no ."
i am so disappointed because i expected better .
really an awesome thrift shop to check out .
my coldstone days are over !
the <UNK> goat cheese salad is to die for .
"we waited , and waited , and waited ."
the gym / spa was lovely .
my <UNK> according to <UNK> was $ 00.00 .
the service is pretty ok .

too many other places around with much better food .
i think it would help with the confusion .
thai tea was strong and amazing .

poor customer service and treatment by staff !
"lots of ingredients , lots of flavor ."
"pad kee mao - flat noodle dish , tasty ."
both our plates were around $ 00-00 .
she ended up refunding my entire meal .

the map yelp provides is n't accurate .
with all the reviews listed all are pretty accurate .
you will never find the coffee spot empty .
even the music was awesome !
i love you weiss deli .
i would not recommend this groomer .
<UNK> my sales guy was wonderful and patient !
no one to take the dishes away .
"awesome , awesome , awesome !"
the others in my group thought it was okay .

so not too bad overall .
i may have to make it a regular haunt .
we started off with the poke .
i think back in my college days <UNK> .
i would use him again and recommend him highly .
i guess the service made up for it .

they truly do love locals .
cute bar in the front when you walk in .
its to die for .
just gave me the <UNK> .
. wish we had n't wasted our time .
we tried the fry sampler .
throw another bartender in there !
the green tea is so refreshing and delicious .
fried chicken and waffles !
the apple pie is another delicious treat .

the service was fabulous .
the specials sounded amazing .

the shop was completely empty .
i recommend regular pizza with tomato sauce with basil .

this place is awesome !
fun patio that you can bring your dog to .
i finished my plate without feeling weighed down .

the people here are just so darn nice .

the restaurant is pretty small with maybe 00 tables .
you guys are the best .
way to <UNK> me up brenner !
good lookin ' out for the ladies !
that ' s $ 00 for the 0st hour .
not worth the cab ride from the strip .
it is consistent with fresh veggies and flavorful chicken .

everyone is very friendly and professional .
the fondant decoration was unnecessary and tasteless .
this place is a joke and a hot mess .
i was conflicted when ordering a drink .
again no salt or seasoning .
i do n't think it ' s worth returning !
erik was amazingly friendly and helpful .
be careful about adding fresh fruit on there .
my favorite deli in town .
i had the pad kee mao which was outstanding .
not too salty and just spicy enough !
really just another cvs .
i do n't think they deserve that much credit .
what really got me was my entree !
wo n't be going back .
they enjoyed the kids ' cheese and pepperoni pizza .
my nails look good and the people were nice .
they made sure the margs were constantly flowing .
and when all else fails the burger is <UNK> !
the noodles were kinda pasty .
my friends raved about this place .
"the food was bad , even for a buffet ."
stale bread and brown avocado .
i made more than 0 trips back & forth .

"not spectacular , but still yummy ."
i will be ordering it next time i go .
this location is a bit different .
i loved the sauce on it .
it began getting busy and i can see why .
free mac and cheese if you check in !
"yeah , that ' s fabulous ."
came here with my boyfriend last month for dinner .
very distracting and not something we wanted .
it ' s a great wee cafe !

$ 0 bar bites yes yes yes !
the employees are always friendly and so helpful .

i was hoping we would n't find it .
"great waiters , great ambience , wonderful all around ."
this place is so cute and cool .
but wow were we blown away !
"most of all , the food was wonderful ."
so i appreciated that .
this restaurant is a nice surprise .

and had to charge us dinner prices .
this place have always treated me so well .

there was nothing particularly special about it .

it is decorated very cool and trendy .
i <UNK> n't believe it .
i always pick at least one grilled option .
"their peanut butter lava cake though , <UNK> ."
they have been great !
she just kept brining me things .
"cheap , & bitter ."
it ' s silly - - and frustrating .
do n't order the stromboli .
will be telling people about them for sure .
i was surprised at how large the portion was .
i do n't think you ' ll be disappointed .
the coleslaw on the chicken plate was surprisingly scrumptious .
"also , the bartenders are extremely friendly and nice ."
this area of the strip just feels dead now .
i asked for medium .
i think it is reasonably priced and very fresh .
finally we just left .
why did n't i think of that ?
not what i was expecting .
my son <UNK> the sesame chicken lunch .
i discovered this little gem during a group dinner .
i would totally recommend pizza patron .

we loved the mac n cheese bites .
i would definitely come back for this .
it had the right amount of salt .
servers were nothing but nice .
". i mean , umm ."
looks like this location has cleaned up their act .
it was seriously weird .
the comedians and the dj were hilarious .
"helpful staff , coffee is so good ."
you definitely get your money ' s worth .
they also serve beer & wine .
they have a lot of healthy options .

i have notified their corporate office .
so what was it ?
"so , should n't it be scallop escargot then ?"

both sandwiches knocked our socks off !
. but my friend does .
no <UNK> i could n't !
"also , they have a nice pool ."

"the red beans were sweet , like baked beans ."
my mom really likes this restaurant .
the wait staff are the coolest .

ella makes the most wonderful cappuccinos in the valley !
it ' s an absolute must .
i was booked for the wrong ultra sound .
it was very good and yummy and just right .
drink refills seem to be non-existent .
fried eggs are tasteless .
the sauce was deliciously spicy without being overwhelming .
it was a cool creepy feeling though .
but aside from that ?
service is always great and they are very accommodating .
these were fried and seasoned perfectly .
like jalapeã ± o poppers only sushi !
i can not say enough praise for their menu !
"more than that , his social development has improved ."
he is understanding and compassionate .
that was mainly the <UNK> about our stay here .

we promptly agreed and thanked her for the consideration .
variety of rolls a bit limited on veggie options .
the oysters were pretty fresh as well .
the room had no air conditioning .

the employees are very knowledgeable and friendly .
i accidentally found this little hidden jewel !

the rooms : what can i say ?
this place sounded perfect !

we ordered our jar of drank first .
went for a happy hour and it was dead .
the whole dining experience i could do without .

not just for making salsa anymore !
they were warm and friendly .
they have the best prices !
he pointed me in the direction and left .

i ' ll definitely be back !
duck confit and filet mignon were really good too .

we have been here about ten times .
i ' ve never experienced that consistency before .

this is that kind of place .
the slices are <UNK> !
i highly recommend vintage key !
the bowl of soup is a very generous size .
especially the gluten free sandwich we had ! !
we could not recommend <UNK> more highly !
blue corn pancake and shrimp to start .

"it ' s so close to home , too ."
. which is very cheap .
"this time i ordered the turkey club , cold ."

went in for a drink .
beautiful evening on the <UNK> ' s patio .

ca n't say enough about it .
the service was slow .
the rice had became dry and crunchy !
water in lobby for quest was empty .
get the seafood bouillabaisse .
thank you brooke and michael for everything ! ! !

the drinks are slightly overpriced in my opinion .
i have always been a <UNK> lover !
only sushi place i feel comfortable going to .
oysters were delicious as well !
the food portions were small .
this place is awesome !

$ 00 to be exact !

very fast with the drinks .
the ahi tar tar is bomb too .
entrees : we ordered the filet mignon and lobster .
"thank you , yelp ."
"i saw mainly asians , and wondered why ."

i enjoyed their coffee .
- rrb - and kettle chips .
that will keep me coming back .
"first , the beds were too high ."
she helped me make my selection of frames .
and with the fresh tortillas and fresh guacamole .
every breakfast option comes with breakfast potatoes .
"most importantly , we really enjoyed our meal !"
my friend ordered us a pretty decent salad .
the fries were really good .
"it is pricey , but worth it ."
<UNK> - our starting cocktail smelled like fragrant roses .
unlikely to be coming back to this location .
tasteless interior and expensive drinks .

totally disappointed with that part of things .
"quick , easy , inexpensive , delicious pho ."

they have approximately 00 + flavors to choose .
once i ordered romaine and believe i got iceberg .

"both times , it was not a busy day ."
"all this considered , i would still go here ."
we had cashew shrimp .
my nail technician <UNK> was amazing !
banana muffins are the best .
"nevertheless , i was livid ."
pretty pricey for the quality though .
the fries are so fresh .
veggies were extra and cold .
staying for one night and 0 .
their samosas was amazing !
it was 0 courses for around 00 .
i ' m almost embarrassed to admit that !
another great hilton experience .
- ample toppings of extras .
a bit warmer than i would like inside .
i would order every single dish again .
i highly recommend i clean carpets .
definitely worth going back just for the mussels !
my addiction to <UNK> was born in this gym !
. why only 0 stars ?
i swear i dream about it .
nice and fresh tasting .
". the salads , good ."

the corn queso dip was blah and cold .
their tuna salad is really yummy .
the atmosphere is a little bizarre .

chianti on the verge of vinegar .
this is place really knocked my socks off !
"dry salmon , flavorless ramen , small portions ."
we essentially like italian food when we go out .

my friend also recommends the red bean bread .
love the freshness of this place .
it is definitely simplicity at its finest !
and so are the burgers and fries .
the drinks were okay .
apparently bacon is not cooked to order here .
it looks like bird <UNK> .
the service is friendly and the food is fresh .
this place has no employees !
great fresh thai food !
"slow , disgruntled employees for the most part ."
and those <UNK> cherries .
so much happened right at our eye level .
they also had cotton candy in bags for dessert .
although the candy selection here is much better .
i must ' ve died and gone to heaven !
this one was decent .
they were just as delicious !
"the tanning bed ended up being broken , surprise ."
<UNK> to the rescue !

my husband did n't like his meal .
this was pretty good and one for cheesecake lovers .
"either way , it ' s appreciated ."
they ' re sooooooooo sweet .
the prices are not outrageous and they have wifi .
my personal favorite is the classic cobb salad .
the portion is pretty big .
affordable stayed within budget !
to those who are complaining here ... suckers !
some of the worst service i have ever received .
"on another occasion , i ordered the dip trio ."
"helpful , not pushy at all ."
the owner was so nice !
and super friendly staff !
we will be back for sure !
our mouths are still burning !
it was also cold and hard .
the prices were just like a movie theater .
i recommend sprouts to everyone .
the they started bringing us small pizzas .
"the atmosphere was so peaceful , very zen ."
short rib sliders - came with 0 .
place was clean and welcoming .
i dropped my car off the following monday .
we enjoyed everything about this place .
off white and you can see through it .
do i feel like a corporate chain loving whore ?
husband got food poisoning same night .
six pieces to the order .
you have to try the moon is rising !
such a beautiful park .
"overall , very enticing place to go ."
i got the filet and believe it was 0oz .
i had no complaints .
but i guess everything is expensive in vegas .
the veggies are always fresh !
"love the honey garlic wings , as well ."
"also , i had the heart and seoul burger ."
no flavor at all .
want to pretend to be healthy ?
"' ' anyway , they were both wrong ."
"overall , it was eh at best ."
friendly staff and always leave with a bright smile .
guy behind the counter seemed put off assisting people .
so thanks for your help today john !
the salads were nothing to write home about .
good lunch menu and reasonable .
"the service was better this time , too ."
these guys are so great !
they even let you order grey goose !

this restaurant converted my daughter to a sushi lover .
good size portions & our server was wonderful !
there ' re meat is done to perfection .
"service was fantastic also , especially lisa !"
you just have to try one .

i felt that the rice was a bit bland .
we will be back no doubt !
but the ambiance is what you pay for .
it ended up taking at least 00 minutes .
the food is delicious and authentic taiwan styles .
the pancakes are the star .
i recommend substituting the crusty bread for soft pita .
i liked this much more .
the 00s music was awesome !
they also make you feel super welcome .
been here a million times and everything is delicious !
<UNK> is reminiscent of being back east .
"team waiting , smiling friendly faces ."
prices were very reasonable .
and had to order another .
the quality of food was great !
what a waste of a yelp spot .
it is extremely authentic and absolutely delicious .
"yes , yes , yes ."
even the kids ' meals seem large in portions .
we did n't go into that part .
great date night spot for old town scottsdale .
let ' s just leave it at that .
the best part about my visit was our waitress .
our service with ryan was good .
- their corkage fees are ridiculous .
- rrb - that i remember when it opened .
"cute atmosphere , and deco ."
by far the worst customer service ever !
closer and cheaper then other off strip <UNK>
spicy tuna roll was big and flavorful .
the surf ' n turf was $ 00 .
there is an outdoor patio with an excellent view .

hip decor and very clean !
it never stopped which was nice .
very clean as well .
i had the hangover omelette and it was gigantic !

his friendliness and professionalism made my day !
creamy with lovely flavors .
"love , love this place !"
it ' s sooo good .

so worth the calories .
anna is a be talented teacher .
every entree we saw at the restaurant was huge .

i ' m a huge fan .
overall the experience was mediocre .
this will be the last hotdog you eva crave .

decent at it ' s best .
"otherwise , i ' ll pass ."
servers were friendly and attentive .
it does n't surprise me though .
we ' ll be back .
the tables there are long and are co-ed .
"if you like an ipa , here you go ."
ate here with my parents .
i have had a variety of dishes here .
should i reach across and do it myself ?
you do get the tj feeling in there !
peruvian cuisine is so tasty .
and the the italian dressing was gross .
it is a great place !
they both raved about it etc . .
i believe his name was john .
"all in all , ok ."
it was busy inside .
fantastic and fresh asian fare !
they had so many books !
but this one was nothing to write home about .
such a relaxing trip !
i have wanted to try it for years .
tried this thai restaurant for the first time .

this is a beautiful restaurant .
service could have been better .

the habanero is <UNK> hot but oh so good .
"other than that , a nice night ."
"and , i love the bathroom there ."
"the experience ranged from fantastic , to horrible ."
<UNK> ' s is just ok for me .
i ate half of it and was full .
we walked out of there and he apologized !
best meal i had in vegas .
the onion rings are delicious .
restaurant seems unsure of its identify !
this location had so many employees .

i ca n't find you he says .
the good : no cover .
could spend an entire day there relaxing or partying .
this place is a tea heaven for me !
dr . <UNK> was amazing .
so good i had to order another .
so much better than salt of the earth .
so be prepared for that .

the service here takes forever .
maybe it was because i am a woman ?

i looked online and it had decent reviews .
this place can be busy <UNK> and on weekends .
the service was fine .
the food came out wrong .

the grilled version was dry and over charred .
she stated they are going to be warm .
he finished the work quickly and was completely professional .
all three were <UNK> !
the spicy tuna rolls were really yummy .

now im craving this place like crazy .
it is incredibly relaxing .
i will most definitely stay here again .
they have so many cocktails to choose !
but i would stick to drinks only .
everything was exactly as i hoped - better even .
signs are clearly showing options .
our house was built in 0000 .
the bartenders are great .
bonus points : the manager - lrb - ?
our favorite local spot for quick weeknight dinner .
this place should only be for bowling .
- rrb - and dressed like <UNK> complexes .
the service is so so .
like the things you see on the food channel !
"otherwise , they are exactly the same size ."
ambience : it was a casual dine in .
they were the star of the show .
the italian wedding soup was delicious .
they had about 0 different lines .
that was the best part of the experience .
the latte was sweet and foamy .

great integrity and work ethic .
the occasional girl that should n't be <UNK> anymore .

the flavor and the crispy topping brought everything together .
all delicious and fresh .
we always love coming here .

love this hotel and love the lounges within .
0-00 i can always get fresh fruit and sushi .

". whatever , that ' s fine ."
i did n't even feel like i was dieting .
caribou is delicious and strong .

the foie gras ravioli was good .
this place was great !
we will definitely visit again .
definitely split them with a friend .
will definitely recommend them to others !
this is my new favorite place for any meal .
they do n't deserve any stars .
the best place you ' ll ever eat at !
and it hurt my teeth to bite into it !
kim chee and mac salad was <UNK> !
"again , our server was a sweetheart !"

and now for the bar part !
decent prices and fabulous service .

"all in all , i will definitely be returning ."
i definitely recommend this restaurant .
had to get an mri today .
wish the flavor was better .
and working out perfect !
all around great new little spot
the classes are great too .
the clean up at the hotel is very slow .
tokyo express has my favorite food on earth .
the music played is current and uplifting .
the cream was light and nicely done .
do not let busses go out that are unsafe .
the atmosphere was perfect .
the potatoes are nothing you have ever had anywhere !

finally they seat us at our two tables .
"doctor <UNK> was very caring , engaging and helpful ."
i love this place !
love the long curls !
"banana pudding , with <UNK> wafers right in it ."
we probably had to wait 00-00 minutes .
definitely the most bang for your buck .
"best part was karaoke , music was awesome ."
way to ruin our experience right of the bat .
- rrb - and the pita was so soft .
rude customer service and no one listens !
we all are ` ` drinkers ' ' .
it had a great feel .
a + from me and my two pups !
it was what i would expect but nothing special .
p . s . : $ 0.00 minimum for cards
everything was $ 0 or $ 0.00 .
it was quite <UNK> without being overly sweet .
my son and other guest loved it .
i also highly recommend the sea salt caramel gelato .
not too expensive & perfect for the family !
got barely any mayo .
the bed was soft but very comfortable .
the chicken is flavorful and the hummus is great .
it was lacking in creativity .
i really just wanted to use that phrase .
"love this environment , will be back soon !"
my favorite out of all i ' ve tried .
a plastic bottle of water .
the service was great !
the sandwiches were great too .
this is my favorite souvenir shop in vegas !
i was sadly disappointed with my food .
mac n cheese - it was nothing spectacular .
we were a large group of people .
the show has no breaks .
and there ' s ample seating !
try closer to the strip .
horrible service and food .
i would n't make a special trip back .
i got one of each .
i will be back !
"overall , i want to like this place ."
he actually did n't like it much either .
do they only carry illy ?
i would never go back again .
plus they had a mechanical bull .
shortly after his wine arrived from the other server .
fast and friendly service .
the staff is also friendly and attentive .
the pizza is wonderful and so are the salads .
ordered crab and spinach dip and calamari .
so not worth anything here .
had lunch at mark ' s today .
that being said ... it ' s pretty .
one of my favorite restaurants .
i absolutely love the homemade pasta here !
our favorite was the pumpkin budino .
no mini fridge or coffee makers .
i highly recommend bink ' s midtown !
this is my new favorite restaurant !
this thing is out of this world good .
ordered the american burger and it was bland !
oh the bbq rolls are great too !
"the food , especially the breakfast food is good ."
. it was pretty good .
i would definitely recommend them .
i ' ll definitely be going back !
we are soo glad we did !
we pretty much threw everything away .
sushi was n't good or fresh .
"yep , they ' ve got that , too ."
the doctor was short and sweet .

"i wish it was not tofu , though ."
save your hard earned money !
really fast service with really cute car wash dudes .

the waitstaff has always been really good .
the food was definitely <UNK> .
"meats , poultry , fish ."
i love the fried catfish plate .
i will never order anything ever again .
the food was great though .
food is always served quickly and hot .
a bit of communication would ' ve worked .
no customer service skills .
- there was outdoor seating .
we chose a high-top next to the bar .
the pretzel bread was the favorite of course .
i really enjoyed my meal .
will definitely come back when visiting vegas !
my brother had the chicken and waffles .
will definitely come again when i am able to !
everything is fresh and the service is excellent here !
for happy hour it is worth a stop .
i could eat those chips all day long .
this show was a blast !
too stuck up and over priced for gilbert .
staff is amazing our food came right away .
"please , bring this place to california !"
once seated our server took good care of us !
definitely recommend this place !
i can not express how horrible it was .
ca n't wait to go back !
everything about this place is well worth the price !
the celery i ate was crunchy .
it really is spicy .
no malt vinegar for what look like good fries .
and the portion was a good size .
the depth of their menu is impressive .
the meat was ok .
"yes , i can be bought ... by chocolate ."
"lastly , we had the duck salad ."
the bowling alley burger and kids meal were fine .
this place loves it ' s mini concept .
"food wise , it ' s cheap and good !"
so you essentially are calling me a liar then .
this was a fun friday night .
forgot what the names were .
' ' and sent us on our way !
i found this restaurant totally amazing !
the green chili sauce is super tasty .
really talented and charming .
so why not 0 stars ?
i love the laid back decor .
i also got the chocolate and carmel milkshake .
they did not seem inviting or welcoming at all .
that honestly was n't that big of deal either .
overall terrible ! ! terrible ! ! terrible ! !
which makes all the difference .
", lettuce , cucumber ... mmm ."
my son loved their tori katsu .
one day i will get to try the cake .
the driver was nice and very chatty .
the service was lacking though .
she said she trusted me .
really good japanese food .
michael was an artist .
both were so so .
they have everything from chocolate covered strawberries to croissants !
you can hear arguments outside all the time .
staff is friendly and welcoming .
the practice is very modern and clean .
it was fun to find ones that <UNK> her .
love love love this costco .
the service and eat-in parlor are basic .
"okay , maybe a little ."
. but worth it !
- rrb - and got it medium rare .
i will go every chance i get .
our favorite was the pair - lrb - brothers ?
however the service by the booth was <UNK> .
hottest bodies in town !
"yes , it ' s got fat in it ."
. 0 minutes later .
good - location is great !
completely happy with my stay here !
love the blueberry cobbler crepe .
please move the expo back on the strip .
keep up the amazing work ! !
not the best target i ' ve seen .
but you know what ?
you put your own sauce on .
... they offered an upgrade but at a price .
definitely the perfect spot for a health foodie .
add ' l notes ... .
i came back for 0nd times .
the guy helping me was a little bizarre .
how could i choose ?
some better moments than others .
"<UNK> , i tell ya !"
"not so great chicken , and a service charge ."
so we were hopeful .
that really made the dish !
they added nothing to the meal .
would definitely recommend it .
"it feels small , and cozy ."
the potato pancakes are tasty too !
there were 0 other people in there .
and the dessert was definitely not genuine italian tiramisu .
i also had a cup of their coffee .
i loved the decor .
my hubby and i had such a wonderful experience .
at least be polite to your customers .
. so i ca n't say much about that .
gave it a try and truly not disappointed !
- lrb - just my 0 cents !
i used to love sunday brunch at carefree station .
i ' ll be back !
they were just as good as we remembered .
overall i give this restaurant a meh .
would never be going back ... .
my favorite hotel in vegas .
my new favorite hike !
she really worried about having everything ready .
loved the wait staff .
"if you do n't , have no fear ."
do not use this company .
beautifully decorated and very well maintained .
our water glasses stayed full .
"the other important part , the food choices ."
first <UNK> not let the outside appearance fool you .
i kinda liked the decor .
side door has everything for everyone .
maybe i was n't in the mood .
tai chi chicken is delicious .
this place is a gem !
i thought there would be more selection of food .
we really enjoyed the paneer pakora and aloo tikki .
i made a same day appt .

my food was really salty too .
ca n't wait to see more shows !
pros : * something for everyone .

i ca n't wait to go back .
we came here back in june .
the ambiance is amazing !
where is our appetizer ?
". but overall , good service & nice location ."
i had the most bizarre experience here last night .
it is so much more sumptuous in person .
the scalp massage during my hair wash was fabulous !
this will be our last time at this location .
i enjoy the vegetarian sandwich .
love ya <UNK> farms cafe !
why not 0 stars ?
"big store , great prices and lots of variety ."
super close and convenient and great customer service !

the trendy interior and friendly staff are a plus .

i ' ve been here twice so far .
the fries were also excellent !
this dish is a must try .
that ' s why i love sprouts so much .
everyone is extremely helpful and friendly .
the coffee itself was alright .
it ' s such a fun place .
important : carefully inspect everything before you buy it .
and the staff are so friendly and super helpful .
hmmmm ... that was an interesting trade off .
cocktails are served in mason jars .
nothing like what was described on the menu .
or the hot yogi - so refreshing !
ca n't wait to have my color done !
i will not be going back .
. they manger was really amazing .
it overpowered the thin slices of chicken .
first : do not order the lemonade .
during the summer marquee day club is awesome !
i ' m afraid i might get sick .
coach house for sure !
they even pick you up .
<UNK> is such a good friend .

server described the specials .

"the combo , though , was a little awkward ."
again where is the class .
salad was to <UNK> to eat .
this is why i like to drink here .
too small for anything !
i love dr . <UNK> !
i really do n't either .
i fell in love with the watermelon flavored ones .
"first of all , i did a reserved table ."
everything has been wonderful and <UNK> quick .
we thought the service was lacking and slow .
more energy is definitely needed !
very pleased with their cleaning .

i would come back just for the brie !
the staff were very friendly and helpful .
dough is freshly made as well .
there was a good variety .
loved every bite of everything .
it was worth every penny !
i ordered an omelette and it was absolutely scrumptious .
this is still my fav .
"the food was hot , fresh and delicious ."
my pedicure was so-so .
this is my go-to for carne asada fries .
the women ' s bathroom was disgusting as well .
their cheese curds are devine .
definitely will go back here if i visit montreal .
loss of star for the stupid parking .
this is my new favorite hole in the wall .
as we parked we said ` ` woo hoo !
i highly recommend it .
it ' s $ 00 for the same thing .
the seafood taste like frozen food .
0.0 stars i came for a bridal shower .
"i asked for <UNK> , none ."
my favorite server from swish works here !
i still had fun .
also ordered a <UNK> that was huge .
so guess where i am ?
we ordered the ` ` kabuto ' ' omakase .
the food came quick & was delicious .
we arrived back at studio 00 at 0:00 am .
but this just makes me sound old .
i really like the forum shops !
this place is awesome !
my boyfriend ordered a boring old club sandwich .
nearly everything about my regular <UNK> burger was perfect .
"overall , i enjoyed his service ."
we also had the lobster tacos which were great .
they we ' re so personable and professional .
the service was great .
i will have cravings for this forever .
the staff is the nicest ever .
i ' m a creature of habit .
so i went on yelp !
this place is a must try !
the worst customer service .
how many <UNK> recieve stellar reviews on yelp ?
my dragon roll was delicious !
the rising sun burger was cooked perfectly !
"good sized portions and fresh , definite <UNK> fish !"
overall the food was decent .
they fixed it right away !
i can see why they are always busy .
the staff was pleasant and quiet .
the garlic fries were good .
the food came too late !
is it worth the money and 0 hour wait ?
it was odd is all .
it ' s a little hard to find .
i was quite impressed !
"eh , i was n't crazy about this place ."
did i also mention it was my first time ?
i always get the red sangria .
jane is very professional and thorough .
which they make the burger bun fresh each day !
it reminds me of a chipotle for mediterranean food .
i honestly ca n't pick a favorite .
pleasantly surprised at how much i loved the show .
everything on the menu looked tasty !
creative enough without being just plain old weird .
great place for a weekend breakfast !
i eat ice cream practically every day .
had a strawberry margarita .
outback is one ... .
delicious moist vanilla cake with raspberry mousse filling .
most of the food i had was disappointing .
"chocolates , robes , flowers ."
establishments like this need more people like them .
"ok , minus the darn stairs due to heels ."
my boyfriend ordered the shepherd ' s pie .
the cucumber salad was not refreshing .
perfect snack with a glass of wine girl time !
came out to $ 00 a piece .
a friend split the <UNK> with another friend .
friendly staff and convenient location .
"but , back to my schnitzel on a bun ."
i come here whenever i go to vegas .
. if i ever find one .
paid $ 00 did n't last very long .
was very impressed with their delivery .
what do most airports lack ?
i was definitely expecting something much better .
the bread was great !
the fries were so small .
we also got poutine .
just ate here for lunch .
we are so glad she sent us !
actually surprised that she had passed away .
it had a sweet and tangy taste to it .
all the drinks we ordered were prepared correctly also .
"dirty , gross , not fun at all ."
"the stuff is made of clouds , i swear ."
my boyfriend had the combo adobo the first time .
the grounds are very nice and kept wonderfully .
they were enough to share between two people .
great costumer service and clean environment .
it was a great time .
i would definitively go again !
i did n't like artichoke until last night !
i went back to try the promised quiche today .
- rrb - to my old stylist for color .
"i mean , us ."
add tip to that .
i ordered in and everyone was so nice .
"oh , they had finished their meal and left ."
jerry is his name !
beware of the wait .
all the food is wonderful .
i thought the food was really good .
so glad we found this place !
i appreciate the helpful service and consideration .
i ' ve genuinely enjoyed my last two visits .
they had all sorts !
food like this is worth it .
cab fare was less than the estimate on-line .
one word to describe it : incredible !
sushi to go in downtown : amazing concept !
i love the rose and crown .
the <UNK> was my favorite .
however <UNK> was able to find room for us .

the chicken shawarma plate is ridiculous .
this was supposed to be just a breakfast stop .
the biggest disappointment was the cornbread .

she was very helpful - thank you !
it could n't be any easier .

"great service , amazing food ."
"this will come back to bite me , hard ."
i would definitely come back when in montreal !
well our prayers have been answered !
"the store was clean , bright , and cheerful ."

"again , very good but a super small serving ."

"but my , the food is <UNK> ."
i had a group of about 0 with me .

this is just ... the best .
"love , love the salsa bar !"
i ordered the famous rigatoni d which was <UNK> !
<UNK> was n't properly cleaned .
the food is also really good !
i want to try their popping boba next time .
it ' s like entering a different world .
the queso dip was cold & thick .
although they do have a few options .
the patio at the dc ranch location is lovely !

the green beans were the standout .

i really think service in this place is <UNK> .
"maybe , but probably not to the restaurant ."
the bacon was inside the waffle !
the crab cake appetizer was fabulous .
we were seated at a table .
i should have taken some pics !
i wanted ... something different .
walk away from the chair !
food is fresh and the place is clean .
i usually order the vegetarian pita .
"always friendly waiters , too ."
recommendations and food were impeccable and cooked to perfection .
year old along with me .
the service dept is great too .
i was very disappointed .
i will no longer fear car shopping .

this really bothered me .
just beer - no wine or alcohol .

i bought my <UNK> experience on groupon .

spectacular is all i can say .
i would definitely eat here again when visiting canada .
the sheets and blankets were all soft and nice .
saw a groupon for this place and was intrigued .
i would definitely come to another show here .
except ... the sand painting was great !
the staff was friendly and helpful .
they care about their customers !
very patient and caring .
we waiting another 00 minutes for the brownie dessert .
cheesy fries - need i say more !
that ' s always a big one in edinburgh .
love the green corn tamale .
last night - we experienced a meh moment .
that moment was magical !
i do n't hold this against the venue .
<UNK> anything you do n't want wet .
kalua pork is good .
never knew orange and whisky tasted well together .
the food was really good .
i especially love the birds .
"first , let ' s just talk ambiance ."
this is my favorite location !
"food is excellent , especially the carne asada fries !"
everyone from host to server was super friendly .
so kudos for manager <UNK> and all his crew .
"while flavorful , it was n't worth $ 0.00 ."
i 000 % recommend using dan !
stayed here while traveling with work .
the best part about this hotel was their pool .
"also , it was so bland ."
i ordered a grilled octopus .
it came with sweet onions and lentils .
she gives me a salad .
best coffee shop in town !
no type of seasoning / sauce or anything !
items are nicely arranged but prices are too high !
anyway our waitor was nice .
but this just was n't it .
jennifer was <UNK> and she is awesome !
his combo was only $ 00 .
wings are my fave .
. its so stressful .
such a special toy <UNK> to her .
0am - 0pm while visiting i encountered this !
they are also very aware and helpful with allergies .
we wo n't be back .
i love authentic cuban food .
definitely not focused on the customer experience .
"our bartender , juan , was very attentive ."
not very good at all .
we waited and waited ... then waited some more .
"see ya soon , kelly ."
all the staff on deck are welcoming .
his happy hr menus was <UNK> with false advertising .
kinda ' like cotton candy .
my husband and i stopped in for lunch .
he still was chewing ... big clue guys !
but i still love it !
"overall , not impressed with dunkin donuts ."
it ' s so smooth and full of flavor .
everything was hot and freshly made .
definitely worth the drive .
the facility is fantastic !
gorgeous play pools to take the kids .
this was first trip to vegas .
it was definitely not my soda .
i give this place less than one year ! !
i learned a lot !
paying is quite the adventure .
he cheated me and possibly many others .
the glass noodles were cooked fine .
hard core hip hop .
the mojito was delicious and so was the waffles .
try it out if you have n't !
it definitely should n't be overlooked when ordering .
"food is good , basic og menu ."
ca n't wait to go farther next time .
my favorite roll here is the warm springs roll .
so all class long he kept <UNK> my space .
"however , i find it completely overwhelming ."
my mouth is watering thinking about it still !
sometimes you do n't even get that .
friendly and fast service !
i was dreading the process .
do n't go here !
this week i got <UNK> cucumbers .
the unloading was done in record time .
. made mine super spicy .
i highly recommend the fries with green chile queso .
our bread appetizer only came with some oil .
you could taste the actual bacon .
thinking his going to help us .
the decor was awesome - very welcoming and unique .
not spicy at all .
a restaurant worth returning to .
food is good and the portions are huge .
think they were rushing through .
we ended up leaving and eating after .
the food is not under / over seasoned .
try a specialty cocktail like the tiki bastard .
it was a waste of money .
our server was very nice and attentive .
this place is so chic .
i am a single mother with no family around .
go here all the time with my boyfriend .
we both agree that we love it !
"spotless , easy parking and very friendly ."
we also had the nachos which were really good .
this is my favorite breakfast restaurant !
spend your money elsewhere !
best customer service ever !
everything was spot on delicious !
what we saw made us walk in .
' ' so they start making the pancakes .
the outdoor patios are just wonderful .
it did n't start out too great .
this place is phenomenal !
it was my first time staying at this hotel .
beware of the fish i would not recommend .

". meat , rice ."
i never eat crab but this was great !
"really , really nice vibe in here ."
service is just how i like it .
"great ambience , great food great waitstaff"
"warm , fresh ... ."
the chocolate chip cookie also was so sickeningly sweet .
the food ... eh .
but it was so yummy .
left a bitter taste in my mouth .
we had an awesome experience .
it ' s super fast service .
just not worth it .
i got to new employee training super early today .
"- rrb - , and clams ."
"now , the desserts ."
their crepes are delicious and their staff is friendly .
this location is so slow .
he also tells my husband he has a cavity .
pita chips and hummus yum yum !
i found the espresso too bitter for my liking .
"- the patio , especially in the winter ."
we will be back !
they asked if we had ever been there before .
words can do only so much .
from the moment i walked in i felt welcomed !
the pad thai was really disappointing .
"she honestly killed the whole experience , really ."
i came yet back again with a friend .
they offered 000.00 just for the rings .
my food was not disappointing .
so clean and spacious .
two enthusiastic thumbs way up !
could have been earlier than 0:00 .
we came here for the hubs birthday pick .
and we had great service and a great time !
you get what you pay for .
i do not recommend this place .
we celebrated my birthday at orange sky recently .
"for this type of place , perfection !"
the food is solid .
the sunset and las vegas blvd one are scary !
i ' m in love .
went last night and it has potential but disorganized .
he successfully jump started my car .
very good food and nice atmosphere .
not impressed at all !
the arancini is outrageously yummy .
. i was intrigued and went in .
bulgogi tacos are also a favorite of mine !
everything was fresh and the portions were large .
i go there for the free popcorn .
the fries - okay .
i called to see what time they were closing .
. it was beef !

i will never ever drive to this dealership again .
my only suggestion would be to add more flavors .

their french fries are n't my favorite style .
the baby back ribs were yummy .
the pitcher was only $ 00 .
i love this place and its products !
i wish they did fresh pressed juices .

please remember that you work in the service industry .
beautifully constructed and a fun place to be !
i spent most of my meal without drinks .
first time trying <UNK> - lrb - appetizer .
at least that was worth it !
i indulge is them only every so often .
not to mention dessert .
not the best ; not the worst .

the cottage pie and tikka masala pasty was scrumptious !

great concept but could you feedback and improvement !
. i ordered the crab corn chowder and ceviche .
their recommendations were right on .
"regardless , it was still a steal !"
the costumes were dazzling with plenty of sparkle .
it ' s beautiful in there !
i ' m glad we stopped in here .
we split two appetizers and both were delicious .
"the chop salad is , of course , amazing ."
ak hits the spot every time !
they are moving us to a larger table !
many choices for vegetarians .
i ' m a huge fan of video paradise !
so so so excited to discover that !
"basically , i ' m a huge giada fan ."
i love the square pieces and thin crust .
but somehow it works .
the passion for their job is real .
loved there guacamole and <UNK> .
` ` medium well please !

waited about 00 minutes for the check .
"anyhow , worth the trip !"

i love their tacos and gorditas !
it ' s literally walking distance .
i make better lettuce wraps at home .
atmosphere is elegant and tranquil .
i got the lobster bisque and filet mignon .
"next time , mary !"
it was practically drool worthy !
"and not in that <UNK> way , either ."
their wood fire pizza is also delicious !
i like to see small businesses working together .
have you never ever try this place ?
the rest of the food was good .
"oh my gosh , it ' s addictive ."
i ' m pretty olive crazy .
you ' ll definitely feel like first class here .
do not shop here ! ! !
i mean he did the invoice and everything .
please note that they only accept cash .
you have few breakfast choices in lake las vegas .
great for eating in or take out .
why do i like <UNK> ' s ?
yum yum yum yum ... .
there are n't many like it out there .
the server brought my food to the table .
if you ' re into that .
we also got <UNK> bears .
solidly good mediterranean food !
i will never step foot in that store again !
but that sickly sweet teriyaki needs to go .
"however , the staff was very friendly ."
"overall , great dining experience ."
you get three large shrimp and two large scallops .
will be coming back for sure !
"after ordering , miso soup and salad were served ."
everything was very fresh and tasted delicious .
it was dr . g and he was great .
service not so much .
i suggest <UNK> the descriptions of their items though .
boy are we ever glad we did !
the bruschetta was the best part of the meal !
they bring her the salad with cheese of course .
it was his time .
there are go go dancers too .
"nothing special , really ."
the sauce was n't overly spicy either .
their lunch special was okay .
no warning just cancelled on me .
"overall , this was a pretty good truck !"
lastly my <UNK> tried some chocolates .
i love the hummus plate and the veggie burger !
we paid for multiple small plates and unlimited sangria .
it was sweet and creamy .
this review is for the casino area only .
luckily we were n't in a hurry .
. for their version of sweet and sour chicken .
i got the summer salad .
the staff here is always very nice and accommodating .
wow this place was awesome !
it had to of been about 00 people .
i have been here for dim sum and dinner .

i ' ve experienced better is right .
marc will find you the perfect stone !

i had the turkey dog .
"casino is small , cramped and dark ."
second visit : very disappointed !
we will definitely come back !
"second of all , the service was absolutely terrible ."
<UNK> writing on the bar .
food is only so so .
do n't skip the sushi it is amazing !
the oyster bar is hands down the best .
the <UNK> has a new fan !
it made me feel that i was screwed over .
piled high bite size pieces instead of rings .
definitely recommend this place !
the lunch special is huge and includes soup too .
also i think they need a little more <UNK> .
0 stars for fast & friendly customer service .
i already wrote a review for their other location .
' ' butter was n't even melted .
convenient location and close to where i live .
took 00 minutes to take dinner order .
after a few bites it <UNK> an addictive spice .
i was really disappointed with everything .
i went with my two daughters for sunday brunch .
the villa fit all of us comfortably .
i seriously ca n't stop eating these chips .

what a great atmosphere !
"this street is always alive , 00/0 ."
something for every palette .
i really loved <UNK> nelson .
i definitely will be back .
playgrounds have canopy over them to block the sun .
the potatoes and asparagus were good but not memorable .
"thick crust , fresh toppings , great service !"
it had a lot of flavor .
many people probably do not realize this .
but the bathrooms are very dirty .
there was no juiciness at all .
you just want a change ?
what could be better ?
"great massage , excellent customer service and reasonably priced ."
my husbands was the same .
it was so light and delicious .
all in all it was very affordable .
very nice people and very helpful .
it was clean and the beds were comfortable .

the cookies n cream was artificial and icy .
i had my shares too .
"it ' s starbucks , after all ."
the service was outstanding and the minister was amazing !

"yes , this place is amazing !"
for these reasons we wo n't be back .
wo n't be recommending again .
i never had an empty glass .
it was savory and delicious .
the greek salads are to die for !
we plan on going back again ... and again !
"overall , a good meal ."
how about the peanut butter and jelly wings ?
service : the service was slow ... and random .
service was pretty meh too .
i love the quality and quantity !
never again oyster bar .
. but this macaron was perfect !
sorry you had to do your job !
the food was very fresh and pretty tasty .
". , the workers is all friendly ."
choice of freshly made crusts .
$ 0 for unlimited broth .
it was carmelized i suppose ?
bonus points for fountain drinks and free water .
quite the fun in phoenix .
the <UNK> is my favorite .
his social interactions with me continued to be strange .
the service was a little slow .
one of these days i will try their salad .
maybe i should have asked .
my husband and i love this place !
let 0 servers know and they said okay !
he really made us feel special !
service was good and prompt !
waiter has pleasing personality and attentive and knowledgeable .

the perfect movie theater .
my co worker found a hair in her steak .
how about a change flight is 000 dollars !
it ' s pretty much just expensive babysitting .
nothing to write home about .
and if they do n't know .
i appreciate carly ' s .
thanks for an awesome time !
"it was flavorful , fresh and filled me up ."
their juices are good .
so look out for that ... !
what got my <UNK> attention was the food displays .
we probably frequent this place once a week .
the pies were runny .
the food is definitely comfort food .
chairs are also super comfy !
it was soooooooo sweet and so good .
went to buy a printer .
we ordered about 0 rolls and some edamame .
try the meatball and basil pizza !
i went here by myself to eat kbbq .
the pool was great .
"loved the atmosphere , food and wait staff ."
also lychee and the original tart .
got here for lunch ... place was hopping .
maybe they only like seasoned riders .
shrimp & grits - a close second .
there are often coupons online !
reminds me of back east a bit .
- sopes : yum !
the osso bucco was good .
bacon donut is just ok .
they must make their desserts from pure happiness .
the total for that was $ 00.00 !
theirs is too thin and grainy for me .
there i received prompt and caring help .
it saddens my soul .
i was in <UNK> shock .
"very rich , but small portions so not overwhelming ."
i had asparagus roll and avocado roll .
it was not even busy .
i think they also have live music too sometimes .
the bacon is crispy and not too fatty .
and it was cold !
the rooms are big and clean .
this will be a <UNK> next time for sure !
important because it was difficult to stop eating .
definitely worth the short drive to get there .
good solid food and matt was a great server .
the ice cream is fresh and super yummy .
ca n't wait to go back !
i would rather go to mcdonalds .
maybe they need new management !
i hate going to car service places .
both were savory and melt in your mouth good .
they have beyond wasted our time .
i thought the prices were fair considering the portions .
we also ordered the green chili pulled pork sliders .
but unfortunately i did n't .
"nice selection of dresses , btw ."
you ' ve been warned .
chips and salsa are pretty taste and free .
i personally feel like the building leaves something lacking .
and then we waited and waited .
we paid around $ 00 for everything .
"would stay again , and hopefully get better service ."
talk about a hidden gem !
the crepes are delicious !
staff is always nice .
she gives you more time .
water waitress would n't leave us alone .
"really fancy , really expensive ."
they were a little under staffed .
had a really nice dinner here .
we started off with some drinks .
we love this place .
the beef was a little sweet for my liking .
my heart was happy from this dish .
yes i just used that word to describe pizza .
ca n't wait to come back .
and the front desk people are really nice .
best i ' ve ever had !
"after eating mine , i always want more ."
scar and <UNK> were my two favorite performers .
the price for it was ridiculous .
the avocado club came out first .
service was prompt and they kept our coffees filled .
a + + service .
i still want that salmon burger !
the ticket times were ridiculous .
and the wait staff was amazing as well .
' ' that was our bbq banter .
we decided to take our dessert to go .
our apartment was not ready for move-in .
i will definately stay here again .
i will be recommending my friends & family !
she told me they were honest and efficient .
i do n't think is so bad .
second experience <UNK> it .

every dish is creatively crafted and something to enjoy .
very rude and unacceptable .
. let ' s get dessert !

went for their free wine tasting wed eve .
. i would n't order a slush here tbh .
they will not over charge you !
service was great and it was a nice decor .
this one did not .
their tomatoe soup is my fav !
it took another 00-00 minutes .
it is conveniently located along the venetian canal .
he warned us that portion size was huge .
the crabcakes are fabulous .
our server was pretty attentive .
corn fed things are not appealing to me .
they do n't care about their residents at all .
they go here often .
and the <UNK> options ?
however you will never hear from them again !
i did n't get it .
they do n't clean out of the trash bins .
"regrettably , it was n't my cup of tea ."
his grooming is meticulous .
how can u mess up on uni ?
this place is delicious !
maybe it ' s time that you did .

but we still decided to give it a shot .
no double queen beds .
i got the half soup / half sandwich .
"they have sparkling , red , and white ."
first time having fried oreos but enjoyed every bite .
starts bleeding profusely through his nose .
limited choices at 0am .
a good mix of old and new stuff .
just an okay place .
i say no sorry it ' s not that .
we will be back very very soon !
beds are comfy and everything is pretty updated .
such a fun inexpensive experience !
"mainly , this was because of the cost ."
"al and frank are honest , nice and affordable ."
service at the bar by kim h was terrible .
he called for and was given directions .
when you first walk on it looks okay .
but that doesnt mean it ' s only seafood .
the host asked if we had reservations .
food was perfectly cooked and delicious .
the waitress was very pleasant .
"go , eat , and ask for your discount !"
i was so angry i almost walked out .
you all are perfect !
we were told it was the strawberry shortcake .
which is really nice .
there was barely any people on a sunday .
"also , very delicious ."
it then tasted a bit better .
their chocolate croissants are amazing !
it just does n't taste right .
we were still nice about it as well .
great service as well !
convenient stop when you are at your <UNK> .
their egg rolls are yummy too !
i seriously love this store .
but everything was delicious .

i literally could n't have felt more loved .
the music was bumpin ' !
he is very professional .
the hubby and i were sweating bullets .
cheap and lots of food .
i have never had to pay for blood work .
it sucks oh my god it sucks .
scallops burst in my mouth .
are the vegas friends i made / making calling ?
i ' d highly recommend him to anyone !
i love coming here for lunch .
she was just go from one song to another .
<UNK> seal of approval is always a good thing .
the potato and shrimp were tasteless .
do n't go anywhere else !
"rich , creamy with fresh fruit ."
it was n't over whelming on your palate .
i had remembered that they had amazing blackberry cobbler .
and plenty for leftovers the next day .
the burgers are so good .
both were <UNK> better than my expectations !
i ' ll be back for lunch real soon !
the lighting is dim .
the sweet and spicy bbq sauce was the best !
"buttery , rich , fluffy amazing warm biscuits ."
he had his with the boiled egg as well .
copper blues is one of my favorite cityscape spots .
there were a few annoying things during our stay .
"sunny , cool , and breezy ."
i would definitely go back there .
"i wanted a well-prepared cocktail , and got it ."
husband loved the jalapeno slices .
i do n't know how they do that chicken .

i was in awe .
they were out of ginger beer .
this place was great !

such a time <UNK> .

"the service was good , too ."
i do n't know ... lets do it !
perfectly done and also delicious .
i had 0 pieces & left it alone .
everything i have eaten there is always good .
i will go back .
i always enjoy this honest to goodness italian food .
maybe the service is better .
they harassed us about the sales pitch again .
and apparently everyone knows about it !
we danced & relaxed when we got tired .
the service was smothering .
finally we had to have the sweet potato pie .
i was able to mix my own massage oil .
have n't tried the chocolate there yet .
this location is my favorite .
the bartenders are well versed in their product knowledge .
it was really good considering it was vegan style .
the waitress that we had was impatient and rude .
the <UNK> still tasted great though !
shop online if you can !
rented a small space from them .
not worth the money or the wait in line .
it can also get pretty crowded .
seems simple enough but amore makes it so wonderfully .
it ' s savory and not overly salty .
we tipped them $ 00 each .
i should have just ordered this and a salad .
started the buffet of buffet passes here !
service was absolutely fantastic .
- rrb - classes run about two hours .

pricey but worth it !
i <UNK> like this place !
loaded and you can taste some potatoes .
it was also dry .
we came here sunday morning for a wonderful breakfast .
the food is brought out very quickly .
everything from the service to our entrees were impeccable !
this place is too expensive for what you get .
this hotel is pretty glamorous .
i love that but be warned .
no love for the pizza crust .
flavor and freshness in the veggies was evident .
our first visit but certainly not our last !
okay but certainly not special .
at least half of her title was on point .
<UNK> up was a blast !
the waiter was nice and the photographer was pleasant .
i ' m definitely coming back !
0/0 those red chairs are so darn heavy .
got the crawfish boil ... yum !
then you pick your entree .
four stars for all the <UNK> .
i have super nose .
it was an alright soup .
the queso chorizo was absolutely freaking amazing !
"it had a romantic , intimate feel to it ."
our drinks were made fresh ... .
they said 00 min wait time .
"surprisingly , pretty good !"
it was crusty and yet soft inside .
the roma chicken sandwich was soggy !
"sweet jesus , give me the patience !"
thank you so much !
we also had dinner over there ... loved it !
enough to make my man want to walk out .
"bottom line food is fantastic , pastries delightful ."
i was still thoroughly entertained watching mystere .
a nice quiet oasis in phoenix !
went late on a tuesday night before a movie .

one of the best mexican restaurants in az . .
both of them were pretty good !
"excellent customer service , book it !"
the next time had similar wait times and tipping .
i love the bacon bar !
would never recommend to anyone .
i definitely recommend this place !
went based upon reviews and loved this place !
it is so unique and exquisite .
the service was really slow .
the bathroom was very small with only 0 sink .
"the service , the food everything was great !"
a + all around !
"huge wings , and beyond delicious !"
definitely a fun night out .
and last there bacon bloody mary is wonderful !
<UNK> worth every $ .
... every penny counts !
you wo n't find it here .
a great dining experience !
i doubt i ' d order it again .
everything we tried was superb .
smoked brisket and eggs ... amazing !
the encore is nice .
you could n't hear vocals at all .
` ` is n't it cider ?
does n't surprise me !
i love the <UNK> !
this flavorful concoction is the herbal salad .
the owners are also very nice and helpful !
"overall , the food was n't bad ."
$ 00 for 0 minutes of fun !
my shrimp and grits was fabulous !
the food is so good .
tips are <UNK> and should n't be asked for .
did they honestly expect ` ` authentic ' ' ?
the temp was 000 plus degrees .
the sides we ordered did n't disappoint .
<UNK> and his staff were friendly and professional .
finally another girl came in to work .
after being seated vinny was our server .
the talk is not 000 minutes .
- and beautiful to look at as well .
i actually did n't even enjoy it one bit .
this store is always clean .
but besides that it had a nice flavor .
it was convenient but that ' s about all .
just ate thee best pizza !
the meal : i ordered cioppino .
servers were nice though flustered seeming .
but i know people who love it .
the ingredients are top-notch .
then complained we only gave $ 00 tip .
"- __ - overall , it ' s okay ."
he called the drink a ` ` burnt <UNK> .
they check up on them after each visit .
we will definitely be back again !
everyone can agree this * is just ridiculous .
the staff was very friendly and attentive .
it looks amazing - a glossy candy red apple .
"in fact , it makes my boyfriend jealous ."
the owner is really very nice .
their flat bread pizza was also amazing !
hh food prices are overpriced in my opinion .
so do his kids .
as for the crust - i actually ate it !
especially since we paid for the tower suite .
she was pleasant and sweet .
refills on drinks are . 00 .
she ' s so sweet and beautiful as well .
however i was completely wrong .
the ambiance is car wash .
there was no willingness to offer anything .
"simple , yet delicious ."
worst customer service ever .
true example of customer service !
"it was nothing glamorous , definitely was n't impressed ."
it was perfect for a late lunch or snack .
the food is delicious as always and too expensive .
their also not very friendly .
we will be back .
love the old small town looking store .
i ordered the chicken sandwich with sprouts and avocado .
we just went to <UNK> for lunch .
very typical 0000s like .
the duck confit was delicious as well .
i will definitely be coming back .
try their french press coffee - its the best !
they have <UNK> <UNK> on the menu !
we got one appetizer and entrees .
he frequents this bar a lot & loves it .
the show was a little slow for me .
everything was 0 stars !
i will be back !
we will never go back to arizona frybread !
we arrived at about 00:00 <UNK> .
"thank you , <UNK> & district one !"
then we started telling people about the wedding .
they ' re open 00 hours !
their milkshakes are made with real ice cream .
we will be back .
our server was basically non-existent .
more like an icee texture .
it is usually $ 000 for an unlimited month .
they made the process so easy .
i would choose this place over starbucks any day !
the garlic bread was great !
we ordered the family size for $ 00 .
but the dj could have a better attitude .
"the pork belly is frozen , but still good ."
tasted just as good the next morning for breakfast .
' ' the stack was devoured .
would totally go back and just do the apps !
i love to sit at bars .
i yelped and saw all the stars .
we had to ask 0 times for our drinks .
not too pricey either .
now they are coming back with more salad dressing .
the full salads are huge !
i will definitively come back .
definitely not my cup of tea .
i would just get the vegetable ones next time .
luckily there ' s red devil !
what do i like about <UNK> ' s ?
highly recommend this place !
they are always so friendly and welcoming !
because its melt-in-your-mouth steak .
not that cheap either .
he could have just had 0 servings of that !
we were also missing half of our order .
bathroom was brand new and very modern .
"my white wine was served warm , gross ."
just awesome ca n't wait to go back !
she also refunded the exam fee .
we wee sat in booth against window .
just waiting for dessert !
staff is always welcoming and friendly .
get liquor in your coffee starting at 0:00 am .
everything was really good .
the store was tiny .
seeing the kitchen was awesome .
it screams ` ` <UNK> here !
i think that was a great deal !
i am a real sucker for fresh handmade tortillas .
not so much this time .
the quite atmosphere allows for conversations without shouting .
i also loved that they had non fat milk .
our pizza was really good .
overall a good experience .
you basically pay someone to put lotion on you .
totally delicious no matter what flavor !
definitely glad to have found this place !
they fixed it and it was all good .
go holsteins or go home .
"charming , i tell you !"
tons of choices and super yummy !
outdoor seating is a bonus .
. he also introduced them to mai <UNK> .
what can i say ?
everyone ' s food looked great .
nice rooms & exercise facility .
"the food was ok , nothing to rave about ."
soon we were made to feel like family .
"thai tea was very sweet , but yummy ."
it went well with the avocado and hummus .
it was okay but nothing to rave about .
* bacon-wrapped shrimp - big shrimp .
we wanted a casual lunch that included a burger !
the rooms are beautiful !
it was like a chocolate candy store to him .
i am a <UNK> concierge !
none of them disappoint .
everyone here is amazing !
i love this home depot !
will definitely be coming back for the ramen !
our server was melanie and she was the best !
went with a bunch of kiddies for a birthday .
we will continue to go back !
wish it would have been better .

there was also bad mold in the bathroom .
i also enjoyed their spicy beef tofu soup .
i go here for happy hour .

she messed up all 00 orders .
i will definitely be back ... .
my husband loved the fresh made biscuits and gravy .
"ok , so check this out ."
none of us were happy about the change .
otherwise what is the point .
we had the chicken .
he communicated it was his 0rd day .
we also had sides of rice and creole fries .
terrible service and the food was just as bad .
so we loaded everything up and went down .
but the best is the service .
he loves the oatmeal cookie and vanilla .
my husband had seared tuna from restaurant week menu .
there were no leftovers at our table .

everyone was so upset with them .
we sat in the back on the return flight .
he wanted me to feel special .
overall would highly recommend !
i liked the concept .
i have been here many times .
that goes for the rest of the staff too .
it ' s your average olive garden .

"it was a tuesday night , apparently trivia night ."
"also , these places are way <UNK> ."

the orange chicken and crab puffs are awesome !
- the empanadas : crust was flaky and golden .
"everyone is very friendly , especially the owner ."
the grits and collard greens just seemed too bland .
great individual size too .

plus an extra helping of salad on the side .
they have 0 massaging pedicure chairs in a row .
maybe she ' s trying to look busy ?
i love this place !

i could n't believe the rudeness .
great happy hour prices on mondays ... .
my husband got the stuffed french toast !
only complaint would be their mac-n-cheese .
they were very helpful and friendly .
are you joking $ 00 ?
it left me wanting something more .
i am a vegetarian and he is not .
"doughnuts were hot , fresh and good ."
the service was quick and friendly .
obviously not sleep and said excuse me .
"me , i prefer the clothes ."
so much for wanting one .
i was so excited to have deep dish !
especially with a <UNK> margarita !

we went there the day after .
dr <UNK> and her receptionist were great .

i first went to the salad bar .
very important in my book .

i love this place !

"not too sweet , not too bland either ."
0 - rrb - the unpretentious vibe .
even his staff was great .
"boy , am i glad we did ."
i honestly have dreams about your sushi .
it is very narrow and claustrophobic .
i parked in the lot next store .
we had a groupon .
"<UNK> salsa , did n't even touch it ."

"overall , i ' ll be back again tomorrow ."
"good , but a <UNK> sweet ."

"this is a <UNK> , <UNK> kinda place ."
the staff here is extremely nice !
we got to tour the kitchen !
boy was it worth it !
it was so fluffy !
we are still talking about these tacos .
these guys are amazing !
the staffers here were really friendly and welcoming .
this korean bbq buffet is super yummy .
we could n't really decide which we liked better .
"all beers , drinks and pizza are only half-off !"
all the way up to the big ladies stuff .
the menu is perfect for a breakfast place .
the horchata went perfectly with the tacos .
i will never return to this store ! !
it was great seeing so many old colleagues ... .
the room was kind of dirty but spacious .
our instructor was kayla and she was very helpful !
oh and the world cup on tv .
i brought them here for lunch .
and this was before the tests results came back .
large portions that are delicious and reasonably priced !
"i mean honestly , what a fricken rock star ."
the food was just so-so .
the food was beyond exceptional .
"no call , so i called again ."
a true hidden gem in vegas .
then i had to tip .
it has the og dim sum dishes .
m they had the burgers and enjoyed the burger .
i like that they have lunch and dinner specials .
very pleasant wines for such a good price .
the service is terrible .
ordering a dozen donuts and getting the extra <UNK> !
"it was edible , but nothing spectacular ."
that ' s my favorite part .
i would n't mind going back for another round .

you understood me right !
las <UNK> is my little piece of los angeles .
i will go again not happy .
"all <UNK> , naturally ."
i really like this place .
we had the guac and queso for <UNK> .
i do n't think we ' ll be back .
getting out was another thing all together .

"the best thing you can order , i swear ."
this location is closed !
everything he ' s ordered has been good .
"overall , fantastic experience ."
"so , so good ."

the enchilada was okay .
. she gave me my papers .
and i thought the portion was so small .
i do n't see myself returning here .
our total came to like $ 00 after tip .
they also do birthday cakes .

i would n't use any other plumber .
"also had the champagne cocktail , highly recommend it ."
prices are reasonable too .
i was greeted with a ` ` welcome back !
i love this place .
thank goodness because the wait was about 00 mins .
i will go back for sure .
he was just being a thief .
"and oh , their shop is adorable too !"
super-friendly staff and patrons .
he had a good sense of humor .
but overall it was good !
it was a fun day .
i never order anything else but their pizza .
we waited and looked around .
just 0 sheets to keep you warm in .
i ate a lot here .
i highly recommend to not go here .
the service was good .
"mushy , tasteless and blah ."
the pizza was decent .
but vendors seem to come and go a lot .
"me : long layers , whatever that is ."
i love the patio at this location as well .
they were not good .
the drinks were n't all that impressive .
he had both <UNK> & the owner with him .
i yearn for this sandwich !
tried this place for the very first time yesterday .
such a cute restaurant on the strip !
the selection is beautiful and laid out perfectly .
super friendly staff and the food was delish .
hardly anyone was there .
they both raved how great they were .
"other than that , everything was cheap and delicious ."
i did n't finish it .
and our whole group got in for free .
the food was ok .
thank you to the taco gods !
. gated entrance private but close to the strip !
we had a horrible experience tonight .
"chatty kathy , manny , was so slow ."
beautiful office and great staff .
he arrived on time and was very personable .
cost plus is my favorite place for christmas .
i tell her we just want a refund .
their drinks are really good though .
i was amazed at how delicious everything was .
the side of mexican street corn was awesome too .
the breakfast special was delicious as well .
oh lavo how i love thee !
our food was delicious .
bless the establishments that gave gluten free options !
they were fluffy and lightly sugared .
the shiitake mushrooms were amazing !
he told me no .
and i love the cut .

i was not late .
but you get to keep the glass !
"also , the service was horrible !"
banana is my favorite .
"after that , nothing ."
what does delux ' s owner know about sushi ?
found this boutique while browsing through a local magazine .
the floor we stayed played the best house music .
he ordered medium well .
our waitress was very sweet helpful .
i will come back to try more .
does it do the job ?
"like bacchanal , most items are <UNK> <UNK> ."
this place is so upscale arizona .
he was very helpful and explained some pricing briefly .
the atmosphere is lively and fun .
we will definitely be back to fnb .
my experience was awesome .
and you definitely can not beat the prices .
"fantastic breakfast , made to order and very affordable ."
i hope the next event is n't as windy .
just decent cheese with the usual <UNK> .
now i say it ' s the final straw !
it was also super affordable .
i will be dining at this taco bell again !
lots of the furniture was decently priced .
this was very true for this restaurant .
so i was not impressed by this at all .
"actually , wait ... do n't get there early ."
"thank you cindy , we will be back !"
i guess they change daily .
"everything else did , too ."
i ' m from maine and they had <UNK> .
<UNK> am glad i did not do that !
ling is very sensitive and passionate about helping people .
this place has super tasty food !
great place since i have <UNK> !
i loved the lo mein .
i also ordered a cup of tortilla soup .
the owner is absolutely lovely !
would i stay here again ?
years later ... not a penny .
i do n't even like peanut butter .
our experience was n't that great .
see you soon pineapple park !
would i recomend i a friend ?
very nice customers who are super helpful !
could not have been happier !
- lrb - not that bigger is better !
we tried the pretzels .
the experience is amazing and <UNK> .
rice was even stale .
the service was wonderful .
"great selection of pizza , pasta and salad !"
it was very large so he took half home .
"great presentation , they care !"
. this is probably visit # 0 .
i went with the vanilla ice cream .
then they gave us complimentary dessert !
i look forward to returning !
i forgot how good it was !
the staff is super accommodating .
lastly - the last one got the french toast .
i love the potatoes that come as a side .
"it was more <UNK> , than creamy ."
i ' m glad to recommend capitol plumbing !
she may have been new .
everything was quite tasty .
. he said it was ok .
i love this place !
and so easy to get to !
the outside was super crisp and the inside mushy .
. i wo n't be back .
. and boy was it perfect !
. pad thai fishy tasting .
that was 0 working days ago ... still waiting .
the portions are huge tho
and their shakes live up to their heavenly <UNK> .
i asked him to fix it twice .
not in a hurry to return and sit .
so this place was my only option .
delicious mouth watering flavor .
it was my birthday 0 .
i always leave there feeling fresh and new .
the service here is magnificent .
my dogs love it every year !
i highly recommend her !
my tech <UNK> - lrb - i think ?
i absolutely love this place .
i love this place .
just an over-hyped place .
definitely a tummy pleaser !
definitely worth checking out one of the <UNK> tours !
i ' m here just for it ... .
. but it was okay .
i loved the tots and the sweet potato fries .
"rude , rude , rude ."
"our food came out fast , and hot ."
my boyfriend and i decided to go anyways .
all their food is healthy and fresh .
"he has integrity , talent and finesse ."
we had no wait time on a monday night .
"the wings , as always , were delicious ."
it was very relaxing .
it was beautiful and the food was so good .
i am a fool .
i was very pleased !
we all loved our food and finished it all .
"not a problem , we thought ."
i love this place !
he gets 0 stars .
the cocktails are <UNK> .
"after this experience , i ' ve been converted ."
the flavor was a bit bland for my taste .
the family operates this company are so genuine .
best thai food i ever taste !
what more could a parent want ?
the adovada was saucy and totally <UNK> .
i ' ve had stronger and better .
i will never order from there again .
"however , it did not bother me ."
everyone was extremely organized and friendly .
go there or be square .
i usually sit at the bar .
i ' m happy with that .
. service was alright .
we struggled to figure out where these came from !
lo and behold they just opened !
those <UNK> fees are ridiculous .
that was the ` ` salad bar ' ' .
shrimp tacos and pomegranate margaritas are the best .
i would not frequent this bar again .
. we had the ham and figs and salsiccia .
i love these guys !
i am so happy lgo is at sky harbor .
the peanut sauce was perfect !
just had my couch cleaned by <UNK> .
three examples : 0 .
it feels so good to take care of myself .
so we walked over to bar <UNK> next door .
soup of the day was the tuscan tomato .
you wo n't be disappointed !
my children attended this school for 0 years .
"quick , accurate orders with friendly workers ."
my aps bill is always low .
the house drink alone was over $ 00.00 .
this place is a freaking joke .
their custards are delicious .
service can be hit or miss .
it ' s definitely a lot of fun though !
i think my favorite was the sweet potato chips .
the chicken salad sandwich was good .
by far the best sushi we have ever had .
all i can say it yuk .
the food is good proportions & always tasty .
it is often messy and things are all over .
and i will go back !
"anyway , we had a fun time here ."
there was an entree .
thank you lack ' s !
the lemon had just the right amount of tartness .
we figured a cupcake picnic was in order .
we were n't disappointed .
i need to come back for more .
i am very underwhelmed with this store .
we tired to make reservations and were unable to .
just wish the server was a little more timely .
i ' ll definitely be back to tap that .
big mistake for a pregnant woman .
he offered us shrimp .
i will be back to try more items
we just walked out before they could say anything .
did i mention they have unlimited booze ?
tried two flatbreads and a cupcake .
"it ' s okay , nothing memorable ."
we are now at nove italiano for our desserts .
we did n't want to risk another disappointment .
my nephew loves their cantaloupe juice .
they have both a seasonal and daily menu .
they have amazing sushi .
great breakfast options and friendly staff !
perfection at its finest !
"other than that , food was cold ."
love the guava monitors !
the atmosphere was actually pretty nice .
"second , lack luster appetizers ."
the bartender was <UNK> .
i swear i could eat the whole thing .
best margaritas and best customer service in town .
most were older young generation fans .
everywhere you look there is something new to see .
"it was quite cozy , clean and quiet ."
when this store first opened it was great !
the food is beyond bland and not memorable .
and the server was very nice and polite .
next time i will stick to the salad .
i have rancheros and it was very blah .
the espresso was delicious and we would definitely return .
not a pleasant experience .
we each ordered the red sangria which was great .
it had absolutely no taste .
"overall , a great start to restaurant week !"
"it was very pretty , though ."
<UNK> and i are crazy about beef jerky .
we saved room for dessert : a brownie sunday .
what a wonderful find !
we enjoyed the accompanying guac and spicy green salsa .
finger licking good does not begin to cover it .
everything is fresh and homemade tasting .
this food cart is great !
staff is attentive but not pushy .
kayla <UNK> was amazing !
price is also very cheap and a good atmosphere .
the housekeeping crew are as sweet as can be .
it was more than enough actually .
but eating one meal here is not so bad .
i really enjoyed this restaurant !
the gelato is great .
love to go for a girls night out !
i has the cheese pizza .
they bring the bottle to the table to pour .
so easy to eat .
this is a must for biscotti fans !
hip and cool without being pretentious .
the <UNK> soup is perfect every time !
sorry to the people who saw us eating !
great place to see a show .
"for the most part , this place was alright ."
there ' s nothing like <UNK> your own crab .
so now on to leasing .
i take that back .
their rosemary chicken is to die for !
i could n't sleep thinking about that .
we spiced everything at .
bummer they only had the one size .
nothing i have ever ordered has been sizzling .
do n't miss out on the boba tea .
"atmosphere is clean , but not very cozy ."
we had such a great afternoon together !
lately customer service has been great .
"but , i ' m not in austin ."
everything there is homemade even the bread for sandwiches !
the polenta lacked any flavor at all .
she was also very <UNK> to the guests .
sigh i reserved a car through southwest airlines .
i loved my stay here .
had my husband taste it just to be sure .
why did we wait so long ?
a semi pathetic dessert section if you ask me .
"yea , the food is garnish ."
<UNK> <UNK> ' s banh mi is effing great !
this is truly a great sushi spot .
it looks like it was a night club before .
want to see some food porn ?
what a fun place !
the injera was also very tasty .
lemongrass at aria i thought was a great find .
"i just ca n't , yet ."
check living social for deals !
ambiance is fun and service was wonderful and friendly .
i was so confused at this point .
we wont be back though .
they know how to make a whiskey ginger !
stayed in a standard room !
check it out asap .
the service at this location was good .
everything seemed to be fine ... at first .
"needless to say , we left ."
saves u a lot of walking .
"like , almost too big ."
just wanted a quick lunch .
"side dishes include baked potato , or mashed potatoes ."
the pizzas have interesting and yummy toppings on them .
i have decided not to go there again .
i ca n't say fresh enough !
it was pretty good .
i have n't tried the other stuff they offer .
love their little canister of foie gras .
wait time was very small .
we came here for lunch on a saturday .
she proceeded to hang up on me .
i consider myself a frequent flyer here .
good food for great price !
the lighting in this courtyard area is truly spectacular .
no sesame seeds on the roll .
i did like the actual burger .
god forbid one of them break .
everyone was so full and loved the food .
and the color is a light peach color .
having that high of quality is also not free .
i would certainly go back !
the bartender was cool though .
we absolutely hated our experience here .
"oh wait , found it in the closet ."
we walked in and were greeted right away .
i called it ` grainy ' .
i have found my neighborhood pizzeria favorite place .
this burro had way more egg and less chorizo .
so glad i found this gem .
what ' s not to like ?
we got the tiny car for two and left .
the salted caramel budino was out of this world .
better experience last time .
what i do know is the importance of recognition .
then i looked into the back room ... .
love the <UNK> in the back .
"' ' i mean seriously , they are great !"
the prices are also very reasonable .
it was n't busy .
they also have great chicken wings and wonton noodles .
i decided to go with it .
. mashed potatoes and gravy .
he could not be less interested in his job .
it is a tiny coffee shop .
everything we got was amazing .
this was <UNK> days .
i have found my new home !
it just tasted like regular ole vanilla to me .
i will definitely be coming back .
that is n't cool .
"for example , the mac and cheese is kraft ."
the food ... was <UNK> .
he also remembers how much i hate pickles .
do n't waste your time !
do not come here .
so beware of the money situation !
definitely surprised by the location of this bar .
this by far is my favorite buffet in vegas .
it was admittedly pretty darn good .
she helped me out with my heavy basket .
several different foods to choose so everyone is happy .
will definitely be coming back .
the decorations are also clearly somewhat mad men inspired .
the atmosphere of casbah is really cute .
they have great sunday mimosa specials - $ 0 !
i love the sport theme .
* they give free samples of their baked goods .
i brushed it off .
we next ask if there is smoking permitted outside .
you actually just seat yourself !
actually i would n't give it to my dog .
came in on a busy friday night .
"so , i put in another call ."
color me unimpressed with this place ... .
"potatoes , chili , cheese and two poached eggs ."
everything was so good .
very attentive and patient !
the hotel was okay .
i definitely ate well over $ 00 in meat .
talk about a disappointing experience .
i do n't know where to turn .
everyone should definitely go check this place out !
good service and good good !
"the food was inventive , which i really liked ."
went on a tuesday night with two friends .
parking lot was a nightmare .
we appreciate unique menus .
i ' m <UNK> between 0 and 0 stars .
it ' s new and was pleasantly surprised .
shannon and her team are awesome .

i ordered a vanilla chai latte which was delicious .

the baguette itself was delicious .
i absolutely loved the red curry .
even the ketchup was flavorful .
authentic and full of flavor .
"it , too , was good quality ."
we had a reservation .

"their tots ... omg , are to die for ."
i love fair trade !
delivery is not the best option .
this place was great !

every three olives vodka i could dream of !
it was $ 000 .
i really do appreciate that .
just saying ... or nice dinner .
and they have beer !
i definitely recommend going here .
wt ? ? it ' s vegas !
he wolfed down his without complaint .
"wow , this place is popular !"
he was very unhelpful and rude .
the pad thai here was okay .
all around fun day !

he even offered a tour .
there was indeed a lot of food .
not cool laura ... not ... cool .
the owner is very nice .
ray is really talented on all hair styles .
i would use them again for any project !
save your appetite and go to a real restaurant .
"i had the veggie benny , terrific ."
i had a bad experience here .
they have some tasty flavors of the day .
carnegie coffee company is everything i was looking for .
or maybe more meat .
this hotel is amazing .
i can assume it ' s a house dressing .
get the red velvet pancakes everyone !
it would just gross me out .
"unfortunately , nothing that we ordered was good ."
these doughnuts are delightful .
i would n't go to anyone else ... ever !
seriously its the bomb ! ! ! so fresh !
- restaurant service was horrible .
i still have some hope for this establishment .
almond and honeydew is usually what i order .
the service is always fast and friendly !
this hotel is gorgeous !
i did notice the employees pretty <UNK> .
the portion was large enough for 0 .
that will drive customers away .
"' ' girl , there you are !"
sides are good too .
- rrb - from the store .
". and we thought , not ."
the kids loved their plain and chocolate chip pancakes .
good stop after shopping !
the salad with gorgonzola is also pretty amazing .

. explained the whole process to us .
"i had two bites , did n't want more ."
that was very kind of him .
"again , i really wanted to enjoy this show ."
that part i loved .
paying close to $ 000 per person for dinner .
this basically confirms my wanting to visit africa .
the location is romantic and tranquil .
came here for lunch .
they came with delicious fried onions and sour cream .
the chipotle shrimp pizza is absolutely to die for .
i was immediately disappointed by the lack of organization .
i substituted the potatoes successfully .
"fast , friendly service ."
the food was delicious !
the vegetables were too salty and limp .
from four seasons to ritz carlton residence .
it was a disappointment .
these were very comparable .
the restaurant closed less than four months after that .
the mood in there was just kind of blah .
just have to be patient .
vanilla gorilla & peanut butter dream are my picks .
we got one of each .
i tried the oxtail soup .
the food was delicious and so flavorful .

0.00 for a slice of pizza .
egg rolls were average .
"oh , <UNK> <UNK> !"

the best part for me is the space .

kelsey transferred to this location so we followed her .
we ended up paying an additional $ 000.00 .
would i go back ?

the office staff are rude and unprofessional .
"again , this was just okay ."
we were n't all that impressed .

yum and drool all at the same time .
once that all got cleared .
that was one of reasons we kept going back .
this is becoming one of my favorite trails .
beer - pretty damn good !
i would leave a 0 if i could .
our salad was fresh and tasty .
totally worth it though .
started out with a round of drinks .
i personally enjoy the pickles with the peppers .
the orange one was my favorite !
what we did n't care for was the music .
i kind of miss this place !
unfortunately it was n't .
there was no way it was homemade .
absolutely adore pita jungle .
"okay , not a big deal ."
not worth it at all .
i want to leave at this point .
no women ' s and children .
that is until tootsie roll comes on .
i ' m probably like most of you .
"wow , everything was made beautifully and tasted amazing ."
my boyfriend received many kisses and hugs that night !
sue and her husband make me feel like family .
it ' s just a little neighborhood restaurant .
the carpets and toilet were dirty as well .
there was also obligatory chinese buffet pizza .
the staff are not the friendliest .
there ' s better places out there then this one

"very dim lighting , tiny dining area ."
absolutely terrible customer service .

the staff is wonderful and friendly .
out of drink flavors for special drinks .
i would recommend this place to anyone !

do n't be scared of the green things !
"zero service , zero help ."
it felt kind of wasteful .

"my waitress was pleasant , but inattentive ."
recently here for an event .
the server was also about 0 stars .
makes absolutely no sense .
do n't forget to get your stamp card too .
we ate in the buffet .
"and the steak ... oh , the steak ."
bathrooms need a bit of work .
"fast , efficient and honest !"
a truly stunningly amazing entertainer from start to finish .
that was extremely disappointing .

i was fairly insulted .
"so we left , glasses and all ."
if we could give a zero we would .
the back story makes her even <UNK> .
it was an absolutely ideal morning .
"i appreciate that jiffy lube has coupons , too ."

the food and service here is wonderful .
lots of seafood selections !
overall not a good trip by any means .
we get very few shows on demand .

there are so many nooks it ' s crazy .
nothing seemed that fresh or tasty .
"now , this was crazy ."
the mac n cheese was barely edible .
i go there every time i am in vegas !

very tender and flavorful .
came back here recently with my husband .
came here twice by myself .
they are open at 0:00 a !
little dive of a place that is so unassuming .
wine is meant to be enjoyed with food .
though the prices are reasonable .
"yo pretzel , yo pretzel <UNK> !"

i was told 0 pm .
totally worth the $ 0 .
my favourite of the night : miso soup !

talk about squashed excitement .
the theater itself pretty small .
decor is outdated but cute .
the server was attentive and personable .
i love their sesame chicken and pot stickers .

the desserts though are another story .
i recommend the butter <UNK> was fabulous !
"i have to admit , it was pretty neat !"
dining companion had a burger and fries .
such a great place .
or maybe i just do n't like their chicken .
we recently discovered this wonderful sushi restaurant !
the seafood pasta dish had a bland sauce .
totally disappointing based on all the good reviews !
"but , i can also respect their professionalism ."
we did n't even have to ask !
the employees there are so wonderful .
it was very disappointing .
the popovers melted in your mouth .
if i could give earthy 0.0 stars i would .
i do n't understand this show .
i am salivating while writing this .

i was really impressed with the service !
she did n't budge on her opinion .
the food was mediocre .
of course it was n't a problem !
' ' we walked around and ... nothing .

very over priced for $ 00 .
short drive off campus .
other than that - the same old .
everything is freshly prepared .
they answered any questions i had .
this place was too good to be true .
the seats are amazing in cinema suites .
they staff is also very nice and fun .
my son has seen dr <UNK> since birth .

i suggest going early or be prepared to wait .

"for myself , i ordered the grilled vegetable wrap ."
let ' s start with the venue .
it ' s shocking how close it is now !
it was quite reasonable .
it was all delicious and cooked really well .
. most of us ordered the chicken .
you ' ll be taking your shoes off anyway .
i really miss it .
there is n't the rush of bigger theaters .
it tasted like pancakes !
"not good , but not bad ."
i love this bar !
the overall feel of this restaurant was just perfect .
two words ... gold <UNK> !
there ' s nothing spectacular about this place .
i personally think it is a nice mix .
fast and friendly and the most excellent service !
absolutely amateur overly priced .
we had just finished a tour and were dead .
the drinks also left much to be desired .
it was just okay for me .
the crust was flaky and buttery .
we did n't see the manager once .

short review : ~ service was lacking .
i love the chili rellenos and tortillas .
"it is , though , decidedly hit or miss ."
the sauces complemented the flavors perfectly !
"i ' d eat here again , definitely ."
we left the whole basket there .
"marble bathroom counters , new furniture , etc . ."
we will be back .
dark & elegant decor .
neither apologized or offered any resolution .
the presentation of the food was just as stunning !
i plan on going back again before i leave !
i was sure i needed brakes .
"very , very affordable for vegas ."
we shared entrees and had two appetizers .
this place has seriously gone downhill .

great place to dine .
three stars for service .
she came out x0 when were we there .
i tried the filet tacos for an <UNK> !
this store is confusing .

"the cakes were small , but fresh ."
"well , this definitely stands out amongst the others ."
"i mean , seriously great ."
and its kind of annoying how the music <UNK> .
"an extremely chill , relaxing atmosphere ."
it is so good and the perfect office lunch .
"fast , delicious food ."
it offers a delicious variety of food .

we enjoyed the experience highly .
"unfortunately , their coffee is not that great ."
i ' ve ordered from here twice .

i just looked out .
my only complaint was ride costs .

this guy knows his stuff .
but i ca n't remember what it was called .
i ask for my money back .
i think its perfection !
we both loved the mission fries too .
this place is worth going to !
i was not impressed by the food at kushi .
there was a hair .
i will ask for a small side next time !
ca n't beat that .
everything i ' ve tried here has been amazing .
that was the only thing off putting for me .
0 sinks and separate vanity 0 .
and the portions are pretty filling .
the service is impeccable .
did i mention that they have wine on tap ?
both were really good .
i left a very happy customer indeed .
are you all seated ?
one of the dips was bleu cheese and divine !
i absolutely love this restaurant .
i was so excited to try this place .
i am really sad that they changed the crust .
"oh , and the server never came back ."
you get a good view of the whole club .
complimentary truffle popcorn from the chef ?
this place was better than i expected !
i got the chicken fried steak skillet .
even the salad was damn tasty .
i can not wait to go back again soon !
definitely a place to stop by and play .
lovely bit o salmon is just that !
they do not want return customers .
"i go for breakfast , usually to go ."
i was n't waiting forever which is appreciated .
we also got the buffalo chips which were delicious .
the prices are reasonable .
"first of all , the prices are very reasonable ."
"crap , wo n't go back"
the spicy shrimp with mixed vegetables are super yummy !
i felt like <UNK> .
but more than this is the service !
i am so happy to say i was wrong !
i did n't understand the craze .
"also , the pool area is <UNK> ."
it was almost sweet when i got it .
the only bad thing .
i also love the bath products they give you .
- rrb - this was not good business ethics .
they were very tasty .
i am scared for life .
seriously i can not get enough .
i like to try new things .
we will be returning again and again !
my morning dash to the atm was unnecessary .
daniel took my order and gave me great service !
"that was nice , and appreciated ."
the spice had a kick but not too much .
i always have to save room for my food !
otherwise this place is a favorite of mine .
this ross is always neat and clean .
two of us ordered the french dip .
my bf and i each had a macaron .
i am probably too upset about this .
i love this location !
winter vegetable salad is my favorite !
my husband got the chicken salad for $ 0 .
let me start with the salad .
i think i would come back to this hotel .
the frutti di mare .
. not too spicy but very flavorful
the wait room was disgusting .
its like a ghost town !
this place is just great !
"first , they forced him into a deep cleaning ."
the place smelled fishy when we first walked it .
it was n't moist enough .
we will probably return for sushi another time .
i have never made a better decision .
"creamy , nutty , silky and oh so good ."
i do n't remember .
seriously meat lovers you must stop here .
a splurge that was well worth every penny .
i was n't disappointed !
the cod and chips was alright .
the groupon said 00 % off .
i was in las vegas for 00 hours .
"if you feel like walking , go for it ."
"m loved her steak , potatoes , etc . ."
"our server , alyssa , was beautiful and helpful ."
my husband got the crab cakes .
laid back spot for sure !
i had ordered the general so wings .
i booked via expedia .
"overall , i ' ll be back ."
maybe other dishes really rock .
it was ... not so great .
so everyone talks about the bone marrow .
they also serve lunch .
i ' m still hopeful .
rice was too sticky and falling apart .
hopes way up now .
the wine was also good .
be advised that they are closed on sunday .
the hostess was rude .
we had a great time and some great pictures !
it ' s also relatively cheap too !
the sandwiches are beautifully made with perfect little layers .
the owners are so friendly .
"the pita bread was actually very good , however ."
taste like home cooking !
guess pizza hut lost a couple loyal customers ... .
the prices were reasonable .
we ordered a lot .
the smells are fabulous and will have you drooling .
we will most definitely visit again .
post <UNK> : this was a nightmare .
i will believe it .
it ' s a decent hotel for the price .
we eventually got our drinks after asking twice .
"then we stood their waiting , and waiting ."
the food is basic comfort food .
i highly recommend the tiger shrimp tamale appetizer .
kokomo ' s i love you .

it was festive being so close to the holidays !
their are better places for chinese take-out .
"i ordered the mediterranean salad , which was disgusting ."
he proceeds to start pressing the buttons for me .
it ' s so good !
"they have grooming , day care , and boarding ."
they only offer suites which was fine by me .
glad they did n't use fake stuff here !
long lines but it ' s so worth it !
going back for sure .
i have loved this place for 00 years !
"the food was great , and not pricey ."
do n't get those .

good <UNK> for the tummy .
the <UNK> salad was a refreshing side too .
it ' s a good time .
"the food was good , but not phenomenal ."
we went for breakfast and the food was good .
and it was delicious .
this is a great store !
it is organized and laid out well .
. but that ' s okay .
the fountain show and coordinated music were awesome .
everyone loved their food and will be back .
i came for the custard .
the fries were well-seasoned ... but mushy .
we also enjoyed the atmosphere .
but that does n't put me off !
the food was on point .
went to the tiesto event here in feb . .
service not so great either .
the rose macaroon was good !
it was a nightmare .
this was definitely the least painful oil change ever !
lol sorry i ' m tuff .
"service was friendly , food was good as always ."
this is definitely a pittsburgh classic .
we go through it find onions .
the room was really cute with a pool view .
* decor = had it ' s own charm .
"they had dark chocolate yogurt , love love love !"
everything was so plain and tasteless and dry .
then came the presentation of the bananas foster .
biggest salads on the planet !
the wait time was 00 minutes .
the food was amazing and so was the service .
the service was wonderful and the wine was great .
i love gay clubs .

what blew me away was the dessert !
this time we also had lobster fritters .
i ended up <UNK> payment 0x .
"customer service was awesome , and very comical !"
i like it a lot .
it tasted like horseradish mustard .
there are other sandwiches to try .
orange sky was everything i was expecting and more .
the wait time they quoted us was pretty accurate .
now for the pizza - it is just perfection .
"for the third , i ordered the chicken enchiladas ."

. mmmmm mmmm good !
the lychee was delicious !
i had it again during our 0nd visit .
i ordered at around 0pm !
just a heads up ... .
she was okay and checked with us .
the bar is cash-only .
their main goal is ripping off their customers .
this food is ridiculously good !
. fun place and very crowded on wednesday
our waiter philip was great .
maybe their server was also the chef .
the vibe is cool and the service is friendly .
. but my burger was less than appetizing .
i really liked the crowd involvement .
i enjoyed it very much .
and they were kinda small .
fine i can accept that .
. way too hot .
not a place i would go again .
i loved this place .
we split a 00oz filet mignon and grilled asparagus .
i had the chicken parmigiana and was it huge .
definitely a place to add to your bucket list !
chicken parmesan was delicious .
this place is amazing !
very fresh and kinda sweet .
"we are local , and we will be back ."
i do not want this to happen again .
not bland or too creamy .
. its annoying ... but whatever .
on a side note : drink before you go .
"excellent prices , service , selection ."
trust me it ' s much better that way !
"oh , i wonder why he got a flat !"
there were also several raffles and <UNK> .
i am a huge fan of this little place !
i was n't a fan of the shrimp scampi .
it was so refreshing !
. unless you want to see for yourself .
"the food was good , but not mind blowing ."
the food is quite authentic from what i understand .
this is a terrible company to work with !
nothing fancy ... i loved the blue wall .
<UNK> have lots of hair !
it was very creamy and very delicious .
we were pleasantly surprised .
they also have food .
the apricot habenero pork was delicious .
"and , it was <UNK> !"
i ' m buying my parents tickets !
seems like a rad idea !
i also love the tomato soup ... wow !
their plates are nice and big .
so - the food was awesome .
the portion is not that big .
i went for purses and shoes .
we will definitely be back !
love this corner pizza joint !
i ordered fries and gravy .
i also ordered mint tea .
the food was delicious !

big waste of money .
the name is so deceiving ...
i love everything about this place !
lovely service and convenient downtown location .
we will definitely be back !
so we both had the pesto pasta .
our dessert is tiramasu & coffee .
i loved the atmosphere too !
i would recommend medium heat .
<UNK> also had much less selection .
we love <UNK> ' s !
i thought the pork skins would have more flavor .
so glad they are in the neighborhood !
will go again and again .
and hallways that lead to ... where ?
<UNK> our instructor was awesome !
this chick was amazing .
he somehow managed to eat the whole thing .
there was minimal <UNK> have my procedure .
my little boy wolfed down his hamburger .
definitely worth the long wait !
the service was also good .
"our server , deanna , was so wonderful !"
we also had delicious vegetarian <UNK> .
fresh tuna and <UNK> !
but let me start from the beginning .
have never been disappointed .
"also , the office is always clean ."
"right now , monkfish liver is in season ."
our waiter promptly arrived to take our drink orders .
i would definitely come back .
they delivered it to me with non vegan spread .
i love taking friends and family here .
seriously and truly very very good food !
"i mean , it is cooked to order ."
i could go on .
i ' m usually a really patient person .
my jaw dropped and i exclaimed ` ` what !
"good fish , their tokyo express was quite nice ."
definitely worth the $ 00 bucks .
then finally the doctor came in .
we ' ll take our chances !
it had butter and chocolate and omg .
the experience could n't have been better .
because it ' s never open .
we shared the duck breast .
we ordered a 00 oz .
but expect to wait a long time .
"also , a delicious soup , too ."
it looked pretty legit to me .
everyone of their pizzas is worth trying !
both came in their own containers .
you cant do anything ?
very dry and lacked flavor .
recommend the guacamole and carne asada nachos .
food was fresh and prompt .
at least the sweet potato tots were still there .
it ' s a favorite !
it was so delicious .
more like packaged lunch meat and salad .
but the parts we ate were delicious .
am i getting <UNK> in my old age ?
- lrb - sigh - rrb - wow !
my favorite is the lobster cobb salad .
they are busy but very friendly .
the trainer gave us his number directly for contact .
"he is professional , informative , courteous , punctual ."
"what is gunk , you ask ?"
the entire staff is rude .
the atmosphere is very classy and trendy .
"remember , you get what you pay for !"
and we said no we are not .
we just up and left .
always great service & amazing food .
not what i had come to expect .
both tile & carpets look new .
the <UNK> ratio was pretty even .
our $ 00 breakfast only cost $ 00 .
this place does n't even deserve a star .
i went to their friday fish fry with family .
great server you have red square !
i wish they had shake shack in southern california .
the portions are huge .
"they offered bottled water , juice , and fruits ."
this is one of our new favorite places .
they have a white palate going on .
it ' s an ok boba place .
". okay , then !"
on the other half !
"btw , skip the cake pops !"
i adored the mussels .
this place is wonderful .
- lrb - something like that - rrb - .
"they do n't take reservations , mind you ."
"also , i enjoyed the ambiance in this restaurant ."
champagne brunch is an extra $ 0 .
"super over priced - typical vegas , i guess ."
horrible service at the bars .
the water was very clean and refreshing .
will definitely be back .
it ' s always greasy .
"yay , we are going home ."
my hot & sour soup was congealed and disgusting .
ra sushi bar was just decent .
our waitress struggled with english but she was nice .
you ca n't pay tip lower than 00 % .
prices are steep but worth it .
we will be back .
really great meal and ambiance .
oh and the prices were really low .
tiki lounge ... i ' ll be back !
this was the biggest waste of money ever .
so why 0 stars and not 0 ?
what we got for our money was very disappointing .
- rrb - ambience was relaxing and clean .
my only reservation : the sauce .
i am loving my <UNK> !
pad thai was ok .
"if ordering anything else , would recommend mild ."
the visual overload seems to scream buy me .
"- rrb - , and switched me over <UNK> ."
i highly discourage supporting this store .
not pleased with the thai food .
i will never see fish the same .
"no biggie , just left it on my plate ."
maine lobster pot pie was next .
you must try it .
so staff grounds pool our room was great .
00 ' s hip hop playing in the background .
my sushi roll was surprisingly really delicious and fresh !
i told her about my frustration .
definitely coming back here .
"excellent service , pool and restaurant ."
"the employees are always , always , always friendly ."
i would happily stay here again .
they well exceeded our expectations .
her only complaint was that it was too salty .
how <UNK> and well ... old .
there were only 0 other tables there .
it was ready on time too .
i wish we had sonic in hawaii !
"well , it will be our last time ."
the service was perfect and the food was amazing !
they even have a restaurant in there .
my sides are wrong too .
my husband ' s dish was just ok .
0 minutes to monte carlo .
there ' s nothing like it !
i would come back with a smaller party .
"all in all , average for me ."
they have a nut bar !
no one ever got our order .
staff was warm and inviting .
beer flights allow you to try the different brews .
"not bad , but not amazing ."
"staff is super friendly , and prices are reasonable ."
i would n't be surprised .
if you pick the individual seats ... they suck .
it ' s a great deal with these coupons !
"oh my goodness , it was delicious !"
thats why i gave 0 stars ... .
still no coffee refill offered .
both of us were severely disappointed .
wait time was 00-00 minutes .
do n't often love corporate chains .
now we ' re frustrated !
and you ' ll love every minute of it !
the only thing was their pricing .
so it was n't a big deal to me .
the location is perfect .
- rrb - but two more came .
"very accommodating , thank you !"
the chicken and waffles are like <UNK> !
i should have stuck with my usual ginger chicken .
the restaurant week menu was to die for .
i did n't mention dj ' s .
try it with cashews and broccoli !
this place is fantastic !
i love that they do this .
the front desk agent was so friendly and professional .
usually empty when i go .
the <UNK> balloon guy was just super .
` ` it actually looks like the picture !
delicious place for breakfast !
"people , not so much ."
the food is always consistent .
it was home cooking at its best and more .
the casino is clean and not too smokey .
got home and it didnt have as much flavor .
the breakfast was good and the staff friendly .
total was $ 000 .
but it did not .
did like the area that was snack friendly .
"also , where ' s the extra cheese ?"
i called to placed my order .
so today we decided to try again .
"c'mon , did n't you too ?"
i ca n't wait to try other menu items .
maybe it ' s new ?
told us he had other tables and was busy .
she said it was really good .
they were literally shoving his head in !
"they served bread , of course ."
save your time and go with a different company .
"i will definitely return , but probably for dinner ."
plus they come in little boards shaped like wisconsin .
good call fellow yelpers !
i always order the same things .
there is a hanging slide door .
"as for the food , it was a-ok !"
"omg , loved it ."
i was unsure about the sushi rice .
all other seams on the sofa are perfect .
my kids loved them .
"the ambiance , decor and service are luxurious ."
i called and he fit me in that day .
"she also suggests bangs , so i <UNK> it ."
too bad we always enjoyed it .
it is very casual and a little worn in .
ordered these for a bachelorette party .
it was very fresh and nice flavor .
0â 0/0 stars for the first night .
needless to say they have earned a returning customer !
i enjoyed watching the hot people .
all were pretty good .
this continued for the total of 0 hours .
it can be a great date restaurant too .
the pistachio latte was extremely delicious .
my husband is obsessed with the burgers .
this buffet is ridiculous .
"anyhow , this one seemed decent ."
the service was terrible .
it ' s bland and full of bland people .
' ' would go a long way !
i had a bite .
awesome service and beautiful decor .
- the inside is huge !
"he said , that ' s right ."
that is how unmemorable it was .
the even brought over fresh hot bread .
. our room rate was $ 000 <UNK> .
even the desserts to me were bad .
gave them another chance .
the pickles were amazing .
"then , around dessert time , i wanted coffee ."
bonus : real french waiter !
my hubby enjoyed it .
plus the chips were fresh and homemade .
0pm ! ! ! total bs .
sushi and dessert selection was mediocre .
loved the ambiance of this place .
just disappointed i did n't try this place sooner !
i think we sampled each salad between us all .
go here for drinks .
hubby ' s sandwich was an actual tuna melt .
and i mean major lacking .
such a waste of a great location .
overall great spot to try !
the crust has just the right amount of crunch .
- rrb - well her ears look perfect .
you love those things !
the hash browns were a particular stand out .
the men often unload the trucks on delivery day .
just the right amount of salt on the fries .
"probably , but not soon ."
"seriously , all thanks to michael !"
she muttered something under her breath and walked away .
i had a blast .
the staff was extremely friendly and polite !
so we sat there .
shane was working when i went in .
i absolutely love this place !
good for a warm meal on an awful day .
everything was just bland .
the answer we got in return ?
"the rest of the table agreed , as well ."
the lemonade needed way more sugar .
i never salt my food .
he put too much mayonnaise in it .
"this place is overhyped , ."
i just wish they had more in that basket !
"large portions , i can definitely say that !"
"overall , it is a nice place to live ."
and they are quick !
three machines were out of order .
the jalapeno poppers were not good .
"they were tiny , but good ."
the restaurant is located on university .
we ordered a side of orzo .
the best food we had in vegas .
but food was ok .
all of our buns were dry and crumbly .
"same design , etc . ."
"regardless , it was amazing !"
crust was awesome though !
so my clothes would fit better .
the decor is very stylish .
you ' re just in time for summer .
i would have liked more collard greens though .
the meat was very flavorful .
excellent service and delicious food .
i dream of the bucatini .
it was awkward to say the least .
we split a house salad .
i wish i had caught both of their names !
the kiosks were new and kind of neat .
i would recommend skipping on the sushi rolls .
"service good , friendly and fast ."
they have all sort of exotic fruit drinks .
had the corned beef reuben .
why only three stars then ?
got the gangnam combo .
i really liked the pork belly mini bites .
vote with your wallets / feet !
my mom found a mosquito in her food .
but this time my experience was so-so .
i ' ll be back !
the basket they bring you is huge !
love love love their food !
i had to wait in line for 00minutes .
bodies were on point .
do n't come for the ambience .
they have a job thanks to people like me .
went on a saturday .
it ' s a nice looking place !
this is certainly the best entertainment value in vegas !
but i ' ve gotten over it .
but decent <UNK> and people are nice .
the food and service was excellent !
it ' s inexpensive but really delicious .
i love tea time !
every flavor was so unique .
fried banana wrapped in bacon and chocolate .
the calzone crust was the biggest disappointment .
i love the salads at rubios .
"if they see , must be nice and share ."
"first time here , it ' s really good ."
the bone in rib-eye was worth every penny .
i <UNK> go back here .
makes a regular donut seem shameful .
very close to home .
it is my new favorite italian spot !
jade chicken quesadilla was the best .
but i think prices are ridiculous .
"as brittany mentioned , there are so many choices !"
my husband described as a walmart version grocery store .
"service was excellent , everyone was really friendly ."
i would definitely come back for this class .
interesting menu - lrb - want it with meat ?
the yogurt itself was great !
you can read about them at http://url .
my favorite is the super white tuna .
should of been a good to sign to leave .
the kids and i both enjoy peter piper pizza !
his staff made me feel very welcomed .
we had the margarita doc and added mushrooms .
. thanks continue with this service and very good taste
"<UNK> , makes me happy !"
the real downtown vegas !
the service was mixed .
i love surprisingly yummy restaurants in strip malls .
this is my first time coming here .
was on the phone at least an hour .
tao is amazing ! ! wow .
the food was good - nothing extra special .
the only thing bavarian about them was their size .
the food defiantly made up for her service though !
sadly it does n't seem entirely true at all .
i had the most amazing filet <UNK> ever !
the saag paneer is the best !
"besides sushi they have a great japanese menu , ."
one better than the next !
only sorry we could not try everything .
i love their unlimited ice cream .
she is amazing and great with color .
there was n't any real lag time between rolls .
they move you in & out quickly .
the toppings were really good .
service was quick and salad was delish .
i ' ve been here a bunch of times .
this place was amazing !
waitress was very attentive and smiled .
but the service is a little bit ... meh .
but my favorite is the chantilly whipped cream .
so we get those plus meatballs and margherita pizza .
i will be back for them !
service and food were great !
no alcohol here though .
we love tj ' s .
would definitely stay here again .
they are out of date and kind of faulty .
"fine , i paid , wait again ."
"the rooms are luxurious , clean , and comfortable ."
order the louisiana version of the lemon drop !
love me some carbs .
contrary to the rumors i received excellent service .
we decided to rent a car for our trip .
ginger was yellow not pink !
this mall is extremely overwhelming !
great place to bring your pet for a bath .
and get cozy with your neighbors !
my friends got chicken fingers and a salad .
small menu and gross bathrooms .
- lrb - aka my boyfriend !
our rooms had nothing but issues .
first contact was made at 0 am .
surprisingly yummy and cheap fish tacos .
"the tomato basil soup was awesome , though !"
both very yummy and good portions as well .
i would definitely recommend .
waste of time and money .
i am in love with the siam i am .
the pools are perfect for hanging out .
my boyfriend ordered the french toast monte cristo .
they are rude and inconsiderate .
no problem for dr . <UNK> !
fun browsing before a flight .
had the curried goat and jerk chicken .
so glad i made that decision .
definitely worth the drive across town in my opinion .
was hoping for more .
"merlot for me , napa pinot noir for him ."
"awful , awful , awful !"
i would come here again .
he hooked it up with mini pancakes .
i will be ordering that again .
service is always fast and friendly .
service is pretty standard .
we really liked it .
i was not happy .
i like this location !
will be coming back for more !
"and of course , a giant h & m ."
- rrb - the lounge chairs were super comfy .
ca n't wait to go again !
". melted <UNK> , tequila blanco ."
i loved this not sure why the bad reviews .
"so yeah , it aggravated me just a little ."
favorite place to get my wings !
"he replies , ` ` i was playing ."
she should have mentioned this beforehand .
the buffet is <UNK> with lots of options .
i had the grilled chicken salad burrito .
save your time and money !
friday night the line was super long .
i love the cilantro hummus and the beet hummus .
they had a little but if everything .
this is a cute hotel .
there are better stores in town .
recommend this location it ' s great !
a multitude of flavors exploding in your mouth !
our server also largely ignored us .
"charming atmosphere , interesting decor ."
i love this place .
she said it would not be covered by insurance .
service was quick and unobtrusive .
i guess they do n't want my money .
took the server forever to come take our order .
just make your reservations because it gets packed !
the wait felt like forever .
it was perfect thank you so much !
i assume from the condensed milk .
two of us shared crab cakes and caprese salad .
this place literally smells like roses !
everything else was great .
i love the food here .
you ca n't beat the ready made food either .
this was very annoying .
can not wait to go back .
only the sandwiches come with a salad or chips .
this review written by angela .
server was attentive and made it fun for him .
we will definitely be back several times a month .
awesome prices and awesome food !
very calm and serene .
that made it easier .
first of all i love to laugh .
i looked at the menu and i was frightened !
i bought a christmas shirt for my pug .
"food was good , staff was friendly ."
i am not typically a fan of chicken sandwiches .
i ordered the tostada with bulgogi meat .
i was here this morning and really liked it .
thankfully he was able to copy my key quickly .
make-your-own bloody mary bar !
what a charming little place .
their fries are actually my favorite of all time .
"fresh , healthy and delicious ."
all these things combined make <UNK> a local treasure !
- lrb - i just aged myself !
it has great parking !
definitely will go back !
they balance out some strong flavors incredibly well ... .
i was 000 % sold once i seen that .
the servers are always nice and pleasant .
the decor is funky and eclectic .
always in good hands !
the service was great .
my iced americano was very good .
ca n't wait to go back .
ranch tasted homemade and delicious .
this store is wonderful .
it came out piping hot !
"for dessert , we chocolate peanut butter crunch cake ."
or did they just call him that ?
it was nutella heaven with a straw .
bouchon had really great service .
i got my synthetic oil change here .
no one smiled once .
i ' m not sure which one it is .
"you go , and have a happy tummy !"
great spot for a work lunch !
food and coffee cold .
my brother got fried pickles which were soggy .
lobster paella was disappointing .
that was my only <UNK> .
not to mention everything is overpriced .
we paid tips twice !
it ' s worth a try !
my friend was also very pleased with the quiche .
or stop doing it .
the service was bad .
- rrb - so he deserves some props .
"my partner got lasagna , he loved it !"
it is n't thick and hard either .
so that was a bit confusing .
she was so nice and looked like a pixie !
drinks are always nice if you choose to partake .
i went to checkout and the cashier was giggling .
mr . flay puts the <UNK> !
i absolutely love this restaurant .
pros : clean place .
it needed about 0k worth of work .
i was fascinated by their lamp shades .
did you just say that it ' s illegal ?
we will definitely return again !
the hummus was just ok .
they had a great everyday deals on the menu .
. enter omnia ... .
there was just a lot of food left over !
"actually , do n't even think about it ."
- it got so warm !
there are no toiletries in the bathrooms .
very welcoming & sweet .
new york wins though .
". once again , we were amazed ."
you got ta see it to believe it !
we ' ve accepted this .
a highlight for me was the brownie sundae dessert .
booked a cleaning through groupon .
thumbs up from me and the cousin !
it was served on ice .
ca n't wait to come back .
i definitely recommend extra onions .
and do n't miss the nascar shop !
"<UNK> fools , all of them !"
thanks for all the reviews !
"will be coming back soon , thank you !"
"plus , my last crab plate was extremely salty ."
yelp did n't fail me yet again !
the hygienists are friendly and efficient .
the flavourful is all from the sesame .
"to begin , the building is stunning !"
the staff was not at all friendly .
think it sums it all up pretty nicely .
the chopped salad is a must .
my only complaint was the $ 0.00 water .
the resort grounds are truly beautiful .
the burger was really good .
it was not all that !
. oh and the carnival corn was wonderful !
we will stick to ordering them next time .
my husband had the kale and salmon salad .
it is a fancier version of a eggs benedict .
can menudo is much better than here !
the lobster bisque was not good .
we barely ate half of what we ordered .
stale lettuce and tomatoes .
i usually get the mariana and pasta .
a monopoly they have and it is not right !
. it ' s not sexy to go in .
this buffet was disgusting .
"seriously , so good ."
glad we ate before we went .
"every sauce they use , so delish ."
i usually get them done for special occasions .
just ordered food from here this evening for delivery .
the burgers were also mediocre .
"such a cool , spacious , hip place !"
$ 00 a day ?
but it ' s still delicious .
the chicken parm was n't crispy at all .
"loved them both , as did our guests ."
we will be back .
"overall , a solid three !"
i will definitely return .
i would not come here again .
definitely a good date night place .
i highly recommend the steak and eggs .
came here for saturday brunch .
what more can you ask for !
the nachos are my favorite with the homemade chips .
they were professional and hard working .
save yourself and your wallet but going somewhere else !
"he was very professional , polite , and attentive ."
excellent food and many vegetarian options !
"however , we were very disappointed with the enchilada ."
the food is delicious and the service was great .
that kind of service is what we love .
there was a pretty good portion of it too .
there was something for everyone .
our reservation was early 0:00 on a wednesday .
i ordered the singapore noodles and they were amazing .
we both got the harvest seasonal .
"cheap , authentic and filling ."
i wish i could give it no stars !
it was so <UNK> delicious .
made my stomach churn .
"wow , this was so good ."
jonathan was also helpful .
we will be back .
found our favorite chinese restaurant .
this is our usual go-to for delivery .
the only downside is the ladies room .
00am - 0000 was the busiest .
i really like the atmosphere .
the potatoes too are delicious !
the sizes are mighty hefty .
we also tried a sample of the raspberry cake .
they even have the wine carts !
always worth the visit .
it was so decadent and yet fresh and light !
we stumbled upon this place completely by accident .
my new favorite restaurant for sure !
"lastly , the spa at encore ."
the sound was awful .
no plates or food in <UNK> line !
the people are nice .
would definitely come back for more pizza !
"it was kind of good , but only ok ."
it ' s why too overcrowded servers !
"for my entree , i got salmon ."
they are closed sundays and mondays .
"the place was colorful , eclectic and earthy ."
ah ... vegas - you got ta love it .
"food was great , and the delivery was quick !"
would recommend this place to any chocolate lover !
he wished us a happy anniversary .
this place totally changed my mind about pawn shops .
as for the coffee .

service is friendly and welcoming as well as informative .

it ruins the experience of the ambiance .
i left this location less than two minutes ago .
they were boring and flavorless .
close to my house and convenient parking .

it was savory and delicious .
they also have extensive vegetarian options .
i was very happy we went !

and dessert of white and dark chocolate was stupendous !

the scenery is romantic and classy .

the food was good .
"well , i found one here ... ."
they ' ve got homemade anything and everything .
i ' ve only been once .
the menu is massive .
and then they fed me too !
they are runners themselves and very knowledgeable about running .
we also split the fondue from the regular menu .
- pb & b pudding dessert is necessary .
my smoothies was such a dissapointment .
definitely be prepared for that .
i wo n't be returning .
lake las vegas has seen its ups and downs .
my mouth is watering just thinking about it !

looks like a cool enough bar though .
it gets better ... .
its all i order !
the rooms are awesome !
mmmmm i want to go eat there now .
go eat at nook !
the hummus with chicken was huge !
everything was cooked perfectly .
we have faith in the doctors and the staff .
i try to find good things about it .
i feel so bad for some of those people .
"some things were good , some not so good ."
sadly this was nothing special .
delivery was quick and food was delicious !
omg what a wonderful pain free experience .
and totally reasonably priced .
do not go on your lunch break .
<UNK> is $ 00.00 .
absolutely love their vibe the place gives off .
"love their red bean ice cream , too ."
these people know what they ' re doing .
and it ' s in a busy industrial center .
the hotel was nice .
it ' s not even worth 0star !
we were all hungry 0 .
my fajitas were delish !
it is also a great value .
the ticket counter has so cool stuff too .
today was no different .

and am so glad i did !
my husband & father love the <UNK> smell intoxicating .

i call and ask to speak with a manager .
be prepared to eat !
i will definitely return for my future photography needs .
they have tons of rum concoctions to choose from .
our filets were tender and savory .
got to try it .
"very professional , positive vibes , & good music ."
boyfriend does n't get the hype about trader joes .
whichever floats your boat .
i have to strongly encourage you get the soup .
"they have , by far , the best chips ."
was heading to <UNK> for the long weekend .
all this and there were only 0 guys working !
at first it was a little intimidating .
or a shower for that matter ?
all were perfectly mixed .
hot dog - pretty much as expected .
tea was a bit bitter .
this place really reminds me of authentic mexican food .
i ' ll never come back here .

they give fresh chips and salsa .
i have seen all the doctors .
i think they should get more business .
mixed drinks looked pricey but beer seemed reasonable .
i love this place .
<UNK> the park is usually empty until late afternoon !
nothing like a sprinkle of cheese on your steak !
i can forgive the bread .
now i know why my dog smelled so bad .
the decor did not make my eyes hurt .
came here from out of town .
they are the nicest people .
this had me a little worried .
no call or follow up from maintenance .
the bottled orange juice was good .
the setting of the restaurant is nice .
. he apparently did n't install it correctly .
i ' ve eaten at <UNK> twice .
we had the zucchini chips which we loved !
lots of seat to sit .
i hope everyone likes their subs the same .
a picnic bench would have been more pleasant .
i would suggest everyone to go to this restaurant .
it was wonderfully hot without being unpleasant .
the vase is a keeper too .
that ' s about it .
the yellowtail in that was fantastic .
it ' s just ridiculous .
we absolutely love viva chicken .
great atmosphere and great service .
not bad for a fast food joint !
but have to mention the lobster bisque .
and i ' m so glad we did .
our reservations were for 0:00 .
the portions for lunch are enough to fill you .
painted with bright colors .
they tried to make us pay $ 00 cover .

nicely breaded with panko and was really tasty .
they were both delicious !
the food was also delicious comfort food .
- rrb - event for prizes !
such a beautiful property !

the eggs were just eggs .
what more can a girl ask for ?
not too tart and the crust was good .
then i saw my room .
you wo n't find it anywhere else !
"service is always good , atmosphere is great !"
i also ordered the rosemary chicken sandwich .
"they have boarding , grooming and daycare available ."
loved the sweet potato fries and the beer .
they also offer breakfast and brunch .
we walked in and were immediately seated .
our server was prompt but not super friendly .
my mamma and i used to eat lunch there .
"oh , the waitress only had three tables ."
the only downside was the cell phone service .
definitely one of my favorite places to eat .

s & s employees were very pleasant and helpful .
"nonetheless , this food is totally worth waiting for ."
and he said trust me !
"however , the <UNK> was so fresh and delicious ."

now i ' ll start from the beginning .
yum this place is delicious !
there were only four other tables with customers .
"returned again , based on my first good experience ."
"simply put , you ' ll have a blast !"
sushi is always fresh .
i ordered the cajun salmon salad .
it ' s buttery and melts in your mouth .
we had a great time .
do n't do it .
"everything came hot , fresh and delicious ."
it ' s probably because of their inventive toppings .
"protein style well-done ... going , going , gone !"
the people are friendly and the location is great .
you <UNK> what you sow .
our service was ok .
i love this place !
i ' ve been coming here for 0 years .

<UNK> # 0 - the customer service .
we arrived around 00:00 am .
this review is for the rec center side only .
it is a relaxing ding experience .
i ca n't wait to go back .
not a lot of variety .
the <UNK> system is just strange and inefficient .
we ordered a <UNK> and a <UNK> .
my favorite roll is the salmon lovers .

the food was great .
caramel + salt = talk to you soon !
"i like trying new places , especially non-chain places ."
ambience - - love it !
"however , those are my only 0 complaints ."
the server checked on us plenty of times .
too yummy for words to explains .
it ' s definitely a cool concept !
. er barrio cafe ... but i digress .
i have been thinking about that salmon ever since .
my husband was n't able to get it open .
"i usually skip crepes , too sweet for me ."
they were inhaled pretty quickly .
servers were passionate to serve us and entertained us .
checked it out and i actually like it .
i will not be back here anytime soon .
i ' m not impressed .
so thick and juicy !
the dessert place at aria is awesome !
not too little with ryan ever present .
i never did find one that was 00lbs .

every time i go i shudder a little .
their spring rolls are tasty too .

i sat there inside and ate my fro yo .
fantastic location - just opposite the metro .
"yum , yum & more yum !"
some nudity ; my husband appreciated that !
i am a huge fan of mario <UNK> .

i love this place !
00 stars and beyond !

service was extremely fast !
we had fried ravioli appetizers .
but this place deserves the 0 stars .
"overall , kings fish house is n't bad ."
"naturally , we got one of each to share ."
they were ... delicious .
i will never go there again !
staples is too large .
you did it again jason !
but i did not taste pistachio in my latte .
i figured ; i would try it here .
the changing area is spacious and always clean .
. there are much better vietnamese restaurant around .
"however , the baguettes were delicious ."
the woman also let us smell the tea .
"i mean , really loud and crowded ."
the rings were nice and crispy .
. i really like this place .
"well , that is a sorry excuse ."
"my fiance had dozens of crab legs , literally ."
make sure to try and sit at the counter .
it is located out in the <UNK> .
i thought i was high maintenance .
i have only had bad service there once .
. get your stuff together !
this is my new go-to for ayce .
olive garden who ? ! great portions .
worth the time and cash .
the food is always hot and delicious .
two floors of awesomeness .
"he left something , yes his fault ."
the pretty servers with bangin ' bodies and tattoos .
how i love a <UNK> salad .
the girls bean and cheese burritos were good .
"wednesday however , was a different story ."
i ca n't wait to try the chowder !
. it is good too : - - rrb -
we are not ready !
seemed to do the trick .
"if you go , you must try this !"
"despite that , the staff is super nice ."
they add pineapple to theirs which is my thing .
just ... kinda weird .
the steak was flavorful .
the green shake and wellness drink are my favorite .
even the bread with butter .
my boyfriend ordered some seafood platter thing .
so how was this <UNK> hot chocolate ?
brunch on sunday mornings are my favorite .
the manager even came over and greeted our table .
trust my car was <UNK> when i brought in .
i will definitely go again !
i ' m still craving it .
the ravioli was to die for !
so soft and delicious .
price is too much for the boring food .
there is also a weight machine .
love <UNK> here and getting protein after workouts .
<UNK> is the man !
"the decor is very minimalist , but inviting ."
this made me so sad .
the plain one here has a strange aftertaste .
we were there for the three course lunch .
half the seating looked like high school lunch tables .
the service is very nice !
whoever made the food messed up the order completely .
typical for a resturaunt .
except the crazy hot ones .
i love the chocolate here .
bachi is truly amazing .
we will definitely be back many times .
but it did not take away the fishy taste .
i did n't but my boyfriend did .
great little greek place !
another perk - the waitresses are actually really nice .
"the bread tasted like syrup , though ."
the checklist they fulfilled : - clean .
the rest of the food looked mediocre .
the sweet & sour chicken was average .
it ' s too pricey to be worth it .
you can always shop in the forum while waiting .
we ordered a lot of food .
it was all just surreal .
"well , here ' s the kicker ."
the music they played was good .
they treat you like family .
the food was great and creative .
truly was worth the calories .
the eggs benedict was pretty good .
so do n't get that !
went because i had some bogo coupons .
great brunch place and great atmosphere .
the thai basil is also amazing .
huge bowl and delicious .
i liked the coconut flavor and fresh basil .
i was n't pleased with the service .
definitely will be calling them again
could see the sweat on their brows .
we also shared the gold standard burger .
we only paid $ 00 .
one of the best hangover foods you can get .
i had the combo with the raspberry french toast .
"luckily , our indoor seating was still <UNK> ."
the pool was nice and not too packed .
we liked the burger sauce .
"all in all , such a major disappointment ."
love the live music when they have it .
then my index finger on my other hand .
have to say i was not impressed .
the hostile grape is such a creative idea .
i try to come here on a weekday night .
another favorite was the smoky chicken <UNK> .
it is a little restaurant serving up great sushi !
and comfort is what matters the most !
i just wish they were out there before 0pm .
it was really refreshing !
they had a great selection of different cuisines !
strongly recommend to try .
we will be back for sure .
it smelled so badly of like sewage or something .
my face looks and feels soft and <UNK> .
the staff are really nice and friendly .
super disappointed after wanting to try new bakeries .
we will not be returning to this place .

great food at a great price !
i could n't be more satisfied with this place !
congrats to the creator of this dessert !

we were sat down and given several different flavors .
the food and the service is excellent and fast !
the staff was friendly and the prices were good !
i got a celery and avocado sandwich .
we always have been very pleased .
we were n't in the sharing mood .
i was still charged for some of the room .
the host said ` ` absolutely ' ' .
i love the food here well the pasta .
- lrb - and you should see it all !
"also , the location is hard to find ."
patio is small but cute !
"second , the dressings are ` ` salty ."
but we always go back for the same things !
my husband and i usually come for breakfast .
she was beyond rude .
treat everyone like friends .
i love this little store .
and rosie is the best ! ! !
i would even order it again .
this place has everything you cancer lovers need .
it was very annoying !
that is about where the stars stop !
the service is great and very professional .
if i order a regular i want a regular !
"welcome to the sweet scene , novel sweets !"
least favorite had a ton of wonderful mushrooms .
"guys show up today , again , no jose ."
so we stayed at caesars .
so much flavor in every bite we took .
how is that the fault of the marketplace ?
the food was good .
should have been my second sign .
"finally , a <UNK> , <UNK> place for everyone ."
also tried the steak sandwich .
tangy with a little bit of a bite .
wo n't be going back .
we came in and had the bottomless champagne .
it still was n't done yet .
perch is great too and the portion was huge !
plus the food is amazing !
a <UNK> frozen yogurt spot .
one medium coffee with raspberry .
excellent service and food !
we were a hit !
i could n't be happier !
maybe a little too friendly ?
so good i can drink it .
just like being in cali !
the amuse bouche was a lovely surprise .
pho so 0 just feels like home .
one of the other girls got corned beef hash .
i did enjoy the shoestring fries .
and then eat it .
the broth and toppings were a nice variety .

this place is amazing !
0 star all the way !

the quality of their massages is consistently excellent .
everything we ordered was delicious !
the cocktails are great .
everything went smoothly and all items were included .
life this place and the workers !
which he loves their omelette scramble .
my avocado was also white .
$ 0 a tube is n't really worth it .
it was to die for .
we will definitely be back soon to enjoy dinner !
mind you i appreciate stuff like tim burton films .
they absolutely love it !
reserve a booth for an intimate meal .
it came with rice and beans .
my dessert definitely did not <UNK> !
it was pretty busy .
had a wonderful meal with my husband .
"and <UNK> , you ' re the best ever !"
i do n't care if they ' re slow .
my boyfriend is obsessed with the tomato bisque .
i was pretty choked .
i loved the sundae .
we are all in our <UNK> twenties .
if the cooks had our order .
"we had a great time , lots of laughs !"
we will absolutely recommend and return !

he said he would make it special .
perfect mixture between amazing food and great service .

the gym has many <UNK> and a boxing ring !

i was hesitant with the tuna tartar nachos .

the jumbo shrimp was cooked to perfection .
another annoyance was the construction .
"not super friendly , but not mean either ."
the energy is positive and healing .
"when i opened the packages , they smelled terrible ."
"after all , is n't that the point ?"
i would definitely utilize bellhops again .
our server was attentive .

not really sure i care to return .
i ordered the mongolian chicken .
i ' m not a fan .
i could deff see us becoming regulars .

i lost the 00 lbs .
if i could give <UNK> more stars i would !
but what can i say ?
the others tasted mediocre .
definitely good for the younger crowd .
we did leave her $ 00 .
this place hit the spot .
"the sausage breakfast burrito was great , too ."
she did n't even give is a receipt .
probably would n't go back .
so that was nice .
the cars are amazing !
the garlic aioli was heavy ; not a fan .
and it was n't that good .
the kids meals are totally overpriced .
make your drink just how you want it .

the amaebi was a bigger portion and pretty nice .
i would say skip it .
egg salad sandwiches - to die for !

"sadly , the place was empty ."
she is the reason why i have not returned .
a + to aj ' s !

the main house we are disappointed in .
great place to go for an after clubbing snack !
the vibe was weird .
the wait staff was horrible .
"kind of mushy , this i did n't like ."
this is a very original dish .
if you have n't tried them you should !
"basically , are you lonely ?"
"the food is messy , but so delicious !"
overall ... not bad .
"brandy , the cruise specialist has been amazing ."
great office location and clean rooms !

i ca n't recommend <UNK> dental enough .
oh and the service is okay .
my boyfriend loves the strawberry banana .
too much chemistry here .
there was also a lingering unpleasant odor .
a little love goes a long way !
but the rue 00 in here upset me .
i do not function like that .
are you kidding me ?
it was so overcooked and completely bland .
"also , i confirmed with them the day before ."

i know i ' ll be .
the donuts are delish .
everything melted to perfection .
the owner was a gracious host .

tanzy did n't disappoint !
we each had one piece and tossed the rest .
"and to be honest , it remained the star ."
"the club music , drinks and atmosphere were great ."
no pain at all during my 0 fillings .
i ended up actually eating that stuff .
"crispy , slightly spicy , perfectly cooked with nuances ."
the majority of the front desk staff is unhelpful .

the roommate and i were staying at the cosmopolitan .
"lucky me , i got a free lunch !"
they make a pretty mean burger too .
so this is my favorite way to travel now .
the pistachio - lrb - which should be chunky !
the <UNK> was nice .
what an amazing meal .
they need to provide a comforter .
the body and mind can do amazing things .
who would turn down free meatballs ?
it was so bland !
forget the common cleaning company names .
i lost $ 0 to a slot machine .
i wo n't be coming here again !
the rooms were clean but old .

our breakfast was wonderful .
we ordered the bacon soft and it was crisp .
"ordered the woody , messy but delicious !"

the nachos were not really nachos .
the <UNK> tone and stares were so appalling .
what more could you ask for .
i guess i was meant to eat at yama .
definitely set the standards for korean bbq for me .
we love this place .

i was wanting an inexpensive but good steak .
we will be coming back for sure .
very big portions and delicious .

i do n't know why people eat here .
i came for lunch with <UNK> f .
it was really good .
did i mention the bread and broth were delicious ?
it was literally one whole hour .

it gets crazy busy on the weekends .
oh the prices are also great !
the dessert was good .
if you are ever in albuquerque go to <UNK> !
i loved this one .
definitely would come her again : - rrb -
they did n't <UNK> it at all !
the queso is also very delish !
great place to say i do !
i would definitely recommend this company .
"spiced breading , a fab sauce , so tender !"
how can you mess up chicken strips ?
was in today and it was excellent as always !
"nothing amazing ... hard cookies , okay ice cream ."
wo n't be back .
"no surprises , not disappointed ."
"great place for lunch , so so for dinner ."
"the rooms were nice , design was space efficient ."
i always need to charge my phone while traveling .
get some cocktail shrimp .
she did n't even clean up the mess .
eh i just did n't like this hotel .
"plus , all of the rolls were so-so ."
easily one of my favorite places !
it is mostly juggling acts .
it was n't even worth getting my money back .
"thank you , thank you !"
. you have to wait in some more lines .
will return again and again !
what a pleasant surprise !
definitely a must try !
the pool is gorgeous though !
i was just stuffed .
the mushroom i got was decent .
i love this place !
the meat is always lean and perfectly cooked .
i told her grilled and tossed .
<UNK> ' s is a refreshing option !
the jalapenos were fresh and perfect !
i loved the atmosphere and music .
my boyfriend ordered the burger .
the ambiance is wonderful and the menu is mouthwatering .

quite disappointed in this place .
"other than that , fantastic food !"
we ordered the smoked nuts ... oh my !
that ' s how we asians roll .
it was super yum .
": - rcb - so , hi !"
the food and drinks are delicious !
our wait time was over an hour with reservations .
do n't even bother looking at the menu .
the best part was the dessert section .
so much food and so many choices !
great trip to canyon !
"now , onto the food and service !"
we had a very delightful experience .
do n't tell just anyone .
it has ice in it !
i would come back just for those .
always a smile on their faces .
they have the best cosmo ' s on earth .
"i love the potatoes , and the fruit ."
it ' s an enchilada place !
i had the carnitas tacos which were yummy .
this place is awesome ! ! !
there was a line waiting for smoothies .
the music was also strangely un vegas like .
one of our favorite ethnic restaurants !
one thing : the parking is dodgy .
the michelada was good and the shrimp were delicious .
"it was clean , and comfortable ."
server was so friendly !
we ordered the portobello mushroom sandwich .
it definitely hit the spot for me .
we thought we had a really legit place !
we asked for a few minutes more .
how does that even happen simultaneously ?
the interior architecture was actually quite beautiful .
how can there be such a good chilly made ?
"also , the berry smash lemonade is tasty ."
the potatoes could be better .
i went last night which was a sat .
"a classy , enjoyable one ."
"it was n't bad , it was n't great ."
and it ' s not exactly cheap .
. but if this doesnt get fixed .
all of which is truly delicious and devoured .
"decor , great , loved it ."
and the water pressure is ridiculous !
these bagels are delicious !
apple and pear crisp for dessert .
and it was $ 00 .
before and after putting our food together .
at <UNK> i ' m always trying something new .
favorite breakfast place in old town .
the drive to the hotel was not scenic .
"over all , this was a good time !"
jason was very <UNK> with bringing out our drinks .
. the vegetables were stale also .
no longer in my rotation .
my bran muffin was ok .
i really think they have the best strawberry gelato .
i ' m never eating here ever .
ranch on point too !
"thank you so much , flower hut ! !"
not the best that i tasted .
we got beef sausage as our 0rd meat .
we ordered the cornbread which was awesome !
they both tasted the same : like water .
he helped me acquire some by ordering cases .
both of us truly enjoyed the food .
i absolutely loved the dish that i had .
we all enjoyed our selections .
they just do n't go together .
the bread was good as well .
definitely not life changing .
i could <UNK> on just those two .
"three strikes and you ' re out , <UNK> ."
i was really disappointed at this place .
carol usually takes telephone calls .
and pick up here ... .
the staff are friendly and welcoming .
you really ca n't beat that .
then everything would be perfect .
a complete waste of time !
i would definitely recommend this place .
omg the island hospitality !
this place is adorable .
i really wanted to like this place .
they do n't open the doors until 0 .
- even after we paid for the bigger one .
oh the luxor ... the service was decent .
the service was prompt and courteous though .
and the pizza : seriously good .
hopefully she ' s gone by now .
i personally prefer the mild original pho broth .
maybe we can up it to 0 next time .
"good selection of cocktails , wines , and bubbles ."
once seated we were greeted right away .
<UNK> offers quite a few vegetarian options .
i found the food to be very blah .
but it is delicious !
so i had no idea what to expect .
so i just stuck with it .
have i had better ?
not too sweet and super fresh .
just to top everything off .
to get ready for bed .
i would highly recommend this place to anyone .
it is always made to perfection .
burnt ends not crispy / crunchy at all !
the meat was sweet and just <UNK> beautifully .
i definitely recommend the patatas bravas .
i was really curious at this point .
i just love this store .
i ' m sure i will be back .
it was classy and the people were so awesome !
"our server , michelle , was delightful and attentive ."
i ' d definitely go back for another concert .
the laundromat is spacious and clean !
aside from the terrible service the food was decent .
i would definitely recommend it .
they are pretty speedy too .
i di n't like bob ' s dish either .
looking forward to trying the lemon pepper .
we also ordered mojitos and caesars .
i ' m not normally a buffet fan .
in one word ... yum !
"` ` excuse me , miss ?"
it was pretty good .
i had really big dreams for lunch today ... .
fries greasy and customer service poor .
the wings were amazing but were definitely spicy .
"yummy slushy alcohol drinks with peach rings , yum !"
i really do like <UNK> .
the bartender is phenomenal .
i ' m not even exaggerating !
the <UNK> soup ... coconut flavor was yum .
pretty good food and atmosphere .
so why the three stars ?
dd does a great job waxing .
a big plate of food was just 00 bux .
"for $ 000 , we where extremely disappointed !"
and i will be spreading the bad word .
sam fox does it again !
i did n't exactly try their sushi .
this is was cooked to perfection .
"pancakes were equally fluffy , and flavorful ."
the <UNK> board was good but again not impressive .
the bread pudding was a delight !
and my caesar salad was also horrible .
"overall , not too shabby and pretty sweet location ."
i just sighed as i wrote that .
no juices this time .
great customer service and employees .
their pad see ew is the best !
i have been going to this gym since november .
"i ' ll be back , for sure !"
it was so good !
thank you so much !
everything is good that i have ordered so far .
service is very attentive .
my husband loves meat .
my friend and i went for the seafood .
they will give you cash or trade .
"and the fries , fresh cut ."
i was not as impressed with the main .
up first ... pretzel bread .
we would like to go back for brunch .
the staff are super sweet and friendly !
we immediately felt welcomed .
whoever heard of hot wings with no blue cheese ?
the waffles has bacon bits in it !
especially if you like local businesses rather than panda .
i made a face and bolted out the door .
he got the cheese quesadillas and the pesto pasta .
i love the hotels .
gripe # 0 : the atmosphere was icky .
keep it for an entire week .
the scallion pancakes are the best !
ca n't say enough about this place !
all i have to say is <UNK> .
their desserts and pastries looked amazing !
i still think about that just mmmm .
definitely a great starter before the main show .
but maybe it was just a bad batch .
so glad we came back and tried this place !
. its <UNK> for that .
i ' m definitely adding square to brunch rotation .
the steak salad is delicious .
i already ca n't wait ! !
they were very nice about it .
these are the best cupcakes i have ever had .
i love this place .
the worst experience i ' ve ever had .
this place is all right .
love their outdoor patio .
the guacamole and chips here is $ 00 .
i had the goat cheese scramble on toast .
i absolutely love <UNK> .
it has become a go to on our rotation .

we walked into a clean room .
horrible wipe down job inside & out !
i would absolutely call <UNK> in the future .
"not well known , but amazing food and experience !"
the music is very fun too !
the guacamole was so authentic !
though i expect that will occur shortly .
i ' ve been here tons of times .
nice sushi roll restaurant just near the library .
i bought the challah bread and the chocolate brioche .
they told me they took it off my check .
it was equally delicious .
it was a good night .
will not stay anywhere else !
the hostess should not be in customer service .
no extensions have live <UNK> tried them all .
plus it ' s always really busy .
the highlight tho was the crepe .
"it is a dish of fantastic , cheesy <UNK> ."
waste of my lunch break .
he said my gums were in good shape .
"so i went to vegas , first stop lv !"
but you got ta love the free internet .
it had a very romantic ambience .
i didnt know what to say !
the scallops were perfectly done and a good size .
the best was the burrito - it was stellar !
love it love it love it .
would i be back ?
so much flavor and so unique !
is n't this your job ?
<UNK> was filled with spinach but not cheese .
do n't bring you car here !
but it was good .
very good sushi ... on a buffet even !
not worth the line or time .
they usually have really good specials too .
their boba is always at the right consistency .
the rooms are so spacious !
one of our favorite places !
"also , their prices seemed high ."
it ' s kid friendly in the dining area .
i can tell the oyster was n't fresh .
"actually , i always get mine to-go ."
so we got referred to another specialist .
the staff was super friendly .
: it ' s pretty spicy !
all were just divine !
many people / performers on the street dressed up .
they have my business for life .
not recommended : eggs .
it was always worth the wait for a table .
the entire back patio was full tables and umbrellas .
and there ' s free coffee in the morning !
it smelled awful out there .
it had the appropriate amount of seasoning and spice .
but the food is worth it .
loved the decor and the modern features .
we had quite the spread in front of us .
check this place out if you have n't already .
everything i have ever tried has been wonderful !
perfect balance of sour / sweet / spicy .
i had the spicy noodles with chicken .
and spencer was super nice ! !
at least put larger chunks of lobster pieces .
i heard their summer hours close at 0pm .
"either way , cut it out !"
best burger i ' ve ever had .

they ' re all good !
the $ 0 side salad was lovely .
the menu was everything delicious .

the joint is very eclectic !

"<UNK> , illy is ill !"

it was pretty dark !
so i pick it up ... it falls apart .
that ' s too much .
i love this hotel .

the service at brunch yesterday was the worst .
they deserve 0 stars in my opinion .
it was such a delight to use this airport .
i ca n't believe it !
what a waste of time and money !
"i love , love , love this place !"
wait a week and it will be on sale .
just tried their black bean burger .
the waiter not once asked how our food was .
do not sign up with any lvac .
they ' ll bring it to you !
not too much talking .
our bartender bryan was ok .
i was very happy with the service too .
it was n't good .

i have n't seen <UNK> josh here yet .
i love this place .

hard to remember anything in tijuana actually .
i love thai me up .
they played good music too .
of course an inca cola !
good gluten free dining option .
i love vintner grill .
my repairs were over 0k !
and here they are generous with both .
it ' s pretty snazzy inside !
i keep reading great things about the food .
lines were 00-00 people deep .
i rarely eat them .
i even order extra crab in my omelet .
this place is n't here anymore !
shake shack really is bomb dot com !
enjoying the pineapple sorbet at the moment .
we ordered a bottle of red zinfandel .
meat was falling off the bone .
the movers worked hard and very fast .
we definitely should have tried this place sooner !
the mac n cheese was really just ok .
the food i ordered was delish .
and it was n't very sweet either .
enjoyed our first time in .
fast / nice - but down to business .

and she was not the receptionist .
"for example , i ordered the beef tacos ."
we had the tiramisu for dessert !
i love this wonderful spot !
everything always seems fresh and clean .
"as expected , my dog ate the nibbles ."
we shared a bunch of starters .
the portions are tiny and very overpriced .

sweet potatoes gross also yummy .
i gave two stars for the view .
the bartender came out and took our order .
came to this place with a big group .
josh is wow ... amazing !

the mojitos were on special and were delicious .
the waitress was not patient .
they gave us a big texas welcome !

it was just blah .
this place was pretty fantastic .
the fries were pretty good - definitely tasty .
the food is so delicious though !
what a nice touch !
appetizer : tamales and the vegan sushi .
our server was very apologetic about the wait .
too many to mention all .
i think they are overpriced for what you get .
the food is fresh and delicious .
the walls at our booth were filthy .
our room was not great .
there are lots of people here always .
boy were we wrong !
will i be able to find the spa now ?
"heart heart , ex oh ex oh ."
everything looks really cute .
upstairs the atmosphere is decidedly chill and not creepy .
then it had strawberries and chocolate drizzled on top .
they also do alterations .
cute little italian restaurant at 00th ave and 000 .
creamy and satisfying - rrb - .
i just stepped back in time and place .
a beautiful place to stop by and explore !
with a worse view .
<UNK> i do n't think so .
i give them zero star .
it basically has it all !
the shipping was awesome !
. now that ' s romance !
"i had a <UNK> darned , always tasty !"
"also , the prices are amazing ."
"bashas , my castle , my kingdom ."
we met a lot of really cool people .
he was out in the parking lot !
clean everytime i go .
price was not worth it .
you can swim or lay out on a chair .
she could n't smile and was super rude .
talk about a rip off !
it was an unpleasant experience .
we sat outside and enjoyed the relaxing beach music .
so extremely disgusted and disappointed in this .
but the flavor is good and they are filling !
got sushi was great !
i was in and out in no time .
meh - i could take it or leave it .
she just wanted to hang out by it .
i ' m not a big fan .
we were seated immediately .
i also had the fried artichokes for an appetizer .
not japanese style at all .
' ' i consider my lesson learned .
we asked them to make our smoothies extra smooth .
kids went and came back empty handed .
much better service over there !
i love their drinks .
definitely worth stopping in if your in the area !
only serve the frothy and fermented .
i had a great experience at this location .
i can not wait to go back !
crappy comforter and springy bed .
refreshing change from the strip .
or else i would clean the plate .
the burritos were all right .
the service also was impeccable .
the cafe is located on the second floor .
aloft offered me points to apologize .
i ordered the chili garlic with brown rice .
bill rocks and made our night .
disappointed ! ! ! do n't come here .
"the room itself was very , very nice ."

which is what is listed in the ingredients .
"umm , so good !"
everyone is always super friendly and greets you .

my husband and i stopped by for lunch today .
wo n't be ordering their dim sum items .
"also , this mall has an aquarium !"
i sh * t you not .
this show was just amazing !
this place hits the spot vegan or not !
it was like drinking gravy .
we sat by the fireplace overlooking the lake .
dinner was subpar tonight .
"harry was honest , clear , and <UNK> ."
we both ordered a soup & sandwich combo .
the market place and starbucks made it very convenient .
they only have soy sauces .
i really liked it .
0.0 to be exact .
moment after the first bite .
everyone on staff is so friendly and helpful .
* * suggestion - hire more workers .
"<UNK> , mommy had a break ."
sweet but not overly so .
drinks dessert very delicious .
this vape shop completely has that wow factor !
the mac & cheese was different this time too !
the buffet - this place was huge !
this place is amazing !
will come back again when we are in town .
not appropriate when customers in lobby .
i frequently get take out .
you ' re lucky to have him .
i complained on deaf ears .
i have had four bad experiences now .
"at this time , our table was ready ."
this was a perfect amount of food .
the price just seems to keep rising .
the service is quick and fast and very attentive .
she was truly wonderful .
we finished our salads without seeing jeremy .
sadly we did not get dessert .
their happy hour is very impressive !
they have no respect for their customers .
the experience was <UNK> .
i ordered the filet and it was super underwhelming .
"handmade tortillas , smoky salsas ... just great ."
i can verify that he cleaned his plate .
my family loved it .
kobe beef on top ... yum !
definitely a nice hidden gem !
drove back to the office in a hurry .
which actually means ` ` drain your glass .
they definitely exceed in the customer service category .
the inside was bigger than i thought .
they ' d love it .
was here last night around 0:00 pm .
we meet my friend here for her b-day dinner .
now he has to shop like an adult .
the room was spotlessly clean and smelled nice .
the food just was n't good .
so flaky and fantastically delicious !
the workers are very sweet patient people .
i love those nerds !
chicken is really good .
the star was the bacon .
we came back again .
"the facials , pedicures and massages are incredible ."
it was a sunday and it started <UNK> .
"it is spicy , but yumm so good !"
the line / wait outside looked <UNK> !
no one came to check on us .
we ordered pot stickers for the appetizer .
"overall , excellent experience !"
went into our room close to 0pm .
do n't expect anything fantastic .
i would not recommend for anyone to go .
the food & service was good .
the four stars is because the waiter was amazing !
the texas toast is to die for !
need one say more ?
"wow , still waiting for our food ."
"large portions , delicious food , and friendly service ."
but it got better as the show went on .
they explained the menu pretty well .
also got the shrimp tacos and they were great .
"unfortunately , it was drenched in dressing ."
the restaurant decor is very nice .
i love coming here on wednesdays !
everything is ala carte thought .
i probably ate $ 00 worth of desserts .
i always end up getting the chicken <UNK> burrito .
this place is one of my top favorite restaurants .
. our family ' s favorite pizza place .
the rolls are hearty and fresh .
"pine , then licorice , then sweet ."
choreography kept it interesting and costumes were cool .
i fairly enjoyed it since it had nice brands .
. wth ? ! calls back .
best spinach con queso ever !
they have dj spinning all the time .
we thought we were getting in .
you have excellent locations .
great with recommendations for allergies .
"hmmm , probably not ."
i really did n't have a clue .
maybe my expectations were too high ?
under $ 0 bucks !
it was plated beautifully .
he was in so much pain and screamed 00/0 .
"unfortunately , i experienced horrible customer service ."
they take reservations for 0 and over .
the miso soup was delicious .
soft and just the right sweetness .
even their pastas are amazing for a deli .
it is busy but well worth the wait !
lots of options and attentive staff .
i believe his name was mike .
"the food is authentic , fresh , and outstanding !"
yummy with healthy italian / mediterranean type food .
the prices are also very reasonable .
the taste was ok .
00 + $ for a glass ?
<UNK> made every aspect of the apartment search easy .
this is a horrible company .
i could n't resist !
i ' ll definitely go back .
it ' s expensive - but worth it .
it ' s not terrible .
it ' s delicious and filling .
need i say more ?
"if in the strip , you must stop in !"
quite a few minutes later the latte came .
and the food is awesome !
"haha , i had no complaints about it ."
john was extremely friendly and welcoming .
i still dream of deep friend oreos ... <UNK> .
the food i did end up sampling was good .
it was so yummy .
ca n't wait to go back .
the shoe repairs were done very well .
finally got our food about 00 minutes later .
this restaurant is worth getting off the strip .
the people are down-to-earth and very friendly .
i feel appreciated and welcomed !
"needless to say , we left in <UNK> ."
and the service is always impeccable !
and like i ' ve said before .
it has everything you could ever imagine .
and do n't forget to put the silk <UNK> .
"great food , fun atmosphere ."
will be back but only drive thru .
not very authentic at all .
spacious patio and sit down inside seating .
expensive is not necessarily better !
- rrb - great place to dine !
tuna carpaccio : i thought this was pretty good .
"also , the tom yum soup is really good ."
"the seafood was good , except the shrimp ."
we ordered curry and pad thai .
i love the whole office .
brandon was awesome - very professional and knowledgeable .
"oh how i love you , le thai ."
i would probably come back just for her service .
ca n't be beat especially coming from the valley .
the biltmore has long lacked a decent coffee place .
:-p it was good .
the service was pretty bad .
the best i ' ve ever had .
"but , that ' s ok ."
i attended last saturday night .
it was a welcome respite from the snowy cold .
we used a groupon coupon .
"it was okay , i guess ."
it ' s really a shame .
"they were professional , friendly , kind and understanding ."
the service was the hang up .
. she made experience fun enjoyable .
we were walking around downtown phoenix in the heat .
love that they give you sopapillas .
i really enjoyed it .
"heck , we didnt ever get a smile ."
the night could n't get better !
their spicy korean chicken plate is the best .
just go try it .
the bathrooms are a bit grimy .
the food is just meh .
do n't know how to smile either .
mcdonald ' s has free wi-fi .
i really like the food here .
this atmosphere reminded me of a club .
for starters their margaritas are fresh .
unfortunately i introduced this location to my fiancã © .
i was puking all day .
however many more you need for that extra kick !
who know i would like carrot top .
and i love the guacomole ... mmmmm .
i want this for breakfast every day .
i do n't think i would stay here again .
i just know i want it again !
save room for dessert !
loved the veggie pizza .
- rrb - and a light citrus sauce .
"overall , i was impressed with the hotel itself ."
today i went in and the food was horrible .
a very good greek restaurant with tasty food .
i really might go up to 0 stars .
three of us all ordered blt .
i got the quiche which was huge .
i ' m so disappointed .
our second visit and this time we brought friends !
but i didnt listen to myself .
she moved to the chair across the table .
"the cilantro margarita is good , too ."
their burgers are small .
and <UNK> are memories worth making !
a mix of couples and families .
had a great experience at this location .
it was weird but a good weird !
i first called and spoke with amanda .
i barely tried anything in this buffet .
lots of room and chairs so not a problem .
it was pretty good .
the huge sundaes were delicious .
this store is so unorganized .
super annoying considering it ' s a nice place .
the library of movies available for rental was decent .
i also love the ambience .
i was so relaxed !
i had been told there was a cleaning fee .
i always get the same thing .
it is really a piece of heaven .
can you ask for more ?
we love this place !
the whole atmosphere is adorable !
i think i only ate half of mine .
they sent us home with 0 handmade truffles .
both are nicely lit up with changing colored lights .
when we got it we were disappointed .
they ca n't even make a simple turkey sandwich .
the bed was heavenly .
our truck was clean and ready when we arrived .
the restaurant has an incredible view !
i came here on a groupon .
dessert did look delicious .
their food is average .
the food is delicious .
"smelly , dirty and very small ."
i would highly recommend ! !
just do your research and hope for the best !

i love the margarita flatbread and arancini !
. will not be going back .
follow up appointments for my <UNK> .
i love this little car wash .

it has a dark cozy feel .
the garlic cheese bread was delicious !
we came here for my husbands birthday dinner .
it did not fit the concept .
my options when we got there ?
it was definitely my favorite appetizer .
the decor is humble and eclectic .

"the service ... slow , inattentive and impersonal ."
we started out with some yummy starters .
it is so accessible .

do n't waste your time or money here .
i am in love with their red sangria .

"ahh , mesa grill , how i love thee !"

he went over the menu and explained everything .
way better deals than other nutrition stores .
' ' i got so excited .
i would go back in a heartbeat !
the servers were really catering too .
the bread - <UNK> !
the property : lots to do here .
totally chill and awesome .
i highly recommend a visit !
"service was super , super nice !"
it was definitely amazeballs !
"the dancing , choreography and staging was beautifully executed ."
full of attitude by teenagers .
the restaurant is small !
maybe 0 bags of chips .
gina ' s is a small but delightful restaurant .
i will be back very soon again for lunch !
<UNK> was super helpful in getting our night arranged .
we devoured the bread .
we got the garlic mashed potatoes as a side .
the servers were good and very friendly .
they have a good variety of flavors and toppings .
i also got the taro chips .
very low key and casual vibe .
"pomegranate wheat beer , yes please !"
the bed was huge with very comfortable bedding .
"the macaroons were okay , again , too sweet ."
at this price point .
love the eggplant with garlic .
that was great customer service .
"portions are very filling , i sometimes have leftovers ."
enjoyed the omg burger .
the ye ' <UNK> <UNK> tasted plain and flavorless .
we finished eating and received our bill .
the garlic mash was creamy and flavorful .
was in the mood for banana whipped cream pie .
that is always a huge plus imo .
"if you go on a sunday , forget it ."
i loved the steak .
they automatically added the gratuity .
so it ' s definitely hit or miss . .
el chorro is my favorite spot for sunday brunch !
hardly any healthy options .
i had a wedding to do this past weekend .
everything is made there .
warning to parents & families !
. and still are .
on to the french toast .
they were fun and entertaining .

bob is the best !
pretty standard dim lighting and caribbean decor .

friendly staff and nice place !
if you just need cheap drinks .
i would definitely recommend this place to everyone !
the costumer service ... <UNK> !

customer service is key for me .
i was really pleased with the adoption process !
he greeted me at the door .
my tough reviewing husband was enthralled .
i had the tutti frutti waffles .
why did we eat here you ask ?
both doctors truly care about their patients .
and the fries were hot and crispy .
literally everything about our meal was awful .
the staff is always so upbeat and happy .
there is only one shared lot .
we were in and out in 0 minutes .
i will definitely be frequenting this wonderful place !
"everything is so fresh , natural , beautiful ."
it ' s pricey but worth it !
their were promo girls too offering free shots .
"~ everything is new , cool , and trendy ."
this place is amazing !
could n't have asked for a better experience .
all items were fresh .
we came on sunday to check out the event .
steam filled the air .
it has about 0-0 tables - lrb - ?
"however , they were only $ 00 ."
"also , we ate inside , not outside ."
our server was a newbie .
had everything and more stuffed inside .
the squash casserole is so good !
i know i ' m a bit snobbish .
either way we finished everything .
i will no longer visit this establishment .
you should know where .
i never have a bad time here .
never had a bad dish .
so maybe this place is n't so bad .
i plan to head there often for vegan tuesday !
love love love this restaurant .
they definitely made my birthday as <UNK> as possible .
such great fresh food .
we need healthy places in vegas desperately .
need i say more ?
the spice might not be for everyone .
i am a recent lux convert .
you wo n't be disappointed !
there is no luxury bedding .
i just wish they served rice with the gyro !
like i said ... the food is yum .
they have great service and fast delivery .

we wait some more .
we all were very disappointed .
they absolutely deserve a 0 star !
the food sucked at umc .

it was peer pressure !
"note , their cajun spicy fish is super spicy ."
we decided to get a drink at the bar .
i did not think it looked that great .
called the manager the next day .
i love this place .
. probably because it is just too busy .
there should have been no charge .
my husband had one and he loved it .
the fries were delicious - perfectly cooked and seasoned .
maybe they were just having an off night ?
options available for picky children .

"additional plus , they were quick with orders ."
easy access to the front desk / our room .

i do know one thing .
at least it ' s not dated and dingy .
i live in a fairly small house .
of course i would !
little pricey but so good !
dirty tables in the dining room are the norm .
i have enjoyed lunch at their denver location .
"however , i really enjoyed my food ."
this was n't <UNK> duck .

"if ya have n't been , go ."
the front staff was wonderful .
i especially liked the frog legs !
i did n't know my screen could be fixed .
"my ceviche was awesome , especially with the avocado ."
they have a lot of happy hour deals too .
restaurant is located inside the hotel .
so we ended up parking the car ourselves .
it ' s just ` ` pancake syrup .
it tastes very fresh .
. plus the lady that works there is awesome !
her <UNK> is hands down the best in town .
"for <UNK> , this is a great grocery store ."
there is so much to take in and order !
it ' s very limiting to vegetarians .
not worth the line at all !
atmosphere : it ' s pretty spacious .
a floral decoration of 00 purple closed <UNK> .
the rooms are update with very comfortable modern <UNK> .
nachos <UNK> high with all kinds of stuff 0 .
nice salads with tomatoes that have actual flavor !
went tonight on a recognition and was horribly disappointed .
service was snooty and slow .
enjoy the bird <UNK> !
he only had the aioli <UNK> .
how unsafe is that ?

my favorite restaurant in las vegas .
capo ' s was an interesting experience .
i was also a little disappointed in the accompaniments .
there were about 00 of us .
my husband and i split a pizza .
i have had them all .
he did so well for being his first time .
do yourself a favor and check this place out !
would have been amazing if the music was live .
i guess we could all have used a mimosa .
i feel like the prices are very realistic .
. they better be right !
all of the sushi was fresh and delicious .
i met some old friends there .
everything seemed like it was going very well !

it was supposed to be a wonderful thing .
i will definitely be ordering again soon .
they have adult ice cream !
this was so cool !
thoroughly enjoyed my drink .
"if you like cider , try the pineapple !"
still staff was nice and attentive .
"' ' umm ... okay , i got it ."
she was doing everything .
the food itself was eh .
shampoo is not chemical free !
desserts were totally not mediterranean .
i wo n't be back there either .
the pharmacy staff is amazing .
the meat was flavorless .
so we came back and again just okay .
had a great dinner at blue last week .
so so so so so boring .
he was polite and timely .
this was the perfect size for us .
no crushed tomato sauce .
large pool / lounge area .
"at 0: 00 , my driver called ."
the desserts also are so delicious .
that grossed me out .
in a way ... .
the few items that we got were tasty .
we were fortunate to have nice weather .
$ 0 cold sake bottles !
"normally , i ' m not a pizza person ."
we did n't think it was <UNK> .
fabulous freddie ' s is truly fabulous !
you wo n't be disappointed .

it ' s very similar to cheesecake factory .
we waited in line for about 00 minutes .
i ' ll never order from here again .
a cute little vinyl shop with something for everybody .
i would never use again .
service had been ok .
the coleslaw was tasteless .
their rosemary toast is also to die for !
it was really nice inside .
still good little place !
the first being a few years ago .
"and last by not least , the service !"
i would totally recommend this hotel .
perfect place for day drinking .
i am so glad i did !
so there ' s that .
flavors are good enough for me to come back .
this restaurant is a lot of fun !
my friend ordered the <UNK> and meatballs .
amazing location with fantastic views of camelback mountain 0 .
"to start , we shared an appy of oysters ."
"really nice , clean , friendly atmosphere ."
"this was my first taste of tapas , ever ."
yummy in my tummy .
i split cucumber sandwich with a friend .
cranberry scone emerald spinach salad - i add mushrooms .
the menu is huge and overwhelming .
the food was n't all that .
the dude is hilarious !

"- lrb - yes , i just went there ."
a new favorite place for me !
food menu really doesnt impress me enough to try .

worst experience at a restaurant ever .
dad got one of the veggie burgers .
i do n't need jewelry or show related souvenirs .

interior decor i find quite pleasing .

we got there around 0-00 am every morning .

"homemade breads , bagels , and pastries ."
she was firm and quiet the entire time .

all in good time !
it was better before the second spot opened .
the grounds constantly have pet <UNK> .
worth the drive out of the strip !
service is amazing too .
"so please , excuse me if i sound <UNK> ."
do n't even bother .
fried wonton = chips .
you get the quality you are paying for .

i just ca n't not order pho though .
the chicken was overcooked .
his prices are reasonable especially for the generous cuts .
the selection is perfect !
a 0 hour wait ?

i hope they correct that .
i ate in the name of science .

this place is cute !
i highly recommend working with this company .
he is a wonderful doctor and a kind man .
my boyfriend ordered the rib eye .
he responded promptly to every communication and concern .
the food however was a different story .
this restaurant is my new favorite breakfast place .

"this is a small , intimate venue ."
best sandwich in town by far !
overall bad service and the food was not good .
i was in love .
this was our first time experiencing korean bbq .
the bar service was awful .
over priced for the amount and quality .
thank goodness didnt get picked on .
great place for a shopping day : - rrb -
bar looked fun and drinks were creative .
and they let us play for free .
we all decided to have the brunch .
nobody would ever go in the pool .
the space is not laid out well .
but it was really worth it !
at first this place kind of threw us off .
the clients were truly homeless living on the street .
as did the taco and enchilada .
so thanks for nothing !
"also , the weight situation is very unsafe ."
it was clean and the staff was very friendly .
"during nicer weather , guests sit on the terrace ."
i really enjoy this theater and its location .
my scallops were just as good .
and by extra veggies they put on more lettuce .
to each their own .
i thought everyone was very friendly and professional .
glad it ' s close to home !
how boring by comparison !
- lrb - wait can i ?
i did appreciate her concern .
we were there for dinner on a monday night .
hell even showering was painful .
"so , that ' s my story ."
i absolutely love this place .
"the calamari was lightly batter , which i like !"
"when i arrived , no one was there ."
my companions had the grilled salmon and the chicken .
it was worth at least giving it a try !
we will definitely be using you again .
0 star for the cans of 0000s deodorant powder .
i ' m so glad we did !

i felt so embarassed for him .
hours just slip by .

i would definitely get this next time .
but it was very delicious !
i started with the fresh rolls .
happy hour and non happy hour .
the rice was perfect for me .
it was on a sat night .

not much to complain about here .
seafood tasted fresh and perfectly cooked .
i especially like the mayo !
the salsa was really good .
"sleek , clean and comfortable ."

it was pretty crowded .
it was actually disgusting .
the staff are friendly and helpful .
the food is fun !
ca n't wait to go back !
the play area is huge !
totally worth the $ 000 + ticket !
i highly recommend that dish .
we tasted all of them and was n't impressed .
definitely in love with the frozen hookah ... yum .
i think taco bells are more generous ... .
"omg , soooo freaking good ."
dined here last friday night .
you must give it a try !
00 beers steps away from my house ?
so disappointed in this store .
"and the seasoning , hot n juicy in medium ."
"quite a waste of money , considering how pricey ."
this place is gross .
not sure if it was water or crafted drink .
only warning is the portions are <UNK> !
joshua was very helpful and welcoming .
love it and will always come back .
the technician was very unfriendly .
the must have here is their <UNK> .
she even got splitting the checks correct .
smh freakin ' awesome shop !
it ' s small and cozy on the inside .
the food tasted authentic .
there was a lot in there .
but it ' s a no-frills experience .
"overall , the hotel is beautiful ."
"no , i ' m not jewish ."
both were really good .
cheese was hard and not enough .
mainly because they pretty much catered to his rims .
everyone seemed to enjoy it .
<UNK> soup and salad combo .
everything else was just ... so-so .
we showed up around 0:00 ... .
he tried reaching over me .
"in short , we wo n't be returning ."
we tried to be patient .

the owner has quite the personality .

they have what every other discount department store has .
it was so very themed and so very vegas .
we were seated immediately .
tea was exceptionally good and muffin was homemade .
very glad i did .
not just serving microwave meals or cold sandwiches .
it ' s has unique and creative dishes .
"<UNK> , is it nice !"
"military discount , kids menu otherwise standard mexican restaurant ."
awesome theatre in a great location !
do n't tell too many people !
and do n't get me started on the food !
otherwise a total disappointment .
i do n't have one bad thing to say !
staff is friendly and the drinks are good .
she just butt in for no reason !
but this one changed my opinion .
the bread was freshly baked and fluffy .
"i hate horchata , but this concoction was amazing ."
the chicken taco was fine as was the flan .
the service and food was great !
it was my place .
good serving sizes too !
the food was delicious ?
they really ruined the nachos .
get me my pink <UNK> !
it ' s just okay for me .
i would go back again .
every ` ` act ' ' is the same .
i am a fan !

the toffee is amazing !
my husband had linguine with crab meat .

it could have been corrected .
"its tasty and free , ca n't go wrong !"

my favorite part of the whole meal .

nice and modern decor as well .
"it was tender , juicy and flavorful ."
told me to wait .
i will be back .
"<UNK> , the owner is so nice and sweet !"
"damn , you turkey !"
"best service , their wontons are amazing !"
no more lunch hours .

this is great and this is horrible !
they really listen and use feedback .
so he can have high payments & interest rate ?
food was okay ... was not blown completely away .
the food is n't bad !
syrup made the toast very sweet .
i am sooooo angry !
we actually did have time for breakfast .
<UNK> for the win !
<UNK> and his staff are awesome !
<UNK> i frequent <UNK> almost on a weekly basis .

i could n't believe it .
i thought the salmon rolls were delicious .
"if i could give 0 stars , i would ."
you will be full .
the basil rolls were really good as well .
completely different from the starbucks i go to .
plus the little plastic cups just seemed wasteful .
we were the only ones waiting to be seated .
"holy shawarma , batman !"
what an unexpected surprise .
the hotel it self is super worn out .
great place to shop !
"so i went , hesitant ."
we enjoyed the sangria at the happy hour .
my new favorite local sushi place .
did n't fix it .
the only item that went array was the eggplant .
"that aside , i absolutely love these classes ."
"room was very spacious , very clean ."
this stuff could be addictive !
"oh heck yeah , i was sold !"
it was pretty good except the soup was cold .
today was a good day !
they have an amazing deal for lunch .
"she keeps pushing , i continue saying no ."
"the ravioli was fine , but nothing special ."
there is not a bountiful selection for vegetarians .
their classes are addicting .
this location is great .

the location is cute and they have free wifi .
we will definitely be back .

best oysters rockefeller we ' ve ever had .
"after 0 days , we stopped in the store ."

had to try it just for fun .
"for dessert , we shared the tiramisu ."
my favorite thing was the pool and spa .
they were very friendly and quick .

the staff are amazing .
our waitress was nice and attentive .
my friend and i both got our own salads .
we tried chile addiction and it was awesome .
their staff was very friendly .
it is pretty pricey for what you get .
"i repeat , cheesy grits ."
"no meat , no seasoning , no nothing ."
i was very pleased with the customer service
they have to make do with what they have .
swanky yet laid back vibe .
one of my favorite places ! ! ! but !
he stated he could .
i could live off of the potato puree .
the crowd was ok .
"my meal was okay , but not fantastic ."

' ' i wish i spoke up .
they give you so much food .
sorry other yelpers who love this location much more .
i accidentally erased the replies from kiss mini golf .
tried : california burrito - the tortilla was amazing .
it can probably fit 0-0 people comfortably !
overall mediocre with all tried food combined .
my husband very much enjoyed his margarita pizza .
just a personal preference thing for sure .
the plus here is the service .
we stayed in the world tower .
"not to shabby at all , sauce !"
best <UNK> decor so far !
i wont be back .

the restaurant was roomy and had a lively vibe .
the benefits of working with desiree exceed sleep .

i had a very pleasant experience with this company .
this review is just for the pools .
we could not be happier .

"i love , love cherry berry ."
"perfectly seasoned , perfect serving , it was bomb ."
i like the simple cheese .
the bartenders were super nice .

"yup , their dessert is that good !"
a day here takes away all my worries .
the staff is nice .

they had no real flavor .
and the veggie stack was amazing .
"yes , it ' s pricey ."

might have broken a fire code .
the decor is stunning - very mod .

i really like the palazzo .

the staff did not rush us at all .
but that ' s just me .
and we were out of there .
i was very impressed with the staff .
but my favorite is absolutely <UNK> ' s .
that i thought was a little reckless .
"quality products , will definitely come back ."
i highly recommend this restaurant to everybody !
they have fantastic prices and quick service .
"funny , but not too funny ."
we paid nearly $ 00 .
00.00 plus tax on a monday night dinner .
i ' m still grossed out by it .
"i mean , it was good !"
next we ordered the $ 00 burger .
"they have a jukebox , too !"
i love bar food !
and all for so cheap !
we will be back to try everything .
and yes the salads are great too .
the options are endless !
takes forever to get your order .
night and day difference !
it was cold and rubbery .
"as can be expected , the chocolate was yummy ."
the bistro was really charming though .
so that was an already added bonus .
we were greeted and seated quickly as we entered .
there was the standard salsa and spicy .
<UNK> you get there .
i ' ve always liked going outback .
portions were massive and it made for great <UNK> .
parking - blah but worth the walk !
laundry facilities on each floor .
do n't think about it just go .
daily newspaper is available .

the noodles also seemed different and undercooked .
our waiter was very helpful and nice and attentive .
more trendy options for all ages .
the service was good .
the sushi here was amazing .
we did enjoy our boat ride though .
i was so thrilled !
the mix lounge is fantastic .
they made us feel like family !
mango daiquiri for $ 0.00 cad 0 .
no wonder there were ninja moves in between .
' ' and i was right !

i think you pay for the quality .
so it was good .
it was just ok .
our very own urban winery !
it was n't busy at all ... .
this is were this <UNK> is located .
"but at half the price , it should n't ."
i also loved the dipping sauces .
the decor was cute and the servers were nice .
but it did n't matter anyway .
both are so delicious .
ca n't wait to come back !
a little tacky i would say .
once again green comes through with fantastic vegan fare !
i will definitely be a frequent customer .
the chocolate chip cookies are delicious too !
' ' they were just so blah and unfriendly .
that ' s 0 days of goodness left !
was not disappointed whatsoever .
they have regular and mini sizes .
owner was so nice and checking on us !
i ' ll admit it .
ate here for the first time tonight .
the sushi chef was funny and knowledgeable .
"all divine , and all different types of flavor ."
perhaps they were having a bad day or something .
they arrived on time and were so nice .
very pleased that i checked out this place .
we wo n't return .
yes ear infection but wrong medication .
i ordered the chicken entree and really enjoyed it .
i am on my lunch break afterall .
it reminds me of a dream prom haha .
my dining companion had the mushroom quesadilla .
so ... go there instead .
not a term we used for him at xmas !
the flowers were n't very desirable looking .
i would n't go anywhere else !
also hot so at least we got that part .
the best fried rice that we have ever had !
we shall see how they do next time .
"no lines , clean theaters and clean restrooms ."
and to curse at me was unacceptable .
"0 good meals , one awful !"
the exact same thing happened to me .
all of the food is delicious and fresh .
"room was clean , spacious ."
not to be missed !
returned for lunch during break at work .
i asked them to leave off the rice .
i would return to try more .
the mock chicken was also surprisingly yummy .
she comes back and gives everyone the wrong drinks .
i had a good time there !
this place is not incredible !
i ' m posting a photo .
i ' m so in love .
similar to a fancy hot pocket or pot pie .
i got to the room .
the portions were amazing !
worth coming here again to try the other desserts !
place was pretty empty .
we ' ll definitely be back !
"it is small , unassuming , and very homey ."
i give it four stars total .
the crepes are huge !
i was really disappointed .
"tasted fine , poor service"

but it was all good when i got inside .
"what can you say , its an addiction !"
"besides the hawaiian sandwich , i ate the <UNK> !"
the service people were also so helpful .
will never order again .
or have someone take you there on a date .
she also explained that the curry options change daily .
"last i checked , 0.0 x 0.00 is 0.00 ."
the coffee is served in the cutest little cups .
first visit to this restaurant .
great <UNK> that really hit the spot .
the service as well as the food was amazing !
i ' m glad i did .
the food always comes out quick and hot !
el cortez is the cheapest & probably the safest .
o geez ! ! <UNK> please !
french fries were good .
sundubu tastes like water .
never coming here again .
the food was wayyyyy too bland .
pretty good items at the cake and bread area .
- lrb - a band was playing outside .
the smoothies taste sort of like chemicals .
"cheap , cheap , cheap !"
caesar salad to die for .
i would definitely come back .
i watched a bum steal my friends drink .
we only got one piece per person .
just wish there were more variety of stores .
"and we were very , very full ."
what a great show !
"if i could give zero stars , i would ."
my cake was displayed .
no one really came back to check on us .
and it was 00 % off for this discount !
the goat cheese crostini and the garlic knot bread .
the view was amazing .
this is not the hotel to go to .
this place is decorated so fun and bright .
love love love it here !
i ordered the filet mignonette with bacon wrapped scallops .
$ 00 for dinner and $ 00 for lunch .
the garlic fries were fabulous .
we were seated pretty quickly for our lunch visit .
we place our drink orders right away .
my husband loved it .
solid food with trendy vibe .
i believe the kids had a good time .
it shocked me and i was pleasantly surprised .
"yes , red is a flavor ."
"on the side , we ordered a biscuit ."
but i definitely think scramble was worth the drive .
the pulled pork was tender .
the service was impeccable .
we have been here three times .
everything about this hotel is gorgeous .
must be those magical 0000 acoustics .
they are n't equipped to handle any crowds .
highly recommend this school for your children .
"crisp , small little squares seasoned to perfection ."
even worked there for a time .
- rrb - we said yes .
the teachers are great .
my tank was empty before i even hit <UNK> !
wat is my life ?
' ' do n't get me wrong .
i was 00 ... .
it was tasteless & could have been left off .
i need to go back and try them again .
there is something i do n't say often !
two words : prosciutto with brie on focaccia bread .
"charming breakfast , brunch , or lunch spot !"
i regret not having done that .
we stop here whenever we ' re in vegas .
"well , it was too late now ."
"but overall , i recommend the <UNK> !"
simple seasonings but grilling makes anything taste better .
the last time i got up and walked out .
this place is okay .
the building itself is very warm and inviting .
very clean will definitely come again .
i forgot hubby ' s name too .
the sauce lacked any flavor whatsoever .
spilled coffee partially cleaned up .
now that was a sandwich !
i did enjoy the outside patio .
consistently good mexican food in downtown phoenix !
they have daily specials .
- rrb - some people do n't share .
i have never had a disappointing experience .
what a great person and trainer .
always a great experience !
"agreed to be here at 0am today , saturday ."
oh my it was good .
i have to get something i know i like .
"excellent service , horrible food !"
you ca n't go wrong with this place .
"for the conference we w , <UNK> extremely happy ."
yes they make everything convenient .
and i am sorry to say that .
it was amazing and i was mesmerized .
they took my daughters food back to try again .
the lady at the counter was nice though .

review is for sunday brunch only wow !
we actually dined last night with some friends .
"i am sorry , but way overpriced ."
their food is delicious .
my husband loves their lemon tart and opera bars .
i was so annoyed i just walked out .
the potatoes are only ok .
"wait , anything with flat noodles ."
go with our book group so lots of chat .
the service was awful too .
"albeit , i did n't find anything exceptionally good ."
", the employees are always very knowledgeable and helpful !"
felt like a bond girl .
"no , she did not ."
i never do that .
grabbed a snicker doodle cookie to go .
me <UNK> los <UNK> !
"but , it was clean ."
chicken satay was ok .
i ordered the bbq chicken salad for my hubby .
the juice is fresh pressed !
cool place the portions are huge !
there is a joke for everyone in the audience .
had been obviously sitting out a while .
and a little bit <UNK> .
could n't believe it .
my husband had the prime rib sandwich .
the most amazing food i ' ve ever eaten .
they use to be very delicious .
it was just okay .
it was just a boring bowl of lobster pho .
the salad that comes with any entree is awesome !
do n't go here .
looks like it ' s been there awhile .
i enjoyed everything i tried - raw and cooked .
so disappointed - i really wanted to like you .
i had high expectations .
. it was light and crispy .
the entire burger was just so damn good !
i ca n't complain .
i was pretty disappointed .
the room was ok just slightly outdated but clean .
make sure to order the bruschetta for an appetizer !
it was alright but <UNK> .
they ' re pretty amazing .
this is a definite must try place .
i love this salon ! !
too good to not order .
michael was very friendly and respectful !
"they have sandwiches , hot dogs and even pizza ."
and to get ready for the crazy night ahead .
restaurant selection is good for quick bites .
drooling all over again .
it was nice for privacy and people watching .
their bakery is great .
the renovated house is super cute and trendy .
they know their stuff .
it was a wonderful birthday celebration !
"however , it does one thing extremely efficiently ."
vanessa at the bar is just * wonderful * .
i am biased when it comes to <UNK> .
that ' s $ 0 a wings .
"today , we also ordered their potato salad ."
i waited for about 00-00 minutes .
anything else would ' ve been too much food .
there was an artist there painting on the wall .
: - rrb - love this place !
it was fine but not $ 00 fine .
i ordered chicken tikka masala for take out .
the french toast was ok .
they are usually perfectly cooked .
i love this place !

but people give in to it .
i wish they carried the reed <UNK> and oils .
"good , its only 0 ."
the <UNK> reception in here is no good !
stop by if you have n't already .

"now onto the bathroom , there was mold ."
the coffee was good too .
the <UNK> was tender and seasoned to perfection .
we ordered dinner and wine .
"it was decent , but definitely not modern ."
"overall , they have good food ."
it should be a side split between two people .
"which , at 00 cad is a good deal ."
the portion is also filling enough for 0 ppl .
i consistently love this place .
very satisfied for coming to my first karaoke studio .
their sliced sausage is so flavorful !
the line was ridiculously long but moved fairly quickly .
it ' s an adorable set up .
my best college pals - lrb - hi girls !
located right in the lobby of caesars palace .
my one star sticks .
i had an italian and it was very strange .
the decor is regular bar decor .
the service is friendly and efficient .
it had peach <UNK> in it ... a lot !
the cocktails and cold sake were divine as well .
"gym is pretty nice , too ."
cauliflower never had it so good .
our total was almost $ 00 .
the restaurant is quite small and awkwardly situated .
perfectly spiced and the ingredients are fresh !
the beans where meh .
it came with a citrus vinaigrette for dipping .
great food and awesome service !
it was thick and went perfect with the burger !
"visiting from <UNK> , ohio ."

lower budget haunted house but so much fun !
every staff member i encountered was very nice .
in ballantyne so its very convenient .
so i do n't go here for sushi anymore .
lots of variety and good service !
my friend and i had the espresso martinis .
it tasted even worse .
it was the size of a brownie .
tricks has become my latest culinary obsession .
we had 00 people and they sat us immediately .
meat & potatoes has become my saving grace .
the food came out piece by piece .
thanks for your honesty .
i went to a 0:00 movie .
"she was so nice , funny and attentive ."
$ 0 for a slice of pizza .

i got the spicy scrambled eggs with potatoes .
i could n't believe it .

this was fun stuff .
the bread was so flaky and good .
now that did bother me .
who names their salad ` ` garbage ' ' ?
i love the upstairs wine area .
afternoon tea today was nice .
the reason for the 0 stars is the pizza .
service was a little on the slower side .
what a fantastic venue for our downtown phoenix !
really liked this hotel !
this is our favorite place close to the house .

the kid space was the best part .
i tried the kale juice which was delicious ?
i tried this place for the first time today .

i got tuna haha .
"great food , lively atmosphere !"
excellent jacuzzi with strong jets .
what a great place to take your family !

i recommend the veal marsala and meat ravioli .
our waitress seem over worked and under extreme pressure .
often i ' ll ask for extra chimichurri .
i love sitting in here chatting with someone .
recommend the coconut cream pie .
it seemed very unorganized and sloppy .
i can make choices to improve my health naturally .

the mac and cheese was tasty and creamy .

i will give them yet another try soon .
i guess i missed that part .

"<UNK> , i have seen the light !"
cute little cafe facing parc la <UNK> .
my wallet fell victim every time .
the food is always artfully played and delicious .
their menu is written with <UNK> tiles .
calorie counters - stay away from this soup !
"overall , the food was good !"
"nevertheless , i enjoyed my meal and was stuffed ."
"for the money , you get a lot ."
super moist and garlicky !
the atmosphere was cold and unwelcoming .
"nothing to write home about , but tasted fine ."
that was not my question .

i had the 0oz filet mignon which was delish .
you will be so glad you got up early !

00 days later - guess what ?
a special blend made in house .
he did n't care .
we had no bites prior to the flight .
good date night place !
this was n't worth the money at all .
"muffin was good , too ."
so much there still had tags from the stores !
i called to inquire about prices .
great tomato to cheese to basil ratio .
we started with adult beverages and the onion soup .
"amazingly flavorful , and healthy !"
to call this place delicious would be an understatement .
loved the way the actors interacted with the audience .
the dough texture was flavorless and not too sweet .
my husband had the sage fried chicken and waffles .
this is the best !
it was a huge order .
absolutely my favorite asian market in c-u .
check-out speedy checkout via the flat screen tv .
good ambience and service .

the dj though ... my god .
the tuna salad was bland .
"well , that never happened ."
i did n't want to leave the room .
db had some wine and it was pronounced delicious .
food was ` ` ehh .
and comes with a side of shrimp fried rice .

their pizza cookies are to die for !
oh ... the food ?
they have really nice salad too !
. here in az . .
mary lynn <UNK> rn <UNK>
lacked sophistication and the food felt overly <UNK> .
we ended the meal with warm mini <UNK> .
the service is equally as wonderful as the menu .
the drinks are delicious .
<UNK> salad : special in spring 0000 .
the menu items were pretty pricey as well .
arizona mills blows that one away !

"like i said , the food never disappoints ."
other customer asked if she could call for backup .
thinking about the food makes my mouth salivate .
"bacon , bacon and more bacon !"
it was affordable and convenient !
there should be <UNK> against stupid pricing like this .
the whole wheat bun was soft .
i fell in love from first bite !
<UNK> will return to you .
it was just awful .
i had a salad and it was delicious .
can we get any cheaper ?
my mom ate every bite with a smile .
why would he be so rude ?
servers were friendly and fast .
"my noodles , oh man , super good ."
how much can you explain a pixie cut .
we will go again .
& this won my heart over !
honestly we wouldnt go back .
"first , the walls were super thin ."
there were some new faces working there last time .
even have live bands playing too .
<UNK> studio is definitely the <UNK> .
i highly recommend this place .
i loved the rooms .
i ca n't imagine the view getting any better .
the only downfall was the dumplings .
"very , very good customer service here ."
absolutely delicious with the friendliest service ever .
great place to share food with friends .

the tasting was a nice little touch .
"second , service seemed slightly amateur ."
one caveat : be prepared to pay .
the fish was very fresh .
i can never come close to finishing my plate .

* what is up with this place ?
they gladly gave us a glass of ice .
the food is delicious .
plus their service is awful .
absolutely love this place .
"come on , kids live for that stuff !"
"really great , full menu ."
i would n't come here .
the portions were right and it always tastes great .

the staff seems stressed and unhappy .
this place is awesome !
this place is great !
i ' ve been to this location twice .
love the table side guacamole and their bean dip !
i tried their filet and it was absolutely perfect .
i got the tuna melt .
why was it taking so long ?
the raw oysters were also surprisingly fresh & delectable .
we were both very happy with our decisions .
always fresh and customer service are excellent .
"not too saucy , perfect amount of raw ."
just do n't expect too much !
the star of the show was our fried catfish .
loved the variety of froyo and toppings !
i got my donut fix !
it definitely could more sweet soy sauce .
my fav hotel in vegas .
"not the best customer service , eh ?"
i definitely recommend if you are in the neighborhood !
. unsafe and took too long !
served with cream cheese syrup .
complete with metal plates and pizza trays .
it ' s the little things .
but the meal overall was pretty satisfying .
our house looks great !
"the food was delicious , fast , and plentiful ."
i like that latin nights the best .
it was really disappointing though .
will stay here again .
not a huge deal though !
it was beyond awkward .
i can not wait to come back .
sourdough bread to start .
that ' s saying something !
i loved this place .
"finally , the bloody mary arrives !"
- lrb - what a concept !
no frat boys or beer pong here .
ambience is lovely - simple but contemporary interior .
no such tables were ready .
"spacious , comfortable with outdoor seating and delicious coffee ."
dr <UNK> was not at all understanding or caring .
it ' s near the discount movie theater .
even then still had some kick .
not too much different that other acts .
we had a great experience .
we had a great experience .
dessert - the saving grace .
seemed like she knew us for years .
not good at all .
the service was fast and friendly .
they ' re so pop and cheesy .
there was n't going to be a problem .
i really enjoyed this one a lot .
awesome atmosphere with great food and desserts !
everything is amazing and of good portion .
the biggest letdown was the chicken congee .
over all a serious a + in my book .
the staff were not the friendliest .
so excited for their cafe to open !
i think you ' d like it .
drinks start at $ 00 .
i would go here again .
not for salad and burgers .
i got the gnocchi <UNK> and added chicken .
the peking duck was very greasy .
this was a huge disappointment because i love cheese .
i called it in and amanda took our order .
recently i got a new puppy .
made us go check our bags 0 .
we will definitely return .
she left me feeling good and with a smile .
i love you sashimi .
for dessert we shared the coconut cream pie .
we were immediately greeted and welcomed .
my rating is mainly based on the food taste .
thank you staff at tacos and more !
servers and bus boys eating at the counter .
<UNK> are very knowledgeable .
i also got a baklava that was delicious .
excellent service ... very fresh .
really bland and i was let down .
so i went to the hostess and got seated .
it was a great deal for $ 00 !
"plus , xs is a great club !"
excellent and attentive service by hostesses and servers .
the drinks are absolutely amazing .
- mikey is funny .
i ca n't wait to go back !
they even helped with getting my financing straight
"it ' s worth it , trust me ."
now the actually walk up is pretty difficult .
the garlic / cheese bread is also incredibly dry .

the orange sauce has a tang to it .
we were there a hour early .
especially for wynn brides - it is very convenient .
windsor is one of our local favorites .
super overpriced as well .
my daughter munched most of mine .
. but more honey than lemon than i wished .
stopped in for lunch on a monday around 0:00 .
i would have been fine with the regular fries .
everything we ordered was heavenly !
in the whole store .
the latte was also quite nice .
skip it and go somewhere else .
i would not recommend this place nor return .
and our server was awsome !
ambience is great as well .
quite an educational lunch for him !
"the service , however , was terrible ."
an hour - lrb - maybe 00mins ?
"well , they ca n't all be winners ."

this place was amazing !
and i had to ask for hoisin sauce .
we will be back again !
menu and food : the menu is pretty big .
thank you so much to chris and his team !
the fun drinks were totally <UNK> it !
this dinner was wonderful .
- rrb - to take home .
the sausage tasted like nothing .
the coffee here is lovely .
g and i were the last to show up .
. do n't forget the massive cannoli too .
love the raw milk .
it should be at least as good as crudo .
we waited for about 00 mins .
there was the perfect amount of sauce .
chocolate fondant with burnt marshmallow ice cream was delish .
and the waitress does n't know ?
definitely not for sharing .
"it ' s a small , cozy restaurant ."
it was absolutely delightful and large !
unfortunate that one egg can ruin the whole bunch .
i * love * men with manners .
everything we ordered was delicious .
what i do n't like ?
hoping it was just this time .
"she was very attentive , though ."
"first thing is , the place is beautiful ."
they gave me the run around for 0 weeks .
its inside a giant chandelier ... sparkly and new .
"if i could give negative stars , i would ."
"i liked the sliced hot links , yum !"
ham and pineapple is one of our favs .
and i almost forgot to mention the <UNK> .
i did not enjoy my experience .
' they are remodeling g .
its kitschy / tacky / fun decor is mesmerizing .
they have awesome happy hour food at cheap prices .
not the average sushi joint ... not average anything !
they serve yummy bruschetta to start .
i received confirmation numbers .
the service is great and everyone is so nice .
that night the place was packed !
we arrived starving and this was just awful .
food was mediocre at best .
there is parking in the back .
it ' s pretty average .
the food at <UNK> is consistently flavorful and delicious .
the atmosphere is real laid back ... small establishment .
use these guys - you wo n't be sorry !
the food was sloppy and the service was awful .
is it worth waiting forever no !
the people that work here are really friendly .
but the valet attendants were very pleasant and helpful .
you must be vip .
worst pizza i have ever ordered and had delivered .
the service was friendly and attentive .
the 0 is because im a yogurt snob .
the edamame were fine .
the pink cadillac cupcake is to die for .
the staff is always nice and friendly .
my husband ' s order was definitely spicy .
the chocolate was creamy but not overly sweet .
he was right in range for both .
went back to exchange ... same thing !
my husband and i are carnivores through and through .
"our favourite cafe , anywhere !"
we got there around 0:00 pm .
everything was 0 stars !
i love this place .
it tasted like summertime .
i practically licked my plate !
i love the cherry turnover .
certainly not the brightest people at the airport .
we will not be going back .
the interior decor was beautiful .
the beans were n't very warm and tasted bland .
can you believe this travesty !
not many sushi places in that area .
i could wander around in there for hours .
"no way , no how ."
i will definitely be coming next time .
tried the euro burger and it was also fantastic !
i dine in almost every restaurant in this area .
my son did not like anything at all .
they did offer us ear plugs .
the hotel pool is small and old .
this store is fantastic .
"the place was open , airy , and fun !"
busy usually means good .
sound levels were fine .
they have the best home made blue cheese dressing .
he was pretty nice .
i actually felt badly once she said that .
and just knowing that concept made me excited !
"<UNK> , baked potato - yummy , sugary <UNK> ."
please go somewhere else for pizza .
even my margarita was terrible .
we did enjoy the pool and spa .
i was really happy with our room .
my biggest disappointment was the soda drinks .
they are really fast and great quality .
i ' m with a another reviewer .
this made me very uncomfortable .
i called them for a 0nd opinion .
definitely not worth the 00.00 plus tax and tip .
then she forgets to inform us of the specials .
i purchase 0 different flavored cupcakes .
fresh lemon with a little kick from the cayenne .
best vegan pizza in town !
they ' ve got it !
best cupcakes on the strip .
it ' ll be worth it .
the food was fabulous .
i could do with a 0oz size .
the ribs with red curry were really yummy .
this family owned restaurant always satisfies my sushi cravings .
"regarding my drink , i tried a caramel macchiato ."
favorite bagel place for sure best donut place ever !
ca n't wait to go back .
i like it here .
i found <UNK> on groupon .
they will get all of my future automotive business !
we dug in and the burgers were pretty good !
black tea was delicious .
"i was apprehensive , but went inside ."
i would go again .
now on to the room .
my daughter worked her charm and got 0 lol .
the waitress was very sweet and attentive .
"edible , but not impressed ."
i thought the pho portion size was just right .
instead we got about 0 pounds of <UNK> dough .
we will use them again .
the rolls themselves were on the spicy side .
i come back when there ' s a line .
it was not crowded at all .
the atmosphere is also very modern yet quaint .
so i guess they are doing something right !
the croissant is surprising soft .
i felt like criminal running form the police !
left happy and stuffed for the spa .
"concierge is friendly , funny and honest ."
it is delicious and fresh .
lots of areas to sit and chill out .
horrible company to rent from .
"would i order it again , absolutely !"
dog poop is everywhere !
but it was horrible .
and it did n't seem very fresh either .
the beds are so comfy !
"hmm , getting better ."
menu says chunky tomato compote .
good luck to all who come to horizon
seems overly sweet and leaves a funky after taste .
always a treat going here !
i ' ll definitely be back !
it ' s a hit and miss .
our go-to place when we are in the area .
i called her over and she confirmed .
the burger was cooked to perfection .
probably from the aforementioned icky spinach .
love it and love the atmosphere !
i called and placed my order at 0:00 .
green chili stew is amazing !
they have gorgeous clothes .
so for them it is a smart marketing technique .
"atmosphere was down to earth , professional and efficient ."
it pays to follow-up !
the atmosphere is inviting .
my children are 0 and 0 .
<UNK> stands for love your food every day .
<UNK> yep you get what you pay for !
service was however slow .
food was poor i order biscuits and gravy .
"run , do n't walk to <UNK> ."
but do n't worry .
all the meat is great !
the staff is like family and very friendly .
drinks were great too .
it is really about the <UNK> i guess .
"tivoli square is beautiful , but ultimately boring ."
i loved there food and service .
"great atmosphere , blues band played the whole time ."
i ordered the <UNK> mojito .
dish was a large portion and very flavorful .
a fusion of my dream street tacos !
near the amc theater .
the staff were very nice and informative .
i even loved the glass ware !
would definitely go back here .
the ladies where very helpful and knowledgable .
they call you for your appointment for ct scan .
the nails fell off so quick it was ridiculous .
their monte cristo is wonderful .
+ 0 star - server .
i ca n't wait to try their salads .
"the baguette was fresh , which was nice ."
another side option is tots .
ceviche spoons were fresh and light .
tell me that ' s not a classic .
it ' s really comfort food at its best .
their service is a lot better than i assumed .
this food was horrible .
where is the pasta and antipasta ?
easily one of my new favorite places .
waiter was definitely not on his a game today .
i knew my complaints would be irrelevant .
i love this place .
wow ... every station has amazed me .
this place is a must over mojo .
i have thrown multiple <UNK> here .
satay chicken - fresh with tasty peanut sauce .
we all really enjoyed our food and service .
his photographs are all mostly panoramic landscape images .
my boyfriend had the lasagna .
they sacrificed parking for patio seating .
there was half off bottles of wine .
"sushi , coffee , wine , cheese ?"
i ' m glad i did !
"plenty of tables , though , in the courtyard ."
she could have been polite .
at first it did n't start .
amenities included : 0 .
we bought $ 000 gift <UNK> .
my favorite is the pico .
"my fish was okay , at least not soggy ."
they were not edible .
maybe give piccolo another whirl ... .
we will definitely go back again and again !
all in the first appointment !
someone else used a groupon and had an issue .
now who would n't want that ?
had a <UNK> here !
still had the beer pong and everything .
the aria was so comfortable and accommodating .
breakfast was bland and not much to choose from .
i will not be going there again .
she offered no guidance or help .
restaurants were n't anything to speak of .
happy hour m-f 0-0 i think .
every time someone - lrb - manager ?
i hate them and think they ' re gross .
- lrb - chicken bone broth !
it was simply delicious .
when will a new shipment come in ?
the food was n't too bad .
my favorite was our server rob .
it ' s fairly roomy .
my mouth started drooling thinking about it .
"they are open for breakfast , brunch and lunch ."
and do n't forget your camera !
we were out of the room until approx .
what i did n't like was the slaw .
overall a very nice experience .
its like vegas at its best !
this place is amazing .
the owners are always there & so polite !
<UNK> <UNK> teacher & grad gifts .
it came with a small tasty salad .
"however , for our stay the price was right ."
she even helped us <UNK> the crawfish .

overall i think this is a good location .
and we were on time !
customer service and food is excellent !

i do n't know what has happened .

pretty good for a friday night !
the restaurant is clean and our server was good .

we booked through expedia for our honeymoon .
* really * delicious !
nothing great this time around .
what we got was crappy seasoned tilapia .

our nachos have always came out pretty good .
let ' s move on to dessert shall we ?
hope your pets are happy and shiny !
' ' service here is awful .
the fact that it ' s healthy ?
what ' s not fun about painting and drinking ?
the portions are generous .
i can just imagine how <UNK> must feel .
the staff is friendly .
it is in a little plaza in chinatown .
this unassuming food stand really packs a punch .
i love sitting at the bar .
the guy that answered was super nice .
"service was fast , tattooed , and friendly ."
this was my first time here .
who am i kidding ?
i did n't have any problem .
our server / bartender was great ... and cute .
the fish tacos were on point .
"first of all , the indoor area is tiny ."
it was all dessert or nothing .
"we are understanding people , so we waited ."
a must try : - rrb - btw .
our only complaint was that we only received two .
he acted like we were a bother to him .
it is not privacy glass .
this place made my night simply spectacular !
food is really good and made my tummy happy
i have absolutely no complaints .
the cashier samantha was adorable and very nice .
like a new top or a cute dress .
<UNK> excellent customer service that night was on point !
our first time staying here with my family .

i guess they do n't like making money .
: - rrb - great car buying experience !
we ' ll definitely be back !
. 0 girls with big stomachs - no problem .
great wine specials and beer tastings on wednesday .
everything was so bland .
good for cheesecake lovers !
then we were off !

only vegetable croquettes was notable .

"now thats customer service , acknowledgement <UNK> arrival !"
highly recommend checking them out !
my hubby got sick off this food .
they do this for free and are amazing !
i love this news station .
first and last time .
it ' s easy to get pretty at <UNK> .
it was to die for !
and the chocolate chai .
cute little spot in plaza midwood .
i would recommend this restaurant .
"they have awesome french toast , delicious !"
the carne asada was bomb !
not one of our meals was over $ 00 !
let ' s be clear .
i love the way it looks inside .
and she kept calling me <UNK> .
i ca n't wait to go back again .

i love the atmosphere .
i have never been so embarrassed in public .
fry ' s low sale <UNK> i dreaming ?
i ai n't gon na lie .

enough to not go back again .
her portion was twice the size of his .
this is odd because you ca n't return things .
"cool , <UNK> music ."
... cheddar scallion biscuits - best thing we ordered .
"also , they only take cash ."
portions were huge and prices very affordable .
wandered down for breakfast at 00:00 .

i actually got sick from it the last time .
it was a michael jackson fan ' s dream .
it was so dark out .
i ordered a steak salad and it was decent .

wish u were n't so far away .
i ca n't wait to take more classes .
had the bbq burger nom nom nom !
i went here with a friend for restaurant week .
every time i go there i find something cool !
quality of clothing is about the same as goodwill .
i do n't remember what i ordered .
customer service was not bad .
always come here whenever we visit vegas .
nevertheless all damages were acknowledged on my photos .
maybe this place is just all about dessert .
will be sad when we move away .
i wish they had half stars .
it is so gross .
wonderful place to stay .
our waitress was lovely and quick to serve us .
"again , tiny portions ."
because of the cute green dinosaur on the sign .
do n't waste your money at serendipity .
i know you wo n't be disappointed .
whoever came up with this concept is just brilliant .
i recommend it and would definitely go back !
we were seated right away in a little booth .
the chicken skins were so good .
he was always on top of it .
never going there again .
how embarrassing for you .
at what i think really good price .
this is really good .
we also ordered samosas and they were delicious .
i ' ll definitely be going back .
the staff was extremely helpful and pleasant .
"our server , ian was extremely patient and attentive ."
i found him to be knowledgeable and empathetic .
we were very pleasantly surprised by the place .
i ca n't wait to go back !
that ruined my whole experience .
do i have an addiction ?
i had the steak sandwich with onion strings .
i love pita jungle .
that was the first time that we were there .
"i adore the rooms , decor , and staff ."
i really think they could do better .
i ' d recommend a visit .
it ' s not the long lines .
my only real complaint was the very thin walls !
best i have ever had .
"anyway , let ' s talk food ."
this place makes me happy .
this business is terrible .
- the southern has wifi !
weekdays will provide a more calming shopping experience .
kid ran up it twice .
i thought it was a little sweet & tangy .
i prepaid a <UNK> through travelocity for $ 00 .
the baked brie was out of this word .
not sure what all the hype is all about .
and it also helps that their food is amazing !
on the plus side it was really good food .
not that much fat .
<UNK> <UNK> stimulating people .
"so , try not to fill up ."
weird that they never eat that much at home .
the atmosphere was trendy .
on to the desserts .
we went to have something on the regular menu .
i tried their lemongrass and it was refreshing !
tried the polenta fries .
so f you gilbert house .
made with pride and tlc !
good luck in your new location .
seaweed salad : was yummy .
"okay , let ' s get down to business ."
' ' my absolute favorite thai place in vegas !
beware the portions are huge !
i had a fabulous time at noodlehead .
i loved this theatre .
yum ... i ' d eat that every day !
"the tea was strong , cold and delicious ."
the 0 star ratings on yelp were well deserved .
i would eat here again .
i just visited recently during lunch time at noon .
affordable and great food !
i have eaten there at least 00 times !
the birds all seem happy and healthy .
the quality of their food have gone down .
just like mom use to make .
seriously shocked and would probably return just for that .
one of my favorite places in downtown phoenix .
and she did a great job !
oh and did i mention overpriced ?
patio seating was lovely ... food was uninspiring ... .
"heck no , the <UNK> kept coming !"
"this place like so many doctors , <UNK> ... ."
they have boxes for 0 & 00 truffle assortments .
this brought us to the daily dose .
and how else can a vegetarian try haggis ?
i called and left the company 0 voicemails .
was my skirt riding up ?
i would totally go back there again !
pretty much just perfect .
our scallops were undercooked .
it alcohol will creep up on you .
they have sandwiches and light fare .
thumbs up to ghost bar security !
just make it one or the other ... .
but i was afraid .
i have had good and bad experiences here .
love the diversity and i will be back !
i also thought the prices were very reasonable .
it was disgusting that they were even using those .
two stars because the s'mores hot chocolate was wonderful !
i also ordered a tamale as a side .
i would n't order the cake again .
"wings were great , but garlic knots were so-so ."
please say it is n't so joe ' s !
"since my mind was more open , i figure ?"
their service is amazing .
nutritional information is displayed for most items .
i love this place .
how can you not enjoy it .
do n't get me wrong .
"delicious meats , and more !"
i just love guilty lily ' s .
delicious 00 hour joint !
the service was impeccable .
the down side is the service .
the difference was the flavor !
will admit the service was efficient .
they named it abuelos for a reason !
a doctor is as good as his office staff .
"the vibe is hipster , but not condescending ."
they seem to have many additional services to offer .
i came for lunch with a friend .
that is so sweet .
you can pass on the bananas foster <UNK> © .
even offered someone in our party a vegan menu .
we ordered meatballs with angel hair and lasagna .
the boyfriend eats the rest of the variety lol .
"all in all , i ' m pretty impressed !"
"anyhow , back to the hookah ."
"honestly , this is just bad business ."
an interesting and tasty cocktail menu .
so much variety and so many options .
i love free stuff so i take full advantage !
i would love to work with her again !
i love record stores .
i love the spinach curry with tofu katsu .
it ' s an escape away from las vegas .
<UNK> of our pizza was burned on the crust .
my boyfriend ordered the prime rib benny .
"nonetheless , we ended up taking our pizza to-go ."
ca n't wait to go back .
boyfriend ordered the catfish po-boy .
you can never beat that .
it was really good and really packed at 0am .
they just had some plain looking <UNK> .
the buffet was just okay .
this is definitely our favorite sub shop in pittsburgh !
i would love to come back here again .
the dessert was unfortunately disappointing and very plain .
my vet totally disagreed !
. but i too feel the same way .
can also be extremely spicy !
they still charged me for it .
they have bagged salads that are organic .
"organized , quick , helpful ."
the wait and service were <UNK> !
"well , so will the hummus ."
the food is exceptional !
we would definitely go back for dinner .
pool is really small and probably swimming with <UNK> .
the breaded shrimp tasted weird too .
good food and attentive service .
. i would never stay here again !
clean <UNK> did a better job than everyone !
literally did not even try and look it up !
even my kid ' s food was good .
"next time , i would order it sans sauce ."
it tasted store bought .
"but , i think i ' m done ."
i was very impressed .
my decision was n't easy .
"high price , small plates , weird food ."
but fear not buffet mashed potato lovers !
i fell asleep during almost all the songs !
grandson enjoyed their french fries too .
decent sized menu for such a small location .
"seriously , they do n't deserve any stars !"
thank goodness for that !
the mr . t was not tart at all .
i say boo <UNK> to chompies and einstein bagels .
lastly we got desserts and they were great too !
i was so hungry .
it was sooooo cheesey and delicious .
this is definitely a great place for eye candy !
and i do n't really like lobster !
generous portion of meat .
and not just any candy either .
their salads are good portions and are pretty tasty .
my philly cheese steak was also tasty !
i will definitely be back !
i love quirky characteristics like that .
great atmosphere and even better food .
it really is n't much .
try the beer sampler very fun and educational .
"the soup was definitely good , but not great ."
"<UNK> , triple price , non refundable ."
no one took more than two bites .
you should check her out !
' ' it is nice and sweet .
also got great service .
the place is clean .
the crepe was soggy .
what a scrumptious little bite .
i ' ll come back whenever i have more money
i am very impressed !
you can drive through or walk up .
that potato is reason enough to go back !
. the only negative things ... .
all the food even the pizza looked amazing .
that is a great deal .
i ordered carnitas and it was pretty terrible .
. so for guys who like butts .
i highly recommend this .
"tea was alright , too much ice ."
i personally would recommend this place .
and their mango drink ... .
so i decided to tag along .
the staff was great and the food was delicious .
they were n't spicy either !
we orders the bruschetta of course .
i just like it by itself .
only in las vegas !
it was a great experience .
the souffles are to die for as well .
so happy for more options in market square !
will definitely come back here .
why only 0 stars ?
there were 0 of us .
but great place though !
never tasted a soup like this before .
the mimosas were great too .
i got the plate with the falafel .
we also shared 0 glasses of wine .
sigh ... - macarons : yuck .
all flavors are made fresh with real ingredients .
"these days , that ' s a bargain !"
i think they are catering to <UNK> .
i mean ... really people .
"rather , it has a firm cornmeal texture ."
"but honestly , it ' s not surprising ."
"i forget which one but , it was delicious ."
had the salted caramel macaron .
you ' re basically in a shopping center .
i am a bun bo hue addict !
you can not say one bad thing !
it was okay ; <UNK> too sweet .
maybe i should have had the fish !
let me mention our guide <UNK> .
amazing seafood in gilbert .
took away one star because of the moscow mule .
after moving rooms connecting door does n't open .
i had the slider appetizer which was great .
i had such a great time !
do n't worry lindo .
more so than other <UNK> in my opinion .
i have no complaints .
we quickly found out why .
the receptionist was very snippy .
i had the much raved about hawaiian french toast .
steak teriyaki portion was pretty generous .
so pink and so vintage .
"the rooms were small , but comfortable and clean ."
i was happy with our whole experience .
it was n't just us .
<UNK> said tickets go on sale september 0 .
"however , it failed in terms of taste ."
my family loves this shop !
service is usually great but today it was okay .
egg rolls a little dry for my taste .
we dropped in for a very late dinner .
join the pure privilege club .
do n't go through the drive thru !
all ingredients were fresh and chopped nicely .
so we ' ve been a couple times .
0 people and the bill is under $ 00.00 .
ate all of it .
euro burger was definitely the favorite !
went in for breakfast .
he deserves a raise .
i love bahn mi .
i just wanted some kind of flavor .
great service at a great price !
i love their fish tacos !
i ' ll eat my veggies thank you .
the drinks are pretty good .
"the fries were decent steak fries , but def ."
got seated at the bar .
you are allowed to wear a swim suit .
"i ' ve tried passion fruit , and strawberry ."
i love their pizzas .
otherwise be prepared to stand in line .
i wo n't be back .
i also like their cookie butter cookies .
we had quinn who was very friendly and helpful .
a little expensive but it ' s worth it !
their cappuccinos are velvety smooth and so refined .
you will love it !
too bad i do love the food .
but it ' s nothing to write home about .
absolutely best chicken ... ever .
ya got ta drag them along !
they were n't what i was expecting .
it ' s so cool .
- lrb - of course they have misters .
if she was busy she could have said that .
"perfectly crunchy , salty , sweet , spicy ."
like i said - - huh ?
i had a chicken dish with salad .
and he ' s super cute !
"beautiful grounds , well kept ."
i loved this place .
likely wo n't go back .
the piano player is wonderful .
i am so disappointed .
full of rich chocolate flavor without being sugary sweet .
the jams and jellies are pastries here are delicious .
i highly recommend her for your services !
i highly recommend them !
i could write an ode to that dessert .
thanks again for making my life so much easier !
we just went here for lunch .
"the bath amenities are impressive , though ."
i told him it was n't worth it .
i noticed that the service was incredibly slow .
"rather than turn back , i just kept going ."
had to leave a message .
the second time was just with my so .
delicious flights of wine .
first time here mostly because i live in tucson .
the decor is horrible .
the staff was helpful and friendly too .
heard there is one at guadalupe and alma school .
surprisingly they were really quiet .
love the large variety of toppings .
no doubt about it .
as for the decor - meh .
i had the chicken and biscuits .
"also , the free wifi is a huge plus ."
we love every one of them .
or so i thought .
they are only open during the weekdays .
wish they had that posted on the menu outside .
the food was absolutely amazing .
i got the 00 oz .
great afternoon prices too .
i wonder if they even use a rub ?
which is an a + + in my book !
sooo fresh tasting but not at all heavy .
' ' i was appalled .
kid-friendly if the budget allows a splurge .
the food is delicious .
i rather eat subway .
the staff was also very kind and helpful .
i would be happier eating a frozen dinner .
he is very funny and friendly !
xx it did n't come with fries .
all the great reviews have me scratching my head .
he was so nice and generous !
i love this place .
two very <UNK> waitresses were <UNK> dressed and <UNK> .
was really relaxing and calm .
ice cream $ 0.00 - we got green tea .
i love the curbside food pick-up option .
and i definitely do n't leave impressed .
their vending machines are nothing short of amazing !
soup base extreme salty !
so i just use my <UNK> at home .
the staff is amazing and always so helpful .
they were on time with the dogs .
it comes with a slightly spicy tomato dip .
their service is attentive and the food !
he even took pictures with us after our ride !
such a fun place ... you should stop by !
i picked a cocktail - off .
"we had mexican food , of course !"
this kind of pissed me off .
i really love this concept .
the food was great !
love it i love it !
crispy and hot like they should be !
i decided to get some brown juicy <UNK> sunglasses .
we will definitely go back !
i have a thing about scallops .
the moto <UNK> was absolutely my favorite !
had the vegetarian chilli which was filling and delicious !
it is such a pleasure !
this store really is amazing .
plenty of free parking available as well !
their recipes are just right .
five stars for customer service from scott !
my dog <UNK> them .
i also tried the tuna sandwich .
starting my bb summer habits early this year .
"inside was amazing , upstairs and downstairs ."
even the pita bread was perfectly done .
it ' s a good park .
<UNK> ' s was awesome !
i do n't want yoga .
"hubby , curry duck ."
small but they take reservations .
the pizza was missing some toppings too .
"she is always dressed very <UNK> , as well !"
pets are n't allowed for health reasons .
yep the tomato soup rocked !
the best nacho ' s in downtown vegas .
"not great , not awful , just okay ."
i love how big the space is .
"seriously , i said i get it !"
this really hit the spot .
i would go back just for the crepe .
the pictures speak for themselves .
i m willing to pay that .
"i always get the crawfish , always always ."
there were six of us .
"i had medium poached eggs , which were perfect !"
apparently he loved his encounter with just like home .
i did n't know cirque could be this bad !
say it with me : nutritional yeast !
our hostess was phenomenal .
things did n't improve from there .
we ' ll be back !
i had to spit all of them out .
not too impressed by the steak .
but their soda did not taste good !
i do n't believe it was beef .
"in fact , they are pretty nice ."
and so was the fried chicken sandwich .
but i still liked what i got !
i love this place ! ! !
next time for sure !
it was just simply too sweet !
it was n't even busy the day we went .
it would ' ve given us space to dance .
it was kinda messy but really really good !
the wall decor by the waiting place was cute .
i ' m so disappointed .
i would definitely order here again .
they only offer bottled water for $ 0 .
i was not happy .
the customer service is what makes it .
the staff there are super nice and <UNK> .
do not go inside the snack bar .
and it ' s meatless .
definitely try this place out !
glad i live nearby !
none of the usual restaurant week limitations .
ca n't wait for dinner !
they look so real !
they also have a big patio area .
you do feel comfortable being here .
visited it for the first time tonight .
"unfortunately , that was too often for me ."
server did his job above and beyond .
vegas ... and where did i stay ?
rare b sides at that !
great for the city !
all i can say is yummy !
we will definitely be coming back .
this place has seriously gone downhill .
all in all gr0 experience .
had the shish <UNK> .
it was really unprofessional .
. what do i know .
and you know what ?
must check out is what i thought .
the place is huge and very well kept up .
"sounds nice , right ?"
i would come back .
it was n't that busy for lunch around 0ish .
which is sad because the food was decent .
does that make any sense ?
best pretzel i have ever had !
the staff was wonderful and helpful .
the photographer did not rush us .
i had the pork tenderloin .
. this place is hella pricey !
fun name as well !
this is my only complaint of the evening .
the blueberry pancakes are large .
now my new favorite wings .
also love the sesame peanut and ponzu of course .
the happy hour is awesome !
our server was sweet and helpful .
- love the cole slaw and the waffle fries !
i am all about mussels .
we ca n't wait to go back !
we stopped in to taste some liquor and whiskey .
best all you can eat sushi in vegas !
go get yourself a slice .
i must say that i was very disappointed .
yup the cinnamon roll is a winner !
the food was delicious and presented very well .
i went to find a seat .
my favorite was the pistachio .
i ' m excited for my leftovers .
we have to leave .
i probably will not stay here again .
best chicken strips i ' ve ever had !
the squid salad is delish too .
a lot of fun !
their cheese board is ginormous !
at least the laughter kept my belly full .
this was my first hotel ever in vegas .
how can healthy taste so good .
jjanga does the best sushi in town .
the atmosphere is great both inside and outside .
"i got root beer , pistachio , and amaretto ."
reminded me of forgetting sarah marshall .
they were beautiful but stale .
let me start w / the previous purchase .
some places forget about the customer <UNK> !
the drinks are good and reasonably priced .
the office staff are all very professional and friendly .
very informative and heartfelt .
the staff are very friendly .
we went on a d-backs game day !
then he abruptly hung up on me .
"why , you might ask ?"
do that thing with the meat <UNK> !
i mean really low flow !
it was dark with no sort of light ambiance .
the service was very kind and professional .
i got chorizo tacos and a chili verde tamale .
i will come back .
"it was heaven , i tell ya ."
"frankly , this makes no sense ."
service : great service !
but maybe not rush back .
the chef is fantastic !
the exhibits were really well thought out .
the truffle mac and cheese was good .
location is great too .
the traffic sucks so i try to avoid it .
that were a little small .
the location in miami is gorgeous .
it was n't worth the effort to address .
went here for my birthday .
their bar was open so we stopped in .
and the prices were comparable .
good place to grab a late night drink .
i was excited to try this cute little place .
was recommended to us by our friends .
crying and <UNK> kids equal annoyed and unhappy customers .
we will definitely be back ! !
i turned back around and ordered one for dessert .
service was very friendly and attentive .
tidbits of our night out : 0 .
the rib eye with mashed is delicious !
we always finish with ice cream for dessert .
amazing old school italian !
we will definitely be back !
we were the only customers in the entire restaurant .
friendly service and very relaxing place to chill out .
there will always be dissatisfied customers no matter what !
"faves are the unlimited vegetables , rice and tofu ."
i had the chicken and spinach slice .
we love this place !
we could use more spaces like this !
i was extremely impressed with the service .
i ' ll be back !
"was here for dinner , not the lounge ."
so great job <UNK> for being creative !
i ordered an iced cappuccino with boba .
saganaki was amazing as well .
the decor inside was beautiful .
i had a c - section at this hospital .
the total came out to $ 0.00 .
it makes sense they have a limited selection here .
the crusted goat cheese salad was very tasty .
all around great restaurant !
ended up leaving to go to another place .
i have to say it was pretty good .
and the owner is really nice and helpful .
beautiful bridge running through it .
the hotel itself is very new .
totally reminds me of the fillmore in sf .
"the inside is beautiful , warm and inviting ."
one dine-in is enough !
this is an amazing restaurant .
makes the place looks trashy .
"not a fan of dogs , but ehhh ."
good selection of wines .
slurped it all up .
0 trips were for <UNK> .
she never brought us more coffee .
i love their loose herb section .
our waiter was the best .
alma is definitely an asset to this <UNK> store .
"taste-wise , however , burgatory is way better ."
. ' ' there lies my problem .
no name sushi is a must try !
the food warehouse was as big as costco !
i would give them 0 stars for that .
my mouth is watering writing this review .
big spacious bathrooms though the toilets were way too high
the front office is very efficient and well run .
i had two ground beef tacos which were disgusting !
worst customer service ever .
the seasoned fries were great too .
these cupcakes were okay .
arizona definitely needs more of these type restaurants .
a very cheap mall .
like beef that had been sitting around too long .
little disappointed ran out of lobster and only 000 .
. so they gave it to me for free !
the food has been ok .
we asked for the check as quickly as possible .
this is our new favorite place for pizza .
we enjoyed both dishes a lot .
i should have gone to orange sky instead !
another great fuego restaurant !
not enough meat and the bread was alright .
the wait staff was amazing .
"yes , they have tacos now !"
but the artwork is local and not high priced .
worst hot pot ever .
other than that the food was okay .
service here is decent and quite friendly .
i will <UNK> come back .
"hmm , could their housekeeping department be biased ?"
it was the service that was disappointing .
the <UNK> chicken was bright orange and tough .
i get it often and i love it .
his response was their salmon takes longer to cook ?
i took a bite and i seriously almost puked .
"oh well , next time ."
"seriously , <UNK> it ."

that ' s what keeps us coming back .
what more could you ask for ?
"massive amounts of food , but so yummy ."
i flew southwest and her delta .

every special burger is mouth watering .
it was pretty fantastic .
"perfect crust , perfect sauce !"
i would n't recommend this place .
the overall experience made up for it .
the service is very slow and sporadic at best .
the biscuits they give you were good but cold .
in the bathroom plenty of towels and wash clothes .
especially when someone is asking for help .
"i mean , he was excited about it ."
just come and see for yourself !

these reviews are upsetting me !
another 00 minutes and she appeared .
nice ! ! omg ... we loved it .
i love supporting this small local business .
i ate most of it and was stuffed .
the mac and cheese was homemade and so good !
the staff is always super nice here .
menu looked to be exactly the same .
i told her i was ready to order .
! ! so this is our second time here .
it was absolutely rancid !
definitely feeling disappointed and not very important .

table was n't ready for the moment .
<UNK> we were fun <UNK> that no one did .

i could have easily eaten double !
the sweet potato fries were just okay .
food was really good .
you can watch my flight video at : <UNK>
i love the decor !
dark and dirty and falling apart feeling inside .
amazing staff and terrific cocktails .
apparently the brownies here are made from <UNK> chocolate !
the owner will get mad .
"great prices , delicious food and quick ."
place was like a sauna !
inside they have a sauna and a steam room .
it really is ` ` go raw ' ' .
i would order it again .
kimchi was too old and jun was all burned .
open for all meals .
i love eating here !
why are you even reading this ?
"for dessert , the little donuts are delicious !"
if you are craving pancakes then definitely go here .
but it was just sort of unnecessary .
bad location but awesome food !
it had just the right balance of ginger .
. took away from the show for me .
i loved the scottsdale location .
probably pricy because it ' s vegas ?
specialty sauces & crackers ?
so why 0 stars ?
would not recommend <UNK> !
so i still went with a classic grilled cheese !
our overall total was $ 00-00 .
the owner is sooo very very sweet .
forget bread and butter .
"waited , waited , waited ."
"nevertheless , this perplexed me ."
i pay a little over 000 for rent .
we both chose the nutella bomb cake .
it was so good .
i got a new <UNK> !
"ordered the bbq chicken , which was delicious ."
it was worth it my husband had foot problem .
instead we chose this place because it was closer .
i go back to the room to wait .
all were really tasty .
<UNK> you must come here !
"oh , the dilemma !"
came here for a farewell celebration for a co-worker .
targets a bit pricy is all .
the bacon was crisp and the waffles were tasty .
i was a virgin .
cute spot away from the big chain food places .

i was pleasantly surprised .
they are the nicest people ever .
it was too rich for my liking .
they have really great happy hour specials .
customer service works both ways .
. then the pepperoni cheese for the girls .
the giant buddha across from us was awesome .
staff is unfriendly and rude .
next our entrees arrived .
they have events in this area during the year .
it was obviously fresh off the grill .
tired of three options at your local store .
"so professional , responsive and friendly ."
fix that and i ' ll be a fan .
<UNK> always has the best yogurt and toppings .
"yes , it ' s part of the sale ."
but i probably wo n't be returning with mine .
came here tonight and thought it was interesting !
the best food ever !
again the look on my face was priceless .
"the meals were wonderful , and cooked to perfection ."
i really wanted to enjoy this place .
"anyways , our waiter was super funny and good-looking ."
this place is adorable .
"they were huge , and loaded with the veggies ."
the ambiance is nicer and so are the servers .
the omni is a hotel in an historic building .
the wait can be pretty long ... .
it ' s my go to when in vegas !
"mediocre food , average customer service , mediocre prices ."
check in was a breeze .
it was 00:00 on a saturday .
does n't open for another hour .
our server was missing ... a lot .
the live music is way too loud .
make sure to save room for dessert .
i asked for her name and drove off .
totally happy that they are right down the street .
i love fish sauce .
"it was spinach with tomato , cranberries and feta ."
"not cheap , i know ."
the burro was extremely disappointing .
it was a slightly crunchy soft shell crab .
so yummy and fast .
the avocado looked really fresh .
sounded go everyone - until we saw the line .
i recommend getting three packs for 0 week groceries .
i realized it after i opened it .
i was not expecting that at all .
"<UNK> , i am salivating just thinking about it ."
the place is very cute and has great potential .
it was that good !
"quaint little breakfast joint , relaxing and delish !"
then came the highlight ... .
by far our favorite taco was the pork belly .
the portions were huge at a great price .
"overall , good service ."
amazing customer service and promptness !
so we decided to get the sonora .
the italian sub is one of my favorites !
items that you do not need to cook .
i highly recommend this place !
i loved their margarita purchased at the bar !
we were not rushed and felt so welcome .
they were very pleased .
"efficient , friendly service ."
i do n't even know where to begin .

i was n't sure .
are you kidding me ?
and for that i am happy .
it looked so good !
our server was amazing .
they have <UNK> as well !
it gets pretty busy on weekend mornings .
neither were available when they made my appointment .
that ' s all i can say .
also provide knives please !
fresh fish & tasty salads .
but we do n't have any in hawaii !
0 in & out : light sauce add onions !
it definitely went through a great makeover .
i am so glad we did .
"great service , good food !"
anna was friendly but difficult to understand .
it ' s been bad for years .
this friday night we received exceptional service !
"fresh ingredients , atmosphere , friendly service !"
i love this alternative to ice cream and froyo .
it came with some pretty bland country potatoes .
the worst was the coleslaw .
everyone seemed very happy .
i decided on white coffee bean and salted caramel .
i will be back for more .
do n't know what the hype is .
she asked ` ` did you tell a anyone ?
must sit on the patio !
i dined here last night on a date .
dr . <UNK> and staff are extremely nice !
they also have a bar which is great .
there were maybe 0-0 other tables seated .
the other con was that there was no bathtub .
my husband and i got married in february .
the sushi was fresh and perfectly made .
"the glasses were filled , but not always quickly ."
i ' m drooling just remembering it .
we also got the chicken alfredo pasta .
ordered the gyro and hummus and pita bread .
our friends are saying the same thing .
the rooms were just really comfortable and pretty spacious .
the food is only mediocre .

"thai house , what an amazing place !"
i love their food .
our waiter was very nice and did his best .
not too sweet and yummy !
perfect for a date .

a little pricey but worth stopping at .
it kinda looks like that .
but the sleep was all worth !
then best part was the truffle mac and cheese .
their shabu is pretty good .
husband and i chose the street tacos .
we ordered the fish fry ; delicious .
and their selection of frames were really fashionable .
she did my hair exactly how i wanted .
it smells awful and hope they fix it soon .
my family loves this sprouts location .
the decoration inside is amazing .
. too much stress for being 0 months pregnant .
and so was the ultimate shrimp tempura roll .
lots of options for vegetarians .
easy to navigate than many other airports out there !
service is quick and friendly .
there was a long line .
my husband and i will be back .
the staff is wonderful .

i could n't be happier with my experience .

she took my payment and thanked me .
"that all changed this past saturday night , though ."
i went for the carrot cake .

tim & rob were both super sweet and friendly .
it tasted equally good .
the buy most of their produce from local farmers .
we finished the night with the choco 00 .

the price is n't bad either .
get rid of the electrical outlets .
* caution * the mustard is spicy .
unlimited beer and wine ?
"trust me , you wo n't regret it !"
we ended up getting the handicapped seats .
the service was fine .
"however , <UNK> grill is n't upscale ."
a little on the tacky side .
. what a disappointment .
"my hair looks so cute , i love it !"

we were then told we would be seen shortly .
the bar tender was so friendly and helpful !
so that was a plus .
everything was sooooo good !
we will defintely be back again ... hopefully soon !
the restaurant itself is beautiful and very classy .
this was a fantastic dining experience .
this place is fabulous !
no choice living with smell of sewer at home .
i threw my boyfriends surprise 00st bday party here .
service was 00 stars !
we at gameworks like false advertisement .
i ordered the calamari and it was good .
not a fan at all .
the drinks are good .
"so really , not bad ."
i actually prefer getting their savory sandwiches .
it came with warm pita .
i am warning all of you .
it ' s always fresh and delicious .
but the taste was not there !
the food was good .
the second one was by far the best .
we will be going back soon .
this is comfort food .
it was crispy and tender on the inside .
there are two men that are always there .
. we liked that .
i love this place so much !
a long list of beer and wine choices .
<UNK> is very professional and an honest <UNK> .
totally recommend fast fix .
businesses do not succeed with this type of behavior .
decor is very nice .
it is always a hassle .
"my lord , it was painful !"
best spa experience in vegas ever .
oysters - superbly fresh .
i love to watch the kitchen .
the first time came here .
we had to pay for the empty seats .
the waitresses were very nice and prompt .
but i had just walked in .
this location is always my # 0 go to .
you can add different types of toppings to it .
they got be <UNK> and <UNK> with the entertainers .
one of my old-school stand out favorites .
"it was pretty disappointing , actually ."
i recommend him to everyone !
love their healthy options !
by far the best thing on the menu .
there is always someone nearby to help .
the pancakes were the perfect amount of fluffy .
you ca n't go wrong !
super annoying this place is great !
the soups are flavorful and always fresh .
i had lunch here today .
not to mention the best chai tea and service .
wonderful food and service .
the table is big enough for both our stuff .
that stuff leaves a funky taste in my mouth .
everyone just has to be patient .
and the appetizer never came .
i love this place .
really cute and quaint deli !
0 - rrb - the tv channels sucked .
this is my favorite breakfast place .
"not too sweet , but crunchy ."
"update : okay , okay i get it ."
"hubby had the pork chop , he loved it !"
the asian nachos were delicious and surprising !
this place is fantastic !
was it worth the money ?
my kids have an enjoyable time .
they also have a good draught selection .
boy was i wrong .
plus i was able to get <UNK> maid service .
i thought that was very sweet .
this place has the absolute worst service ever .
it ' s busy every time i pass by .
my experience at seablue was good overall !
what a great spot !
every little topping costs extra ; want mushrooms ?
well ... alright then .
we have been to this buffet twice this year .
but so happy we decided to go and stay .
i would give zero stars if i could .
would love to try brunch .
i could ' ve used some <UNK> !
definitely will not be returning .
great place for lunch !
he does n't listen to your requests .
see you at the movies : - rrb -
great temperature and tasted fresh .
the casino itself is clean and appealing .
all in all it was a fun time .
"hello <UNK> , <UNK> !"
and hard to eat .
good luck with your future kiddo .
will i go back ?
we ' ll be back soon .
they had a nice little snack bar .
the party was an <UNK> of their <UNK> deck .
now that ' s good red velvet .
the signs were so unclear !
customer service is average as expected .
i ' ve come full circle .
we were extremely disappointed .
definitely the best date place in town !
i ' m absolutely <UNK> .
<UNK> cut my son ' s hair perfectly !
those two things together were awesome !
the chef was engaging and creative .
i am sorry for them .
minestrone soup was good .
the office and exams rooms are always very clean .
only the ones on the sign outside .
you can sit inside or outside .
there slow and not very friendly .
the play area is fun for the kids too .
"it ' s bright , clean and airy ."
i seriously have a problem .
"ahhh , good old qt ."
we were so not pleased with this experience .
had the california club - delish !
the bathroom was very large .
"super bright and fresh , and very plentiful ."
will never go back !
the lady was so nice .
"everything was fresh , hot and flavorful ."
get the heck over it .
i am never going back here again !
- rrb - and entry was easy <UNK> .
"clean store , good prices ... win !"
i ca n't emphasize that enough .
the chicken was amazing .
the server was very knowledgeable and helpful .
i really enjoy this place !
the beds are clean and reasonably comfortable .
it is worth it .
stop by ... do n't waste your money .
they were over the top and seemed fake .
that diner / down on the farm decor .
we had a military discount too .
"friendly staff , best customer service ."
it was basically a deep fried potsticker .
they are awesome and super professional .
rao ' s is famous for that .
so there ' s my rant about this library .
. and the prices are beyond reasonable .
i love this yoga studio !
it kept beeping back at me .
"like others said , paint chipping off the walls ."
everything was very delicious .
the next was the massage .
the shoestring fries are my 0nd fav .
she made the experience even better !
i would ride in a dc cab any time !
everything we ate was delicious !
i thought this was really good .
she was very attentive and sweet .
so a big thumbs up for hustling us in .
i wo n't be trying this place again .
"the atmosphere is cute , artsy and pretty comfortable ."
"other than that , great !"
the meat of course was beyond amazing .
i really needed extra protein yesterday so <UNK> !
. the smell of pho .
it was very unnecessary and a waste of time .
one less thing to worry about .
. just like any other hot dog .
i will be a loyal customer now !
of course the food was good .
food is fresh and a huge selection .
the starbucks helped too !
it definitely deserves its 0 stars !
the specials they have for lunch are fantastic !
i am very pleased with the results .
but you will be back .
went in to get my lip pierced .
give that man a raise !
the buffet breakfast was horrific .
everyone was quite pleased with what they ordered .
its all pork fat already - rrb - .
i walked up to order my food .
"never fear , they make theirs in house ."
the pork chops were like hockey pucks .
we arrived and were quickly seated .
i just drove to vegas from california .
the bathrooms are pretty gross .
the vitamins and b00 made me feel fantastic !
my food was completely blah .
the rolls itself were good .
it ' s been a year and a half .
prosciutto with asparagus and <UNK> cheese .
"drinks are strong , salads are yummy ."
"was n't too sweet , just perfect ."
i will definitely be back for more .
"thanks , will come back !"
"unfortunately , just okay ."
wait a few minutes .
the soda machine is awesome though !
scallops are fabulous and drinks are always unusual .
best smoothie and wraps !
love the almond and pistachio flavors .
"since thanksgiving , my microwave has stopped working ."
he is also an honest mechanic .
all have been a high disappointment .
"however , i was not disappointed ."
super expensive and not necessarily fair trade !
a few tables opened up around 0pm .
it was also the perfect portion for me .
it ' s still really good though .
"one towel , one <UNK> ."
"hey , check out the menu !"
everyone at the office was nice and pleasant .
i want food and drinks .
best guac i have had in las vegas !
"the people are informative , and know their stuff ."
they charge $ 00 to share a plate .
their sashimi <UNK> all the rest .
my only complaint is very minor .
overall an awesome experience .
this is my gym .
the staff is very friendly and loves our baby .
friendly staff and a pet birthday club too .
the gesture was <UNK> .
"more than anything else , i loved the concept ."
i informed her we were paying customers .
"delicious food , friendly service ."
boy was i wrong .
"so , it ' s getting 0 stars ."
it was fresh and high quality .
definitely a go to !
i have never had worst service .
but the server was very nice .
i was surprised at the variety on their menu .
i heard him <UNK> with gray line to help .
it was pretty cool .
what an amazing experience !
first given room on <UNK> floor - disappointing .
pro : all very flavorful .
i wish i could give this place ten stars .
their last saving grace was the viet iced coffee !
"regardless , i enjoyed it ."
i will definitely make this a frequent stop .
it caters to vegans out there for sure .
we were absolutely underwhelmed .
the food is kinda overpriced ... but decently good .
they also really enjoy the chalk wall !
he was very patient with us .
you might not want to come here .
"not the best , but definitely the most fun ."
the service was the best part .
ribs were a bit salty but tender .
i would definitely check them out .
the flavors are wonderful & potent .
my kids love the outdoor pool and summer camp .
i ca n't remember the name of it !
would and will hire him again for new work .
also the service was pretty bad .
always very welcoming and comforting as well .
"although a bit greasy , it was really good ."
we left very dirty & old .
i would go again for a quick bite .
the woman at register asked for your name .
i was surprised how clean they keep their cars .
definitely coming back to xs ! ! ps .
jalapeã ± os add a nice spicy touch !
only downfall : you can still smoke inside .
the baristas are nice and down to earth .
. got in for free .
i found the decor mildly horrendous .
worth the extra drive .
there were a lot compared to the show .
he did n't toss the dough .
taste of the coffee was very good though .
all i can say is ... .
the cake was gone in minutes !
even in the kitchen the cabinets can fit everything .
dr . smith is amazing .
00 minutes after arriving we finally had our dessert .
this store is pretty awesome .
the staff and the food <UNK> <UNK> !
tried a <UNK> of everything and nothing tasted fresh .
the coffee drinks were refreshing .
"overall for fast food , i was ok ."
i am so glad i did !
i dont understand the peanuts in there though ... .
i love the sugar factory that recently opened up .
i love my new go walk 0 shoes .
not over salty or over done !
friend ordered a <UNK> .
i ordered the mahi mahi tacos .
gorgeous ! ! we are saving it for dessert .
i could eat this all day long .
so so so so good .
it was good too .
i would eat here again .
my only gripe with this place is the parking .
"however , the quality is worth it ."
i thought that particular act was pretty unnecessary .
we had a terrible time getting a reservation .
i am so glad i did .
impeccable service and stiff cocktails !
i should ' ve gotten it on the side .
i order the pulled pork and egg sandwich .
it does n't even look appealing .
i ' d definitely recommend .
i started to wonder how clean the kitchen was .
but service was rushed .
try the seafood enchilada and fish tacos .
"after that , we barely saw him ."
the <UNK> office of all .
scaled down version of rainforest cafe !
after a few bites the whole burro fell apart .
is what we were told .
"the shrimp looks huge , but taste really hard ."
is a rather expensive but delicious revelation .
garlic naan is now a craving for me .
it was a disaster .
the staff was very friendly too .
so simple but soooo good !
"naturally , he loves it ."
i got the tofu scramble .
used them again august 0000 worst experience ever !
my husband ordered the burro & cheese enchilada plate .
we have our usuals every time .
the decor and servers are awesome !
it ' s defiantly a place i bring friends .

my mouth is still watering !
"okay , i ' ll bite ."
the old guy did my nails .
"its not amazing , but always good ."
brad is very helpful and honest !
"inside : beautiful decor , beautiful lighting ."
the rest of our stay was wonderful .
the girl upfront ca n't even answer your questions .
and you can try all of the sauces !
"also , great customer service ."
what a terrific surprise and where do i start ?
"all in all , a good experience ."
they are making sure all <UNK> are fixed .
i absolutely love this groomer !
this is the second time this happened to me .
their happy hour is awesome .
the soft and warm sea salt foccacia was insanity .
i love their hot wings .
melt in your mouth perfect .
we got sweet potato and cajun fries .
the facility was great .
cheaper than whole foods .
affordable prices - lrb - esp .
when our food came out we dug in .
they really know how to treat people here .
i was pleasantly surprised .
free garlic knot rolls or <UNK> .
i ca n't wait until more places open !
meal 0 : dinner at caesar ' s palace .
such a great concept !
are you kidding me ?
"this particular day , i had spaghetti squash casserole ."
i love the fusion nachos with kimchi
i especially liked this nutty bread they had .
what a great little place !
husband and i had lunch on the patio .
value is no longer there !
"whatever you do , do not go here ."
a grilled cheese place should cater to all ages .
they even helped me close my packages ! ! !
- rrb - between two snickerdoodle cookies .
both small in size .
"drinks were expensive , but we expected that ."
again ... long wait .
"i absolutely love , love , love ... ."
the idea is there .
did i do something wrong ?
i asked why i could n't cash out .
pool area and restrooms are kept pretty clean .
the food is so fresh and smells amazing .
ehhhh i do n't know ... .
finally something not burning my mouth .
the groomer is fantastic .
full bar was good !
"for vegas , yes ."
it was such a disappointing experience .
"very tasty , though not what we originally anticipated ."
0 meal and 0 sweet .
we will be back !
service was very attentive .
i thanked then and supposedly the appointment was booked .
they also offer taro .
once we ordered it came up fast .
this is not even close .
the rooms were clean and up to date .
the entire dish was dry .
do n't forget that pizookie too !
every dish we ordered was delicious .
"and honestly , i ' ve never been disappointed ."
the service was pretty good .
i love the strawberry water .
"everything is fresh , elegant presentation and delicious ."
"once we did , <UNK> became a favorite ."

and now our oldest kids are seen there too .
this is definitely my go-to place for shopping essentials .
we told him that there were 00 of us .
maple syrup is corn syrup .
guy ca n't take a hint .

i ca n't really speak to the service .
we ' ll be back .
so i have n't been to either one since .
my husband and i enjoyed our 0rd anniversary here .
i have had much better at other greek places .
the service was fast & friendly .
"fries , toast , my fork ."
celebrated a friend ' s birthday here !
thank you wonderful staff .
a tad bit tangy and just enough sweetness .
plus the patio is gorgeous !
it also came with a side of plain soup .
i did n't get anything .
i could have used something to dip in it !
our sales rep ed was amazing and helpful .
they have gaming and swim up blackjack tables !
the carpets looked new and smelled fresh !
we dined on the front porch .
my dad frequents this hotel often .
probably the <UNK> creme brulee i have ever had .
the hotdogs are great and service is amazing !
for two people we were rolling out of there .
we had so much fun .
this is definitely going to be our regular groomer !
the <UNK> were just amazing !
i highly recommend shopping at nordstroms .
unfortunate dinner experience last night .
it ' s not worth it !
reminded me of panna cotta .
i was not happy but rescheduled .
i definitely recommend the drinks here also .
i did n't know what to get .
they made everything really easy .
bathroom floors were dirty and nasty .
the service was quick and very friendly .
extremely helpful and very nice staff !
i love this place .
truly awful experience and will not be back !
my pancakes were beautifully presented with strawberries and cream .
i would definitely go back .
this is a really great concept with ace execution .
they also carry lots of candy .
the check-in line was pretty intense .
never going here again .
"the wings are hot , meaty , and delicious ."
it comes with salad and rice or potatoes .
they will lie to you .
think more underground cafe .
we will definitely be back ! !
they had just what he needed even finger <UNK> !
they do not have juices but do smoothies .
"first , the margaritas ."
00/00 / 00 not sure what is going on .
"for the next day , of course , duh !"
but yama takes this to a whole new level .
it gets really hot !
- 0 star off because food was meh .
they were n't charging a cover .
"i would still come back , definitely !"
for a dessert you ca n't go wrong .
it took about 00-00 minutes to get it .
there is nothing for them to do .
the pizza we received had no flavor at all .
he was told that they needed his license again .
get the new brown rice offering !
the museum always makes me happy .
i could n't even finish it .
everyone had a great time !
it ' s a great community .
they were so funky / cool .
one of the favorite spots .
nick was very nice and professional .
not sure i ' ll be back
came back and dropped off bread then left .
they set my new mattress where it was .
"it came with rice , vegetables and some garlic ."
i wish more places offered that .
also the service is always good .
in bed by 00pm .
we started with oysters rockefeller .
"love , love , love the penguin !"
foods always good and the staff is nice .
the <UNK> are the best of the best .
then when our food arrived it was cold !
do n't throw it !
"so , so obnoxious ."
this buffet wins hands down for the best service .
m the wait was less than stated .
it was absolutely inedible .
not what we were expecting .
way too many layers .
and they were wrong .
their customer service sucks .
"the restaurants are <UNK> , and staff are great !"
- lrb - since mold was found .
i checked out another bakery before coming this one .
i am so in love with this casino !
fresh bread and sandwiches .
we sat until 0:00 before someone finally greeted us .
major thumbs up ! ! um byob !
made us feel so welcomed .
small and cozy restaurant .
outdoor element made up for being in a club .
"oh well , next time i guess !"
boyfriends bone in rib eye very average if that .
i will definitely be back !

i love their iced green tea ' s .
our favorite is the <UNK> margarita .
the food was ok with average flavor .
the bathroom water had an odd smell to it .
the waffle was fluffy and moist .
i ordered a waffle .
first of all the service is questionable .
i guess it ' s take out or nothing .
thank goodness we came across executive star limousine .
decided to try something new .
this was a big plus in my book .
they could clean a little more .
i said yes but i picked what i wanted .
expensive double shot chilled patron .
they ended up being kind of tough and rubbery .
and i am definitely in the latter group .
it was surprising to find such a deal <UNK> .
the coffee is really good .
i really did n't like that .
"from my experience , they ' re always courteous ."
last year i came for my yearly eye exam .
"they ' re nice , reliable , and honest !"
they had exactly what i wanted .
' ' i ' m thrilled !
so kudos for still having your character and sanity .
<UNK> it was orgasmic !
it was a very fun and informative class .
it ' s affordable and the food never disappoints .
viva is my new go-to roasted chicken place .
would i return for another meal ?
bubble tea that is made using real tea !
and they offered two drinks on the house .
i was perpetually impressed by the music selection too .
and the dj only played techno music .
needed that after a hard week at work !
but she took my order .
they also have red velvet pancakes !
this place was amazing in every single way .
but for $ 00 ?
so wanted to try it .
we were not disappointed .
loved the atmosphere of the restaurant .
i love this little boutique !
and it was good !
pad see ew : 0.0 / 0 stars .
warning : major nostalgic bias applies to this review .
<UNK> i love this place .
it ' s a typical pizza place .
flash frozen is fine by me .
thank you so much .
it was way too crowded .
stacy is the best hair lady !
luckily it ' s lit up to warn <UNK> !
very ` ` personalized ' ' customer service .
the staff in general was very friendly .
high recommend stopping by here .
. he did n't charge us .
it was my first time here .
need to write a paper for class ?
- lrb - goodie for them !
the malbec wine she had next was better .
"nice & sweet , the way i like it ."
the aftertaste was really bad .
ca n't wait to come back !
so fresh and hot every single time !
seriously some of the best cupcakes around !
yay for trying to get a community going !
i will definitely go back .
= - rrb - almond croissant and hazelnut americano .
my friends are this way .
should i have ordered something else ?
"dark , dingy and not enough chairs ."
"the same lady came back , looking annoyed ."
the food is over priced .
good bar for food and drinks .
the griffin is easily my favorite place in vegas .
i did not have the same experience .
wish they had one closer to me .
the service is impeccable .
the animals really entertained us .
i never had to wait for a machine either .
of course we ordered the ayce .
- rrb - the portion was huge .
the beet and goat cheese were amazing !
went in and they were a little busy .
these guys are amazing !
they do not accept credit cards .
he insisted that i try it .
so glad it ' s close to home !
i wo n't go back !
i also was n't a fan of the filling .
you can not go wrong with their noodle soups .
another very successful restaurant week selection !
really pleased with this little find !
although no little bowl of sea salt .
000 $ was way too much for this show .
the server was nice to .
that ' s their office .
it was tasty and a good portion .
it was around $ 0 for his drink .
the bathrooms were quite dirty .
- rrb - and 0-0 mosquito bites .
very refreshing and cleansing .
i love this place .
do n't dress up .
i love this place .
cereal seemed like a safe choice .
it ' s not a pretty bill .
this place has delicious authentic mexican food .
"the drinks were tasty and strong , but expensive ."
"we had really , really bad service , too ."
i have to say i was underwhelmed .
"if i could give negative starts , i would ."
i love their ribs !
my husband and i like all kinds of sushi .
i ' ll definitely be back !
the staff are really friendly and helpful too !
this is our 0nd visit .
i went down again .
its nice and new !
the price is very reasonable .
the atmosphere was cool .
glad they are still in business .
i do n't recommend them .
"dry , lukewarm and small portioned ."
that ' s just too expensive !
come here every visit to vegas .
"if you have children , do not move here ."
i was however disappointed with the burrito .
the massage was great .
i will definitely be back !
"yup , $ 0 ."
they are rude and not very customer service oriented .
i also found out that friday is ladies night .
our server was excellent and so was the food .
the portions were huge !
we tried several of the saucy balls .
i would love to come back for dinner sometime .
i must say i highly recommend this place .
and the service is n't always that great .
strong while still being refreshing and elegant .
i was disappointed with this vegas restaurant .
yum milk tea with boba .
you ' ve just found it .
the atmosphere is also very nice .
"i chose hummus , <UNK> and <UNK> salad ."
i love encanto park .
nothing saved these drinks .
the restaurant is clean and loud .
their bread for the sandwiches tasted freshly baked .
the balsamic overpowered everything !
i was looking forward to fundido .
there were people behind us waiting for a table .
the food was decent .
the medical assistants are nice and professional .
definitely worth the trip !
i could just eat this and be happy .
super easy to find .
we ordered the shrimp for a house party .
"the patio is beautiful , the food is amazing ."
our waitress was such a lovely person !
charming outdoor garden seating area and friendly staff .
+ + + best cocktails .
"okay , i know people can <UNK> anything ."
way back pure used to be cool .
leek & potato it is .
they would be bringing us a <UNK> .
i also need to try their crepes .
the food was just alright .
we visited for lunch on a thursday afternoon .
this is vegas in its finest feathers .
they also have bagel sandwiches and even <UNK> salads .
you ' ll be so glad you did .
the eclair was equally delicious !
interesting to see ` ` cauliflower rice .
the rest were priced at $ 00-000 - each .
they do have a tip jar at the counter .
i have never tried filipino food before until now .
<UNK> <UNK> is amazing !
i think they might have converted me from starbucks !
"it is the ultimate , messy , satisfying meal ."
they are big too .
it ' s very calm .
hope this review was helpful .
too much frosting but it was beautifully decorated .
very affordable for the quality of work they do .
"it was <UNK> , so be very jealous !"
just not that great .
so i waited ... .
love eating here any time we are in town .
we were the only customers in the restaurant .
we were served complimentary miso soup and edamame .
. it ' s an egg place .
fancy <UNK> ooh <UNK> <UNK> !
the biggest disappointment was the buttermilk fried chicken .
and the scent stays for days .
it was mostly cabbage and veggies .
then she argued with me about it .
i got what i wanted .
i think token describes it .
the owner is very nice .
the food was worth the price .
thank you all for being amazing & awesome !
ordered a chicago dog dragged thru the garden .
i ' m supposed to feel grateful .
a near perfect sandwhich .
z is conveniently located in fashion square .
they also have an extensive amount of vegetarian options .
"also , the beignets were completely off ."
she order a <UNK> burrito .
did i only give 0 stars ?
if you need to stock up come here !
- service : they have really great service here .
everything is broken when we moved in .
so glad it ' s a block from home !
it was just right .
customer service is amazing !
the deluxe suite was decently spacious for 0 people .
the spinach chicken waldorf salad is amazing !
this one i had no problems drinking or finishing .
highly recommend using them !
though i still like sky harbor better .
the massage holy relaxation batman .
an unpretentious <UNK> kind of place .
it never comes out hot anymore .
those two guys are amazingly strong and fit .
beautiful in the daylight and absolutely stunning at night !
beautiful they made us feel so special and pampered .
no names are taken .
both were very good and actually complimented one another .
"it ' s a snooze , right ?"
when she finally brought it .
i love bobby flay !
we will always ask for daniel k . .
i had the <UNK> and he had the <UNK> .
and let ' s see .
every girl wears a little dress .
definitely recommend others call them as well !
it ' s so good !
order the pad thai .
the staff was extremely friend and knowledgable .
we had a great time here .
you ca n't be overdressed here .
"the check in was fast , efficient and easy !"
enough ratio of cheese to toppings to crust .
items we ordered : guacamole made table side .
that ' s a plus .
service was friendly and attentive .
horchata was a big hit at my table .
"oh , you know i do !"
there were 0 pools and lots of children .
my new favorite spot !
"also , there is n't much content in it ."
this place has everything a kid could love .
<UNK> even marquee bouncers have more respect than you .
"it is a very , very small restaurant ."

even before i went the vegetarian / vegan route .
these donuts tasted like non-vegan donuts !
ca n't go wrong .
this place definitely deserves 0 stars .
the hush puppies ca n't be beat .

' ' she did n't and he was off .
do not waste your money or time here .
"hello ? ? ? acrobats , <UNK> !"
food always comes out <UNK> ' fresh .
or has calamari become a shellfish ?
"first , the food i had here was amazing ."
"<UNK> gent , madison , wi"
never will i ever shuttle with bell trans again .
it ' s not the best area .
totally took my money for a shitty drink .
i wo n't be back .
i wanted to buy it all !
by that point i could n't even eat .
there was n't a huge selection of dark chocolates .
one of my favorite places to eat .
and the answering service has no explanation for this .
the employees are beyond terrible .
i paid my bill went and sat out side .
it was different and somewhat tasty .
"mongolian beef , garlic chicken and the chow mien ."
"though , we did order the diamond ice ."
overall it is visually and <UNK> stunning !

"the omelet was nice , light and fluffy ."
"it is definitely worth trying out once , though ."

"fresh spinach , cheese and a delicious verde sause ."
"trust me , you will love this place !"

the caramel mascarpone cheesecake won me over !
the remaining items were a huge disappointment though .
the smell was that strong .
this place is amazing !
a must seen in vegas .
this place definitely did the trick after dinner !
our food came out wrong and he blamed us !
also the prices here are incredibly cheap .

"my cousin , who lives here ; suggested it ."
i love dj <UNK> and dj karma .
there were few other tables occupied when we arrived .
food not so much .

this was my first time here .
i highly recommend the fish tacos and horchata .
snooty and irritated to be asked to help .
the manager chatted with us too .
"sad to say , i did not ."
"the burgers , fries and drinks were good ."
it was not that impressive .
been there many times !
just ate here for the first time .
he said it was nowhere to be found .
this place is awesome !
doubt you could go wrong w anything on the menu
what if you order in ?
i was completely unimpressed with the veggie pizza though .
for the side i had sweet potato tater tots .
great club to cut loose and dance !
they at least take care of their members .
i will not be back .
' ' this club has it all .
"the service , the food !"
we called the company to complain .
here ' s the topper !
which was a super sweet thing to do .

i love a decent taco spot .
just got back from dinner at rooster ' s .

so this review offers insight for 0 different <UNK> .
the lanes and shoes here are very slippery .
"not okay , coriander ."
of course i passed !
there were four servers for our table .

awful ambiance and bad location .
i think next time i would try mango .
we also love the tuna poke tower .
never apologizing for our bad service .
the salad was tasty too .
i also tried a bite of my cousins karaage .
the bartender was really friendly as well .
". hispanic <UNK> loitering around , too ."
thank you again for all you have done .
so i assume it was good .
they ' re that good .
the pilgrim was very delicious .
the crust was perfect .
i had the brownie swirl .
my neighbors yelling at us to come out .
it makes the pain and little less !
i do n't care .

i love places with personality !
i was sorely disappointed .
"fresh , soft and melted in my mouth !"
it feels dead inside .
"very cute stuff , too ."
both fresh and tasty !
. just gawking at that poor go-go dancing girl .
i burned our costco pizza and the kids cried .
so on to the food review .
the beds were sinking in .
she did not apologize one time .
it almost gave the barrymore <UNK> .
simply ca n't complain !
i absolutely love this store !
my friend order the salmon with scampi .
i will not be ordering from here again .
especially in 000 degree weather .
i was a little underwhelmed by this place .
i spent 0 hours here and it was great !
it ' s worth the taxi ride .
apparently that is not an option .
we come here for the cherry crumb pie .

"no , i mean it ."
the staff was really nice .
i tried to look up the menu online .
i really enjoyed the cheesecake and carrot cake .
"on the plus side , the service was great !"
so i went to the back .
this was more like a dessert than a beverage .
perfect dinner for date night !
and i hate little caesar ' s .
got the shrimp chips as my side .
make sure you order the yuzu / melon soda !
i always have a stomach ache when leaving .
"overall , i will probably always stay here ."
nothing about this meal was disappointing !
we were not disappointed .
the chicken ones were ok but a little plain .
"instead , he insulted us ."
"however , you can bring your own !"
we booked this online so buyer beware !
if i could put down 0 stars i would .
pasta bar used to be better .
"it was pretty crowded , as expected ."
very pleasant and helpful hotel staff .

menu is n't too big .
i hope this business is successful .

"we ordered beef , chicken and pork ."
we defiantly will eat here again !
busy busy busy place !

the mango snow was really good !
i am incredibly fed up .
i did not stay at this hotel .

definitely a nice space for a cocktail bar .
owners are super friendly and nice .
' ' made me laugh !
i highly recommend them .
i believe this is what happened to my burger .
i was the one calling them .
especially the maple sauce :d !
the restaurant itself has a modern yet organic feel .
small and boxed in pool area .
this restaurant is probably my favorite right now .
the green tea was my favorite .
very happy with this place .
excellent but a little pricy for what you get .
i will have to try a cocktail too !
you definitely wo n't leave hungry .
great price and fills me up .
love the beer here and love the people .
- rrb - hubby liked it a lot .
i will not be going back for some time .
yum this place is cool !
it ' s pretty good .
i was just <UNK> after some fried potatoes .
what a great show !
i do n't recommend that .
will never go back .
there were suprisingly alot of people here .
the linens were amazing and so soft .
ask for brandon <UNK> to be your food server .
very disappointed in the food !
i admired the beer selection while we waited .
everyone is rather well behaved .
they ' re my last hope out there .
they probably have it .
i nibbled on these firecracker shrimp things .
this is my favorite hotel to be in .

it was perfect for dipping my fries .
this place is gross .
we all loved everything .

"beautiful selection of handmade jewelry , many local <UNK> ."
le reve has acrobats and dance .
service was very attentive and also kid friendly .
the waitresses are so nice and personable .
ca n't wait to try their other choices .
the whole wheat pancake was uneventful .
i then called corporate .
the only thing i would change is the bread .
nice classier vibe club .
servers are really sweet .
all of which were filled with flavor .
this place has gone downhill the last couple months .
you have to try the creamed corn !
the atmosphere was fun and casual .
they are soooo delicious !
but - i forgive this little place .
we had our order within minutes .
the service was spot on !
i loved the scalp part .
now they have nothing !
"it ' s casual , easy , and tasty ."

i ' ve learned from experience ; - rrb -
the staff was very accommodating in this as well .
they have great china mist iced tea as well .

kevin was very nice and professional .
i most especially love their shrimp tempura .

lots of shade on the spacious patio .
we had the super nachos and a chimichanga plate .
the prices are really affordable to rent too .
really good sandwich even if a little salty .
they really believe in <UNK> .
service was great as well .
it was all delicious !
"also , today their service was pretty slow ."

i love the vibe in this place !
the salad also comes with bread .

i enjoyed the side salads his dish came with .
fried pickles - win .
now that is respect for your customers .
. both were perfect !
the only bakery in charlotte worth throwing money at .
i just went this week end with a friend .
she knows her stuff will exceed all your expectations !
mine looked nothing like the picture .
even mom and pop store accept <UNK> .
everything on the menu is delicious .
"good food selection , my faves : crab legs ."
looking forward to trying their drop in yoga class .
we waited so long we literally decided to walk .
so our order got pushed back .
"first , my review of her lasagna ."
"anyway , i did n't appreciate her attitude ."
i dislike the 0 - eleven brand jerky .
the taste was nice and sweet .
only negative is the weekend rush .
this place is insanely delicious .
great food and atmosphere !
okay ... where to start .
did n't get drinks for 00 minutes .
i <UNK> so go there again .
looked on yelp and found this restaurant .
i love the triple george !
and hella dark too .
get anything pulled pork .
that ' s saying a lot !

very quick and friendly !
it was pretty good .
"wow , i was really surprised by this place ."
i will be back !
i love this place .
this drink was delicious !
the menu is extensive and a little overwhelming .
top notch food and service !

i have going to this rest .
"gorgeous , swanky , and excellent customer service ."
hopefully there will be other people there as well .
i truly recommend them for personal training !
it was interesting but super salty .
was really good food would come back .
they even threw the spicy shrimp in for free !
seriously i ca n't rave about it enough .
my favorites were the bacon-wrapped sirloin and chicken !
we both really did not like the crust .
the prices are affordable and the service is friendly .
i probably wo n't try it again .
we decided to go with a 00oz margarita .
the desserts and dessert wine were top notch .
"finally , another healthy place open for dinner !"
and had the worst experience .
i would go back for this goulash .
the staff are very helpful .
i will be back !
it cured me from going back .
. all the waiters were very friendly and accommodating .
but having a big bathroom just makes everything better !
"chicken , tuna , egg etc . ."
he would n't give up at no either .
it was so good .
"but other than that , the food was good ."
"levels 0-0 are free , levels 0-00 are extra ."
this place has grown on me .
everyone who works there is so kind great service .
lack luster at best .

had a wonderful dinner with a very large party .
this place is amazing !
i love everything i have tried so far .
i seriously recommend you go .

two girls were behind the counter prepping .
our drink <UNK> were bone dry .
the quality was spectacular and everything was super fresh .
the yellow curry was delicious !
you been serving it all day .
they were kind of sweet .
not worth the money .
we sat in the back room .
lots of beige and pinks though .
thai cuisine was my first experience with thai .
awe thanks that was so generous .
i recommend this show to adults / dates .

he also got a mojito which was good .
great value and taste to go with it !
i ' ve been here twice .
"the wine bottle chandeliers are really cool , too ."
the community focus is evident on their shelves .
sky harbor has upped their restaurant game !
they also do day care and boarding !
the front desk clerks were very helpful and friendly .
"well , whatever ... perfect timing ."
will i be back ?
the sight seeing is okay .
i think this is our new saturday spot .
deli meat is cut fresh big plus .
prob the best panang in town
' ' and so i ordered it medium rare .
that ' s all we needed to know .
the music for dancing was pretty great .
i am getting full just thinking about it .
oh and $ 0 for a kids popcorn ?
i do have to say the food was good .
"therefore , i will definitely be back again ."
he wanted to just go to denny ' s .
it almost felt like two scoops .
i purchased strawberries - lrb - delish !
everyone was so accommodating and patient .
i was not impressed at all .
i can not recommend him enough .
i will not spend money here again !
i actually liked his order of sesame chicken more .
he polished off my dish when i got full .
"the service was good , friendly , and attentive ."
service has improved and the food has been fantastic !
it ' s that serious .
i will continue to come back to this place .
i needed a good dermatologist to remove this .
stopped in very last minute .
you ' ll be so happy you did .
"thank you , brandon for all you did !"
pretty brave on our parts !
how is this place still in business ?
"they were again completely flavorless , but warmer ."
it ' s great for family or big groups .
does anyone remember when this place was safari nightclub ?
"the staff , however , completely ruined my stay ."
i enjoyed the lobster specialty and it was amazing !
i like red robin .
every person who touched our table was absolutely fantastic .

the pickles on the side where even amazing haha .
great happy hour very inexpensive .
nobody at the counter .
i literally live right behind them .
the prices are very reasonable too .
left a sour taste in my mouth .
my problem with this bosa is the customer service .
"sad , just sad !"
there is something about gaucho that makes me drool .
- lrb - do n't judge me .
this place was delicious .
"the club itself is small , but nice ."
i could n't believe my eyes .
i love the burger and bacon board .
um spicy garlic cheese bread ?
and the part that makes me upset .
do not eat here !
just got back from a bachelorette trip in vegas .
"the wrap was alright , but mediocre ."
"service is great , everyone is very friendly too ."
we had - california roll ... .
a bit unprofessional and uncomfortable .
definitely would n't waste time or money there again .
the drinks are amazing .
i said this is my first time here .
"unfortunately , service at this location is exceptionally lacking ."
omg ! ! ! best thing hands down .
he was that impressive !
think i will go this sunday .
* stock up on <UNK> and <UNK> soap .
the coolest spot in vegas !
we left after an hour .
"till next vegas trip , wynn buffet !"
"thought it was just ok , nothing <UNK> ."
can you say oh my god good !
it was cold and delicious .
it was borderline dry and crispy .
we walk in and are immediately seated .
the french fries were my favorite .
i look forward to going to the dentist .
i just will never ever come here again .
service was a little slow / not ideal .
camden canyon apartments are very nice inside .
. $ 0000 a month for this trash !
the food is legitimate !
they serve buckwheat gluten-free crepes .
do yourself a favor and go elsewhere !
resort fee $ 00 is not worth it .
"however , the service is terrible ."
we had b00 and b00 passes .
shrimp arrived ready to eat !
high school ... blech !
endless mimosas till 0pm is n't bad either !
probably wo n't be back .
you ' ve been warned .
and kind of a jerk that day lol .
it ' s clean and <UNK> .
"yes , you can get takeout ."
live music taking requests and jamming all night .
"at this point , i was pretty upset ."
you taking notes here ?
you could shoot right at the pins !
: - rrb - definitely coming back !
my new car is amazing too by the way !
"but other then that , i love marquee !"
she told us that it was 000 calories !
not worth the $ 00.00 we paid .
passion fruit margarita was good .
everything is homemade including the rolls and desserts .
the staff is very friendly as well !
i thoroughly enjoyed the classic rock too .
we got right in at 0:00 .
: - rrb - this kfc sucks !
the service is friendly and the food is great !
this is my favorite coffee shop .
it ' s rare these days to find that !
plus the food court is pretty great !
must stop lunch spot !
"it ' s nothing spectacular , though ."
we sat at a table on the patio .
i came here for brunch on a sun .
drinks were expensive and not good .
and check the thermostat on your <UNK> already !
will definitely be back !
"beside the five-star service , this place is gorgeous ."
i love me some good cheese .
. but it makes you want it more !
. our waiter and wait staff were excellent !
"had a suite , great set up ."
i have had two sprinkles experiences .
it was mostly vinegar .
"they were nice , helpful in the complex ."
very comfortable and welcoming vibe .
<UNK> brothers & guess who .
our friends got the filet and chicken for entrees .
not the case this time !
they have a huge selection of bikes .
and it was sooo good !
boy was i wrong .
we came in at about 00am on a weekday .
good service and food .
the atmosphere is great !
it ' s absolutely beyond me .
stayed here for three nights in late june .
this theater really was amazing .
the butter was cold and hard .
same with bananas and brown sugar in a pancake .
"thoughtful menu is small , and everything looked delicious ."
"seriously , can not go wrong at the trump ."
not plush and kind of stiff .
"additionally , service was great !"
it ' s not a matter of sneezing .
regular fries were great .
each sphere holds up to 00 people .

i love the feel of this bright cheery resturaunt .
"they have juices , smoothies and acai bowls ."
<UNK> are always very friendly !
whats up here in arizona ?
"me : okay , i wo n't ."
my family will not be coming back .
to start the bread alone was amazing .
i will definitely be back on my next trip .
for our appetizer we ordered the crab cake .
the glass was even clean !
i asked him why he ate it ?
if you have any class or integrity about you .
the food was excellent !
it is perfect and i can never get enough .
food was really good too .
way too sweet and artificial tasting .
was n't gross but was n't good .
the buttercream icing was n't too sweet .
we ate here with friends during restaurant week .
service was friendly and fast .
they had it ready .
huge portions and huge menu with lots of options .
i most likely will not be going back .
well we did n't really think things through .
we were sad to leave .
that ' s three more than i played !
definitely their dishes were inconsistent .
we got a spacious room with a comfy bed .
not once have i heard anyone complain .
we shared a fried chicken sandwich which was outstanding .
nice small and cozy .
not worth the wait .
wo n't ever be back .
tonight was a new beginning .
"for pork , line up on the right !"
a + + + fast friendly service !
we proceeded to find a table .
we ' ve only done take-out .
not if you ask me .
my emails would be overlooked and concerns not addressed .
"it was good the next day , though !"
sadly i only ate at two of them lol .
very big outdoor mall !
"i love you , extra lounge !"
but know that different <UNK> view it differently .
the wait staff was always very attentive and friendly !
it was messy but it tasted so good .

. which i actually prefer .
did i mention how great the bed was ?
"overall , liked it a lot ."
the hostess <UNK> is super sweet and competent !
this place is great !
the music was great !
i will not return .
the only positive was the customer service was good .
she was so nice and accommodating .
it was the most frustrating thing in the world .
the quality of the cleaning itself has been decent .
we will continue to visit both locations .
the espresso was layered with different tones and flavors .
overall a get what you pay for situation .
the amount of meat was al <UNK> disappointing .
i really like the decor and set up .
"= - rrb - very cheap , awesome food !"
emailed the store but have n't heard back yet .
we were literally yelling back and forth to communicate .
"it was good , not great ."
"which is probably bad , but oh so good !"
extremely slow delivery and the food is mediocre .
i could go on and on !
the rice and beans were tasty too .
meatloaf sandwich was good .
i only wished we had tried the polenta sticks .
the coffee one was sinful .
i will just try another teacher .
its a ca n't - miss .

i love that it has a <UNK> loop .
the lobster <UNK> was just alright .
we should n't have to wait .
"overall , i ' d definitely recommend this gym ."
the exhibit was pretty awesome .
the vibe is very clean and modern !

this place at first glance was just that .
i would go back just for that .
the food here is so good .
i love them and will continue to go there .
the bad experiences : 0 .
i want to stay here !
there was definitely a language barrier .

a must go place if you are in chandler .
their fries are nicely seasoned .
the gym has everything needed for great workouts .
i ' ve always had an excellent experience .
they really should have comped us .
"i like the vibe , the attention to detail ."
they did nothing else !
the selection in their little grocery section is inspirational .
her tattoo turned out amazing as well .
great performance by all .
that was $ 00 down the drain for me .
i would n't use anyone else !
the decor is really basic .
lol love their sandwiches .
you can be in and out within an hour .
our stay here just started .
there were 0 people in our party .
we also ordered two desserts .
eight pounds of golden delicious apples for $ 0 !

the food was okay .
i adore <UNK> <UNK> .
"no , i did n't get a freaking parade ."
the only cute thing here is the decor .

"super helpful , very friendly , incredibly professional ."
everything else just tasted of disappointment .
the ginger vodka drink was amazing .
the people who work here are all cantonese .
the place is small however the staff is <UNK> !
pierogies lacked a bit of flavor .
it was nearly empty and it was freezing inside .
the food was really terrific .
"it ' s a <UNK> restaurant , after all ."
the buttons did n't always turn on the lights .
"good job guys , thank you very much !"

more options and more for my money too .
the ube cheese came was delicious .
this place drives me crazy in a good way .

the atmosphere was okay .
i ' m getting real tired of it .
i will definitely be ordering from here again !
the flan was delicious .
this place was absolutely horrible .
the banana pudding was good though .
we will definitely be returning !
i ca n't say enough nice things about them !
but i still loved that part anyway .
the food taste mediocre .
we will all follow wherever they go .
one star for you .
i give this place two thumbs up !
the pumpkin is my favorite .
i ' ve made another appt .
the atmosphere is nice too .
it was in large portions .
the staff was rude and very unprofessional .
this place is so amazing !
ended up pay $ 000 for just one room .
give it a try !
my husband loves this course .
one of my favorite libraries .
"my thought was cool , this might work !"
i do n't believe anything here is really healthy .
wings are plump and juicy and crispy .
the decorations are very japanese .
great items - classy and trendy .
and this location has an awesome patio !
overall our server and food was great .
"i despise everything about you , miracle mile ."
it did n't feel heavy or <UNK> .
decor is seriously cool .
the staff is very friendly and helpful .
mix was a great experience .
and tasted so fresh and tasty !
back to your suite ?
the best though was their chicken & kale soup .
decided to try this place on a friday night .
the breaker to that outlet was broken .
they ' re <UNK> little fried pillows of deliciousness .
"dude , invest in a new machine !"
however we where slightly drunk and on foot .
all this for under $ 00 .
we ordered the mimosa cocktail and it was okay .
the atmosphere is fun .
"bathroom decor was crazy cool , by the way ."
their products are all natural .
the guacamole is none like i ' ve had .
i would n't hesitate to come back .
such a great fun place to hang out .
a couple friends recommended this place so we went .
the portions are crazy huge so plan on sharing .
it was intensely dry .
decent sized glasses of wine and good service .
"so , so good !"
the restaurant is clean and pretty .
its a really nice small shop with great atmosphere .
not sure why people freak out over that .
very friendly and helpful .
i tried the southwest chicken salad .
the gilbert house was an awesome find !
not appetizing at all .
the broth is soo comforting !
it ' s really just ok .
do n't forget the chocolate cups are delightfully edible .
i honestly do n't know .
definitely my favorite starter .
i love that little spot .
i was with him on that one .
"finally , he stops by our table ."
the drinks were okay .
. and every time im here .
just those took over 00 minutes !
this was a total scam !
- lrb - huge kudos for that .
a bit too smokey for my taste .
i had a bowl of ` ` combination pho .
in short - a perfect <UNK> brunch option !
it ' s sushi time .
i just had 0 vehicles detailed today !
i ' ve never experienced anything like that before .
it was perfect timing .
like a <UNK> lobster funnel cake .
they are professional and on point .
"funny , sexy , and amazing acrobatics ."
i did have an excellent makeup experience at sephora .
i ' m already craving it again !
we had flatbreads to start .
megan was our server .
"as we got closer , our hearts sank ."
the floor manager urged us to play .
i hope they stay there forever .
i now regret not watching him sooner .
she ended up doing a lot .
maybe you can order extra cheese ?
they talked amongst themselves and texted for an hour .
"other than that , great place to eat !"
"well sorry my friends , it was sadly not !"
it was a blast .
green curry was great too !
love the b00 mix .
someone should have told me about this happy hour !
it smelled good in there !
"seriously , you could get lost in here ."
this is a hidden gem in surprise !
my friends and i came here after the club .
the fish was delicious !
"a true professional , and he made great cocktails !"
we enjoyed a great hamburger .
get there early to beat the heat !
"the service at the hotel is great , too ."
its a little strong .
wish they were n't closing at 0 .
went here for my birthday with my family .
i stop in maybe twice a month .
i got the pasta bowl with sausage .
the bathroom did n't live up to my standards .
! ! i love this place .
"he was very apologetic , though ."
um its not and shes 00 !
and the house dressing is wonderful .
i threw my whole order away and walked out .
a real steal for las vegas !
at least i did .
also - free wifi !
i paid for it over the phone .
we also love their sushi .
my only beef with 000 east is the service .
i will not return .
this is very cool !
i was literally in and out within minutes .
make ' em extra spicy !
i love lola ' s on central .
"thank you so much , julia !"
"unlike the other poster , i loved gina !"
the employees do not know what they are doing .
the signature really did feel like a luxury hotel !
loved that the chips were served hot .
just right amount of sweetness with salty taste .
will not return to this location again .
i took my kids for dinner tonight .
the decor was bright and wonderful .
wo n't be ordering again .
horrible <UNK> service from the <UNK> manager .
i did n't come here to sit .
omg i am such a fatty !
i particularly loved the ahi poke .
we go about 0x a week at least .
it was mega greasy .
you ca n't beat it !
the dessert was weird .
they have about 000 different flavors .
"use <UNK> bathroom , do n't use their ."
you must try the green bean casserole !
i love she used eco friendly products .
i usually order the snow white or taro smoothies .
one of my favorite places .
"0 stars for drinks , 0 stars for ambiance ."
the price of such a dining experience ?
"she told me yes , they had cheesecake ."
my husband and i are not vegas veterans .
so i drove over .
loved this place and the extreme adventure !
we paid full price .
for us it was a great neighborhood find .
the complimentary rolls are very good too .
"great food , atmosphere , and service !"
i <UNK> wanted some minestrone soup !
so what does he prescribe ?
the staff were lovely and helpful .
that is about it .
i ca n't remember what the cocktail was called .
went with a couple friends to have a brunch .
went to see a movie last night here .
and every single thing was delicious .
so much to choose from .
do n't suites have more than one room ?
not to mention what a fabulous staff they have .
. love this place !
just keep it clean i say !
i could n't finish my food .
i always come back for more !
the actual office staff is rude and short .
i had the shrimp salad and it was horrible .
they also accept credit cards !
i had never been here either .
they have so many classes for the whole family .
it made no sense .
"silly , i know ."
i love the family ambiance and good service .
<UNK> - nothing memorable .
i plan to go back for the foie gras !
well ladies and gents .
then we waited and waited and waited .
there is a free shuttle from 00-0 .
i ' m still excited to recommend this place .
like dessert for the breakfast we just ate .
the best vet in town by the way .
we were able to be seated <UNK> .
please do not drink them if driving .
the service i had there was not that great .
the meat is tender and flavorful .
the sushi is very popular here .
"needless to say , i was already full ."
there was even a bathroom attendant !
"a total dive , but i like dives ."
this review is solely for their happy hour .
i just had that blank look - rrb - .
update : we all ended up with <UNK> afterwards
so happy i finally got to try this place .
i ca n't wait to go back !
it ' s overall a ok restaurant .
i finally made it downtown glendale last night .
she received a new drink but no apology .
they were on it with their service .
i am always happy with the service here .
what a dining experience !
. and did i mention its super cheap ?
it was a waste .
"made it nice and tangy , thanks jamba juice ."
so happy with my haul !
beware of becky and jen .
very rude and inconsiderate .
i got all carrots .
the oysters are pretty fresh .
ours was a totally impromptu visit .
"great atmosphere , very attentive service from <UNK> ."
i love you <UNK> !
the pool area is divine ... .
maybe she said salsa ?
"monica was our server , she is the best !"
will definitely go back ... again and again !
i will definitely be back here now .
you ' ll enjoy anything you get from here !
my husband loves the <UNK> pork and hunan chicken .
customer service is super .
"seriously , i highly recommend !"
my mother in law got a salad with chicken .
it ' s a huge property with three pools .
anything you order is delish .
i started getting really sick and almost blacked out .
seriously the portion is huge !
food was soooooo good i ca n't even begin .
their kids portion sizes are really big .
the service was also genuinely warm and professional .
they also rotated them for me .
jason the bartender was amazing !
i ordered the chicken chile chowder .
so good all around !
i will go back just because of that !
like we were ruining her day by ordering food .
his <UNK> group is the best !
we will definitely be back !
mine decided to stop working <UNK> .
waited close to an hour for food .
. but they were friendly peeps .
we decided to use our groupon last weekend .
i also order some macaroni salad .
"very nice , friendly , always remembers us !"
owner was friendly and down to earth .
and my second favorite scene were the <UNK> <UNK> .
the food is stellar !
the window was huge .
- rrb - i am disappointed .
were n't sure what to do .
we embarrassingly forgot where we parked .
"also , the waiter was really really annoying ."
waiter pat was great but the queso was awful .
"minimalist vibe , sexy lighting ."
great and friendly service .
they said 00 - 00 minutes more .
went in today and they were super busy .
"expect to wait in line , but worth it ."
yummy in my tummy .
i think you missed something .
there were no other vegetables in it .
the cauliflower soup is so good !
bacon anonymous here i come .
soo cute and unbelievable service .
but welcome takes comfort food to another level .
i would go again and probably try their pizza .
who wants that kind of breath ?
we both had burgers .
brittany was even more abrasive .
the restaurant also has a musty cheesy smell .
so far the transition has been perfect .
perfect for a summer day .
roadside rally is my favorite burger on the menu .
office staff was very accommodating and polite .
"yes , you read that right ."
the atmosphere is nice too .
however the food was not good .
i think i will eat there friday !
i got the french toast and pumpkin spice donuts .
you wo n't be disappointed !
the dj killed it .
the service was truly amazing .
i would n't go there again .
he was very arrogant and rude .
he said he has it in his kitchen .
we have never had a hard time getting parking .
they communicated with us if somebody wanted a discount .
good place to study .
"plus , it ' s 00 hours ."
ribs - 0/0 yikes .
: - lrb - the bathroom was interesting .
i think my boyfriend had the cannelloni .
i wonder how well that would work .
prices are reasonable too !
the flavors are expansive and the desserts ... yum !
i loved our server .
i love love love this little charcuterie booth .
service was friendly and our sweets were yummy .
i ordered the mac n cheese with no mushrooms .
it was like an interactive club so to speak .
. well i love their vanilla parfait !
the decor is truly beautiful .
absolutely worth the money .
"awesome food , great price and great service !"
i definitely did n't dread going there .
his fries were thin and seasoned .
the room looks like an upscale cafe .
how slow can a restaurant be ?
. they ' re naked .
lots of parking here except during the christmas season .
it was not the waitress who brought them .
he seems really young and inexperienced .
. they ' re so adorable .
i only had drops for 0 more days .
"sometimes , less is more !"
you seriously wo n't be disappointed .
the bartender tonight did a fabulous job .
we had a great time .
the sushi was amazing and the service was excellent .
the young woman at the desk was just lovely .
chef ' s specials were so delicious .
the decor and atmosphere are wonderful too !
i just left right now and nothing .
. she kept up on everything .
who does n't love craft stores ?
thanks <UNK> :] love love love this place !
he ' s so sweet !
the cold sake was smooth and refreshing .
they contacted my friend and were very gracious .
avoid the lemongrass chicken !
my favorite may have been the diving group .
it was more beautiful than i had ever imagined !
super delicious food & great service .
it ' s a small place but very intimate .
i would def like to come back .
there were no emergencies and it was not busy .
thank you for another epic experience !
great local coffee house .
the drinks are always perfect .
i proceeded to make a happy plate !
my sister is a huge fan of this place .
our waiter was also very friendly and attentive .
i really still like it here .
i always get extra toppings !
this place is way too expensive .
drinks are also on point !
i wanted every gem in the gem room .
options for every diet here !
you know what i mean .
love their gluten free menu .
our experience at <UNK> was anything but - <UNK> .
i had no idea what i was missing .
everything was super flavorful and everyone was super friendly .
i had the turkey avocado croissant sandwich .
it was stuffed full of yummy veggies and meat .
an excessive amount of noise .
so really it ' s fast food ?
had their salmon which was yummy !
"well , they ran out ."
we ordered eggplant parmigiana and spaghetti marinara .
highly recommended if you ' re in the area !
this place is great !
incredibly flavorful and fresh ingredients .
the food was absolutely delicious .
more cakey then bread but still good .
maybe the chick never ate sushi before .
i love the south side bbq company !
"00 dollars for a sandwich , salad and drink ."
do n't forget to try their house sake .
. i think i paid around $ 00 ?
too much hype with this night club .
"definitely worth the trip , but go early ."
resisted the sweet tea .
that tells me she is an inexperienced stylist .
still it was tasty .
the food was okay .
mmmm such a great find !
this exhibit was so cool !
"fresh , fresh , fresh fresh !"
i ' ve thought about what i would order .
"it was rather wonderful , really ."
to talk with her .
i told her i was quoted $ 00 .
it was still pretty busy .
"seriously , that ' s some attentive service ."
you had me at salsa bar .
"ok , maybe one : awesome !"
"of course , that was a lie ."
"excellent service , delicious food , clean and spacious !"
looking forward to next time .
this is a great place for sushi .
i will never return to this location .
no mention of anything was wrong .
hubby was in seventh heaven .
and no squeezed lime either .
i know it ' s obvious .
but i would definitely come back here for brunch !
"then , you ' re just creepy like me ."
"so , that was a downer ."
my brother really enjoyed the shake .
light and fluffy yet crunchy at the same time .
"in conclusion , will not come back again ."
i am not expecting a quiet brunch .
the service was very attentive & welcoming .
which is too bad because i like apple dumplings .
or maybe it ' s the bad service ... .
park at charlie ' s next store .
love the ambiance and the food is amazing .
he was funny and also very respectful .
this was a half hour before the show .
i crave this falafel .
i definitely would not recommend this place !
it was not good .
they are friendly and very accommodating .
best happy hour in henderson !
pulled pork delicious as well .
i am so relieved .
the shrimp and grits was delicious .
i ' ll definitely be coming back !
same goes for the provolone wheel .
"well , my boyfriend , but still pretty cool ."
. it only had carne eggs n cheese .
the decor is very aesthetically pleasing .
a + + + + service !
they charge $ 00 for dinner .
so hospitable and helpful .
definitely staying here anytime we go to phoenix .
its more of a dill potato salad .
everything i ' ve had here has been amazing .
the promoters are not good .
no longer on my list of restaurants to frequent .
no complaints so far !
maybe we just were n't in the mood .
my boyfriend and i shared 0 of them .
maybe we hit on a good night .
the salmon was disappointing .
so much better than regular water and <UNK> .
i usually recommend it for happy hour .
came here following a recommendation from a friend .
i absolutely love skinnyfats .
it ' s an authentic chinese restaurant !
i just wish it came in a bigger portion .
but service is fantastic .
the spoons were a nice touch !
i decided to order the california omelet .
"he was prompt , friendly and helpful ."
this year was the last .
the hoover dam tour only .
why am i paying extra for ruined memories .
. because i ' m addicted .
although be prepared to pay dearly for this drink .
i booked a round trip on spring break .
definitely not weight watchers friendly .
the perfect amount of food and a great value .
update : i went back !
"great food , great server , dana ."
everyone next ordered crepes for dinner .
i think i found a new favorite hangout spot !
"at other times , it was silent ."
it was so yummy .
the place is tiny but the food is delicious .
he took our order at the same time .
' ' or takeout orders at the counter .
this cheese store was delightful !
very curry in flavor .
we will definitely keep coming back !
. but nope i kept on dancing !
everything was very very fresh .
support your local bookstore !
maybe not enough herbs or cream ?
my sea bass was perfectly cooked !
so good in fact that i had two !
probably would n't go back .
kinda over priced for what we got .
"` ` hello , <UNK> ."
would def go back !
our food came out and was actually tasty .
more like a ton of disappointment .
the sides were 00-00 $ a piece .
the trout was yummy .
"i am very , very disappointed in their services ."
there was no price shown for these additional items .
the taste of the food was off .
too expensive and had cold unseasoned pull pork .
we do n't have dr . pepper !
a beautiful view and great food !
totally recommend ! ! love this place .
seared tuna steak - extremely beautiful plating .
thumbs up to them on that !
not just some tiny slices !
its almost too packed .
our room was large and spotless .
super fast and professional .
just not a pleasant experience .
service in the office was a bit slow .
we also got a small plate of twisted oysters .
i think taylor ' s cafe is just fine .
in a nice way .
he brought out 0 humongous tasty treats .
definitely worth a stop !
we will continue to support local business over chain .
i love me a savoury crepe .
i went with my husband and another couple .
their patio is awesome .
melt in your mouth .
soup was just barely lukewarm & way over salted .
the decor is simply beautiful .
"in fact , their prices were most competitive ."
the room as absolutely beautiful .
i wish i could eat them more often !
"good sound system , zippy and convenient ."
sea food was over cooked mussels and shrimp .
these items alone are primo .
. taking sake shots while telling you the menu .
they were n't bad ribs .
he ' d probably like bigger portions .
everything is always on point every visit !
super swanky and very chill .
a nice choice of restaurants to meet every budget .
candles lit and dim lighting .
the chocolates for their <UNK> service were good .
we will be going back !
it was ridiculously slow .
"overall , we liked the wine warehouse ."
the garlic knots were actual heaven on earth .
"it is a spacious cafe , nothing special though ."
<UNK> ! ! ! ask your server for suggestions .
the spicy tuna roll was okay .
just that it was n't for me that day .
"charcuterie plates , hamburgers , and grilled cheese ?"
- rrb - food : loved the oysters .
"even though , it was still a delightful sandwich ."
staff is always friendly but on the slow side .
we did n't even pay with her .
they were very polite and professional .
of course i never got a call back .
"vegas , the hotel is just for sleeping ."
overall it ' s okay .
my mom however loved her meal at <UNK> .
the brisket is yummy .
this was my second time here .
"yes , there are bad seats in this place !"
$ 0.00 for a glass of wine !
. and not part of my healthy lifestyle but .
my favorite is the strawberry carpaccio .
my room was very comfortable and clean .
our entrees were delish too !
they have a veggie soup that was really good .
give ' em a try !
thanks so much chris and david !
we wish there was one in seattle ! ! !
did i already say that ?
try waiting an hour and 0/0 .
great for mother ' s day or <UNK> event .
"he is very polite , accommodating and professional ."
"well , sort of ."
"always busy , but always good ."
she made sure we wanted for nothing .
i loved this show !
... or maybe do n't .
never had a problem with anyone in my view .
everything is ã la carte .
always freshly made and very yummy .
overpriced in my opinion .
barbie is my favorite .
justin was so much fun !
"it was ok , but nothing super spectacular ."
but he looked homeless .
thankfully <UNK> and <UNK> is not like that .
my favorite store in the scottsdale fashion square mall .
i hate eating in a winter coat .
i would highly recommend !
0 stars for outrageous prices .
you can guarantee a fun night here !
we ' ll be back !
the only thing they change often is dessert .
no room to do anything really .
"really , really , just yikes ."
i ordered my drink and some treats .
we want to smell the good food !
it reminded me of my grandma ' s .
best $ 00 i spent in vegas .
most unprofessional service i ' ve ever gotten .
"oh , it did ."
the parking is horrific .
"chicken enchilada lunch special , green style ."
the waitress was adamant about the cut off too .
nothing beats home cooked filipino food for me .
she never cried once !
"simple ingredients , amazing flavor ."
an overall nice experience .
what a walk down memory lane !
i love their salad bar .
the food is okay .
would n't call it memorable .
it was truly lovely .
"definitely worth trying , enjoy !"
scrumptious and <UNK> olive oil .
that was two hours after we went up front .
we bought the waterfall serenity package with no regrets .
delicious japanese food and crazy fast service .
xs is my favorite club in vegas .
. i have switched to dr . campbell .
always fresh and tasty .
"however , today change my perspective towards this place ."
it was perfect for prom .
such a good combination !
cover was $ 0 which included a raffle ticket .
the inside of the restaurant is beautiful .
the menu is delicious .
the rush tower king room was huge !
that definitely did not happen .
made my sandwich completely wrong and super sloppy .
"well , that never happened !"
the wrap was great !
it ' s vegas so that ' s expected !
and jay gave us a magazine !
. just adding a little kick to it .
from gas to food to clothes !
the fondue thing was cute .
i did n't bother and found a dunkin donuts .
i get home starving and ready to eat .
"service was attentive , but a bit rushed ."
mimosas are always good and staff is friendly .
do not go here .
shout out to the company !
he knows his stuff .
will definitely come back .
they knew they had me .
wonderful chunks of cheese .
the dip was better .
they always take care of the ladies .
<UNK> is a fantastic experience for friends and families .
he was the guy who filled our water cups .
"unfortunately , that did not happen ."
the neighborhood is a little scary though .
i love this place !
i love this place !
so we left and took our business elsewhere .
the chocolate surprise tiramisu sounds good .
we crave it almost nightly !
will not be back .
my one thought for newbies .
the tortas are the best .
way better customer service .
they have donuts there !
o . m . g . everything is amazing .
i ' ll definitely be back !
they have matinee shows and some evenings .
he then turned around and walked away .
will totally be disappointed !
i thought revolution was just ok .
is all i have to say .
we got 0 boards and 0 wines .
i ' ve had better for less .
love the food and the owner !
they were quick and attentive once inside .
my plate fed 0 well .
"the decor is great , the waitstaff is nice ."
the best thing about this restaurant are the employees .
and a nice one at that .
this visit was way off mark .
i got the veggie burger and potato salad .
i got my dad hooked on them .
the desserts were okay .
service was slow and music is loud .
"we got the super 0 sicilian style , small ."
felt like i was part of a festival !
i am so glad i found this studio !
i also really like the owners .
; 0 - rrb - very mediocre .
perfect for a romantic stay .
they were all fresh and so yummy .
most definitely will come back !
on a rare occasion i have a <UNK> .
they were very good !
the service was okay .
we all love to have cable right !
they always have a soup of the day .
$ 00.00 for resort fee .
it ' s thoroughly entertaining and is visually beautiful .
plus free hot chocolate !
the salmon and tuna tacos were great !
"instead , he seemed annoyed ."
. right next to campus !
will definitely be back to try again .
"i just tried their excellent cheesy , jalapeno bread ."
or maybe we should have ordered something else .
our waitress was really nice .
i love the fireside lounge .
i did n't want to ever leave .
i had really high hopes for this place !
worth is for me !
the atmosphere is great and the waiters are friendly .
"montreal , you have so much of this ."
we will be back here next trip !
"service was good , staff was friendly ."
the service : hit and miss .
there are a few customers who cause trouble .
what an unexpectedly pleasant experience this was .
"greated at the door , very friendly ."
my boyfriend ordered the rabbit dish .
it was so tender and full of flavor !
had the mac and cheese .
i chose chateau saint jean chardonnay .
they both enjoyed their meal .
i guarantee hong ' s wo n't disappoint !
keep it goin guys !
very pricy but worth it !
they are really amazing .
definitely my kind of place !
the smoke was very bothersome and <UNK> my asthma .
"i emailed them on facebook , no response ."
~ ~ ~ it was pretty good .
i love dr . boyd .
i felt like it was going to take forever .
and the atmosphere was wonderful .
the egg roll was ok .
"my friend went with her fave , blue moon ."
the chicken sandwich was pretty disgusting .
she was nowhere to be found .
i will definitely come back over and over again .
"small , quaint , great cocktails ."
we will back to try the brunch in august .
we will definitely do that again !
it was all synchronized too !
it literally was just okay .
i had their omelet bar w / cheesy potatoes !
the waiters are always soft spoken and very friendly .
i liked it more than the vindaloo .
the groupon was a bust .
this is a nice hidden gem in las vegas !
"and finally , the rice is all <UNK> together ."
i really like their kimchi !
very friendly and polite .
now we know why .
- rrb - both were heavenly .
our hopes were shattered .
the <UNK> chocolate is perfect in flavor and consistency !
encore beach was my best pool experience yet .
it is also free to enter the park .
the rooms are beautiful & pretty spacious .
the fresh oj is <UNK> !
the oysters were delicious given the ponzu siracha toppings .
but seriously eat here !
i order the duck with lavender risotto .
i repeat - we were the only people there .
so professional and knows how to wow the guests .
i was too careless to <UNK> .
"overall , i will not return ."
i am very picky about my manicures and pedicures .
i love the remodel !
there are definitely regulars here that notice new faces .
lol today was a nice day in target .
wish we had one in cali !
i have never had a bad experience .
they were not busy .
"yes , i was a <UNK> !"
$ 00 and it was delicious .
i brought those items back .
i had a volcano roll and love affair roll .
the chicken piccata was delicious .
the pizza is equally good !
"so , i ' m conflicted ."
love love this place .
fast and easy service .
makes no sense to me .
i had a great experience at <UNK> ' s .
"plus , people are friendly and service is quick ."
really good service this evening and they were busy .
very few things for me is .
. burger was <UNK> but not worth it .
. but it ' s so appropriate !
the food was great .
he truly cares about taking care of his customers .
the rest of the experience was fine .
they were great to share though .
i had no problem .
"also , lots of great accessories ."
did n't find the perfect piece today .
they wanted to charge me .
i am glad i did .
i ' m sure the meal will please you .
so we ordered a chicken fried rice .
- rrb - while i was gone .
smoke does not mean dry .
justin <UNK> is amazing !
loved everything about this hotel .
pure genius in that combination .
for dessert we split the carrot cake .
he responded with ` ` no !
the people that work there are friendly and nice .
so good of course .
i was not impressed .
everything i told <UNK> happened !
the total came out to $ 0 .

plantains and dipping sauces .

"however , the forum shops still hold up ."
paying $ 000 + a night is ridiculous .
the performances were very loud .
i ' m not even vegan / vegetarian .
my hubby <UNK> a meaty pizza average he said .
professional and easy to work with .
they also have veggie burgers .
not much vegan indian food around !
hubby had a classic american cheese on texas toast .
would highly recommend to everyone .
and it ' s wonderful .
the best food and service !
the poppy seed dressing is refreshing .
the bathroom was small and old .
do you walk out ?
"wish i could them better , but not impressed ."

i love coming here so much .
<UNK> fried rice a 0rd must have for me .
a cheap and effective car wash .
"very nice service , beautiful restaurant ."

honestly i was so disappointed .
that alone warrants an extra star .
great food and i would recommend it !
it was n't a big deal for me though .
nice feature i ' d say .
i think it was a bit overpriced .
the bread is the best in vegas .
foodies never ever lie about food .
they did n't even offer tea .
it is sweater weather after all .
". hint , hint ."
the salad is on-point .
my boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed his scrambled eggs special .
i also enjoyed the salted caramel expresso i got .
the shrimp tacos was also a small portion .
i enjoy coming here .
if ya ' ll are from so .
they have a mixture of chinese and thai food .
this one is quite bigger and more alive .
do not even step foot in here !
they went above and beyond my expectations .
he is short with guests and very condescending .
it ' s pretty ridiculous .
bring your own snack and drinks !
there is no human level before business level here .
<UNK> <UNK> is my favorite stylist .
the miso black cod literally melted in my mouth .
food was good ... service was just ok .
i was expecting at least a 00 min wait .
i had the veggie burger which was okay .
"believe me , i do ."
this was never mentioned .
we will definitely be back !
i really thought this was an awesome hotel .
it is for sure i will not go back .
"' ' ` ` <UNK> , yes ."
i have to say the bands were great !
"this place is fast , and easily customizable ."

we always liked red robin burgers .
the crab cake burger was soft and perfectly seasoned .
drinks - probably the best part .

"we called the manager , was n't super helpful ."
sushi is n't bad .
it makes sense but was not clear .

threading is so much better than a wax !
they are always friendly .
everyone else wanted sushi and i could n't argue .
service was great but the food was awful .
"no , but there are literally a million options ."
it was so quite during weekday afternoon .
my mouth is literally watering just thinking about it !
we love taking new people to try it .

the food is amazing !
you ca n't go wrong here !
the <UNK> bread took us directly to carb heaven .
i ordered the italian cheese pizza .
obviously i did not continue with this company .
it was a very wonderful and savory breakfast .
the chicken was super dry and tasteless .

00.00 for 0 people .
the hostesses were really rude .
such a large selection of beautiful fruits and veggies .

$ 0.00 is worth losing loyal customers ?
it was all bubbly and looked awful .
wish i could give zero stars .
that order is huge !
' ' just super dry and very unwelcoming .
the decor is very appealing as well .
this place gets <UNK> and double <UNK> .
i said does it come with anything ?

another topping was an egg .
the prices are decent comparatively .
maybe it ' s the long hours ?
loved the coffee cups !
i would highly recommend this place !

pear and bleu cheese .
they even walk on you .
i probably should have stuck with pizza .
this place is the best .

i feel like i ' m in a club .
they have <UNK> to pay on .
horrible experience other than the one nurse .
in so glad i called brandon !
i would never recommend it to a free .
however the setting was over the top .
with that being said ... happy eating !
we were relieved until we saw the prices !
definitely will go back !
the menu offers great options for any occasion .
she chose the restaurant .
busy in the good way .
i would have to say the food was ok .

i ' d definitely go back !
"requested a refund which sandy , agreed ."
the waitress smelled of alcohol .

while i drank my coffee flavored beer .
ceiling to floor windows .

twenty 0 is great for happy hour .
"however , the appetizers were ok ... nothing exciting ."
everyone is always helpful and always smiling !
on a friday night in a bar ?

"thank you , thank you , thank you ."
i love dive bars .
we will definitely go back .
next time i will probably try the fried catfish !
the restaurant itself is small but very cozy .

it ' s all down to taste !
it was covered with toppings .
my new favorite bar !

it ' s pretty much my go-to grocery stop .
food came out quite fast !
it was our first time here .
they deliver if you are purchasing a large item .
i love all the vegetarian options and ingredients .
bad customer relations and for $ 00 ?
our host and server were personable and detailed oriented .

which were both packed .
i ' ve never felt rushed .
had around 0-0 documents .

awesome happy hour with great apps and drinks .
i laughed so hard it was n't even funny .
the squid was n't rubbery .
the guys behind the piano were n't the best .
i had to ask what the meat was .

"my pictures came out blurry , out of focus ."
but there is still some growing room for sure .
will not go back .
my friend and i ate here this week .
inexpensive and delicious ! ! enough said .
delicious food and good service !
a girl needs some variety in her food options !
this is not authentic indian food by any means .

"but to my surprise , it was the special !"
it was about 0:00 pm .
it is ideal in every way .

kind of a staple for my hangovers in vegas .

awesome bootcamp and booty blast class too .
it ' s served over a crushed chickpea mixture .
real caramel sauce ! ? yes please .
"breakfast pastries , danishes and croissants oh my !"
"just be quiet and exchange it , please ."
the house wine was also a let down .
definitely a chill spot inside the cosmopolitan .

very flavorful and convenient .
above and beyond nice !
it featured egg plant in a tomato sauce .
the food in so fresh and healthy !

first time going to sushi 00 .
"lots of essential oils , candles and beautiful jewelry !"
we enjoyed a couple rounds of very tasty margaritas .
very organized and clean .
the service continued to be wonderful .
. i was nervous .
i guess since it takes longer to cook chicken .
would have been smart to put a sign up .
place looked busy and smelled delightful .
only problem with this place is their guac .
i have no idea how people avoid getting dinged .
would not go there again .
they brought the incorrect sandwich to my niece .
gross do not stay there
really tasty sandwiches and queso !
overall this was a great experience !
"also , they have multiple vegetarian options ."
that is n't nearly enough .
walked in and sat down last night .
i wo n't be back .
we will definitely return .
the prices were ridiculous .
it was very awkward .
tacos were expensive and tasted bad .
i immediately fell in love with the kalua pig .
come early when it ' s empty !
this place is great !
$ 00 for a carnita plate !
also the homemade tofu is so silky and tasty .
"the server was intelligent , friendly and very knowledgeable ."
i look forward to coming back for my purchases !
' ' i was shocked !
this is a ` ` green ' ' store .
it tasted like nothing .
tried the full montagu and it was incredibly delicious !
finally the 0rd night we were moved .
i highly recommend it !
i really enjoyed my recent stay at the mirage .
it ' s definately <UNK> as previously stated .
i loved the fire and chandeliers setting .

salsa and chips were good !
after the rude hostess and mediocre drinks we left .
went on a saturday night !

the food was delicious .
here ' s the truth people .
it did n't feel like a hotel at all .

salmon tartar with seaweed is very good .
the customer service is awesome .
"the room was spacious , clean and classic decor ."
he looked very presentable .

i also discovered their new fresh strawberry mango cooler .
did n't seem fresh .
the <UNK> won the game !
"a coffeehouse with beer , i love it already ."
was n't keen on the wine list .
they wait until the last fan has their prize .
to begin with they brought us bread .
my friend had the chicken avocado .
"also , it takes forever to get your server ."
that irks me to no end .
food wise we got way too much .
we definitely will be back .
me and a group of friend went there .
the food and wine was amazing .
i will go back just for the baked goods .
now i realize that everyone deserves a vacation .
the restrooms are clean though .
the presentation was really cute .
then she disappears a second time ... .
atmosphere is n't elegant but it is n't awful .
and so we did .
never again will i step foot at <UNK> grille .
all the salads were fresh .
this is much much more .
the selection is devine .
we even went back the following day .
we also tried their chicken fingers which were alright .
"oh yes , be sure to go out back !"
that person was miguel .
duck fat fries are just delish .
the <UNK> was cozy and quaint .
ordering online is convenient and they deliver fast .
just the broth had so much flavor .
only select beers and wines .
our server appeared as though she did not care .
making for a great saturday night .
0 star is more than they deserve .
they are famous for their german pancakes too .
the food is fresh and the breakfast dishes innovative .
there were multiple complaints .
everything is <UNK> everywhere with no rhythm or reason .
a hidden treasure in las vegas !
they have competition with <UNK> ' s !
it was love at first bite .
maybe they have the better selections outside of brunch .
", and still provide the same great food !"
i do n't even know where to start .
- the <UNK> mojitos are delish !
two words : homemade oreos .
i will never come to this <UNK> again .
hence the 0 stars .
he knows his stuff and keeps it fun .
it ' s a very romantic atmosphere .
the servers are all friendly and provided excellent service .
would come back here .
"why , yes please !"
the <UNK> was fresh and cooked to order .
specifically their infamous creme brulee ... soooo sooo yummy !

i thought the food was great !
the service is fast and efficient .
"our first time here , and it was awesome !"

` ` complimentary ride back ' ' ya right .
the only downside is the prices are pretty steep .
i waited and waited .
the lunch specials are big portions !
the service was impeccable .
they were amazing and delicious .
i was in absolute heaven .
do n't sleep on the blueberry crepes either !
00 minutes was 0 hour .
the first thing we did was order some drinks .
gather your friends and split a lane .
i can always find what i want here .
the dish itself made me really full .
. and i ' m a fairly light sleeper .
i thought that was fair .
and by the way where is the doctor ?
the avocado dressing is amazingly flavorful .
she was very distant and absent the whole meal .
she just thought it sounded good .
"' ' ` ` uh , nevermind then ."
this is the perfect place for breakfast and lunch .
there was nothing spectacular about the burger whatsoever .
what a stunning view of the belagio at night !
i do n't know what they were called .
good food for a good price !
"anyway , our waitress was decent ."
the value for the charge was well worth it !
we will absolutely be back .

we live in the neighborhood .
this stadium is seriously so awesome though !
the taro smoothie is wonderful .
i wished we had sat outside .
i had the <UNK> omelette and it was delicious .

. i decided not to eat it !
* sugar snap peas - good and extremely fresh .
it ' s a pretty good size too .
"great ambiance , pizza , salad & wine !"
i actually think i prefer pf changs .
i prefer target of <UNK> .
but i do love the food !
the <UNK> and flank steak were both great .
that croissant / delicious egg combo was awesome .
food was quite wonderful .
best sushi in phoenix hands down .
the enchiladas were lackluster but i ate them anyways .
but went for the nostalgia factor .
that was a fun looking dish !
how can you not love healthy amazing food !
their bakery items are great and not that expensive .
nothing so horrible that you ' d storm out .
it was exactly like the description .
great work on my son ' s iphone .
staff was friendly and fun .
the bar staff is rude and hardly recognize you .
"yeah , i was hungry !"
"great atmosphere , super service and excellent food !"
our waiter was prompt and very nice .
"i love the cluttered , <UNK> decor ."
the only <UNK> was the bread .
we stay in a lot of hotels .
"the staff was pretty great , too ."
behind that large pool is ` ` bare .
i ' ve definitely had better .
i am truly disappointed .
we were only allowed to go into 0 .
i will not use this location ever again .
"' ' no , not in the greenhouse ."
well worth the $ 0 for chips & salsa .
this place has delicious pizza and greek salad !
"will definitely go back , super atmosphere !"
the asian in me kept looking for dipping sauce .
i loved the cheesy bread that they brought out .
there is a manager walking around <UNK> .

i was not disappointed .
all of the above !
i really appreciated the portions as well .
i do n't understand why .
let me say this ... definitely worth the hype .
and wine and beer !
i am so torn with this place .
fresh fish and beautiful presentation .
i almost always go around lunch time .
everything that i ' ve had is good .
i would stay here again i love fremont !
it ' s pretty amazing .
it was so light and refreshing .
dr . <UNK> is amazing .
"i do n't just throw that around , either ."
this particular location is n't my favorite .

prices are under $ 00 and portions are generous .
i would definitely recommend .
the food was good .
the food is great & happy hour is cheap !
ps they fix water damage
staff is always friendly and knowledgeable .
i could n't stop eating .

i wanted something to <UNK> that calorie <UNK> .
entertainment is always a pleasure !
everything is very well organized for all involved .
customer service was great and the food was delicious .
the sound during alice cooper was horrible .

this was an awesome event .
a biscuit came with it .
there was so much hype over white castle .
definitely recommend this place !
everything is so fresh !
it was just less than okay .
overflowing of fresh pulled turkey and lots of avocado !
good luck my friend !
the ladies here were amazing !
their hh drinks are good though !
. y do you care ... ?
such a great environment & <UNK> ' s coffee !
i am a naturally graceful and beautiful figure <UNK> .
probably wo n't return .

the store alone is awesome !
i ' ve never been disappointed .
start your buffet of buffets around 0-0 .
you get a plain waffle or plain omlet .
the staff are very nice and helpful .
like i said i really like this place .
pretty lame all around .
almost like a chimichurri .
i love wide rice noodles like that .
"the atmosphere was nice , romantic and cozy ."
staff was attentive and very helpful .
"love , love this place ."
yesterday was $ 00 .
my new favorite party pool !
even the rice and beans were bland !
rice was flavorful with saffron butter in it .
my friend got the same but without the jelly .
we had a great view !
service was also great !
spring rolls were ok .
"so overall , it was still a good show !"
served with lil grilled toasts .
drinks only ! ! another great thai place !
the <UNK> beans were the only thing halfway tasty !
"he is very thorough , gentle and patient ."
do you want fresh ?
cant get better than that !
we try out the sushi rolls too .
they had no idea how long it would be .
we had an awesome time .
salmon over very creamy risotto and <UNK> .
thai plates was fantastic !
i ' m in love with woodman ' s .
i love perfect scoop for their ice cream .
they are served in double shot type of glasses .
but really ... those crispy noodles though ... yum .
amazing different fusion food !
"they make the donuts fresh , so be patient ."
i thought that was top notch service .
my advice is to share !
but definitely not for dinner .
inside it is clean and smells like tea .
will refer anyone i know to go here .
they have a decent happy hour menu .
the blue martini had a glow stick in it .
it was very strong and sweet .
wish this place were closer to home .
feeling we are back on the island ?
well it did n't .
convenient location to my house .
best cupcakes in montreal .
i got 00 % off for my next visit .
we decided to come here for the first time .
our waiter was disinterested at best .
the club was intimate .
thus the - 0 star !
mighty tasty i have to say .
the bad : - nothing !
it was so disappointing ... .
amazing with arugula and parmesan .
the service was excellent !
the entree was the perfect size portion as well .
we paid and left .
we received all 0 in 0 minutes !
they have so many flavors to choose from !
i ordered the tacos <UNK> .
"overall , worth the time and money ."
reminds me of a combination of <UNK> ?
. but seriously they pretty much have everything .
. she yelled out calling a different person .
and the crust was nasty and doughy .
i really love frozen yogurt .
they have new jewelry every time i go in !
it is a small and cozy restaurant / bar .
. which is always a plus in my book .
we both loved it !
"the second time , we had the tasting menu ."
the bacon was delicious .
i had the strawberry white cake seasonal .
i felt very <UNK> and happy i came here .
the special of the evening was corn fritters .
chandler glass pulled through beautifully .
my only regret : not getting the mimosa sampler !
the staff was also very friendly and accommodating .
the comfy bed would make it totally worth it .
especially on my anniversary .
i liked the mini burrito options to try favorites .
"i like rosemary , but it tasted almost bitter ."
i thought the customer service had really gone down .
guys paid $ 00 ?
. it ' s just very disappointing .
as we were finishing our server brought the check .
personally i would like it without the coating .
we will be back .
the hotel itself is very small .
so ... moist ... oh my .
afraid to go to the others around here .
the liberty fondue was okay .
they are very honest and reliable .
place is very clean we will definitely be back .
my server was not doing her job at all .
the soup is full of flavor .
our bill came to about $ 00.00 before tip .
"no answer , went to voicemail ."
got us into surrender at encore to see <UNK> !
cant wait to go this year !
service is so bad .
sarah does such a great job every time .
my mouth is watering just thinking about them .
. ! ! i was very sadly disappointed .
management needs more training they lack in customer service .
personally i think this is a great family outing .
all in all boring .
it will be worth it for sure .
many other parties were seated before us .
we were n't disappointed .
"we were the only ones there , though ."
we will not be back .
room overlooked pool and the patio for culinary dropout .
even have misters for outside seating .
that alone should say enough .
wo n't be coming back .
went in around 0am on a friday night .
please trust me on this one .

it ' s just a few store fronts away .
there were so many things going on at once !

"vivian , the waitress , comes over ."
this took about 0 minutes .
the pasta ... was even worse .

i like the room we had this time .
that ended up being <UNK> .
the food came out quickly after we ordered .
"for my entree , i got the eggplant parmesan ."
but we felt they we ' re pricey .
she is very experienced and knowledgeable .
those are yummy dipped in any kind of sauce .
had the sprinkle chocolate and cinnamon bun glazed .
"` ` vegas , baby , vegas !"
"you ' ll be happy , trust me ."
there are tvs everywhere ; good for watching games .
all three dishes were beyond amazing .
"a bit dry , frozen , cold or tasteless ."
the mini bar was fully stocked .
- rrb - the crust tasted stale and burnt .
we felt very welcomed .
"finally , we make our way inside ."
"she got the salmon , and it looked wonderful ."
the bread is great by itself as well .
this one has gelato !
great value for the money .
but this time something was off .
"funny enough , my second favorite is plain cheese !"
everything was so so so so good .
he likes to add tomato and extra cheese .
"upon arrival , it was very cute ."
egg was perfectly poached .
as the dough was very soft .
this location has hours until 0pm .
the fresh kiwi watermelon lemonade was delicious !
on it she was charging me the add-on price !
on thursdays they have quiz nights with cash prizes .
dr . patel is so professional and caring .
"first off , the service was awful ."
pros : everyone loves a local deli !
for the price we expected a little more .

i was there yesterday - twice .
here is a rundown of our night : 0 .
the entertainment was great .
our waiter was nice .
oh how i love this place .
it ' s a taco meets grilled cheese sandwich .

"the food are delicious , proportioned and well priced ."
we love this place .

i love them all .
my favorite cocktail - the cucumber martini - yummy !

it ' s a nice little airport .
she is just awesome .
perfectly seasoned and tender !
i now have <UNK> love for crepes !
most of the food was good .
the service was horrible .
the cookie crumb crust was delightful !
but the great salsa helped a lot !
definitely got two full scoops in my small dish .
"in a good way , of course ."
swings are close to pad and playground is covered .
the chicken was tender and flavorful .
i highly recommend it .

it definitely keeps me coming back .
i am definitely bringing my dog here again !
i literally drank both sauces !
it was a unique meal for sure .
"holy tastiness , batman !"
"- shrimp ceviche , yes ."
the atmosphere is great and the staff is friendly .
instead she just walked off .
"straight up , the food is <UNK> delicious ."
maybe not so worth it .
the dã © cor is so bright and clean .
definitely will be back !
"overall , i could n't find a flaw ."
the sangria is dangerous !
the desserts are especially worthy of mention .
unprofessional and really poor management .
the elk ribs and the octopus were less perfect .
do n't find many places like this one !
thank you for everything !
"i love , love , love <UNK> ."
i would n't say it was dripping in flavor .
they said it was turkey .
call ahead to see if they are busy .
"clean , comfortable and professional ."
"it was kind of flavorless , unfortunately ."
i splurged and went for dessert as well .
we did n't explore too much .
great prices for great food and good hearty portions .
did not have a positive experience .
what a waste of 0â 0/0 hours
would not come back .
"props to the chef , because the passion shows ."
i went to las vegas on halloween weekend .
i could n't be happier with the quality .
fish was fresh and delicious !
the service was awesome ... very attentive and prompt .
i am <UNK> a bloody mary snob .

"dang it , i want that now !"

i felt really comfortable here .
"thank you for taking us here , david !"

nice employees and a drive-thru to boot !
but i was n't .
i love dr . <UNK> !
nice not too battery filled with seafood !

kids ordered mac n cheese and shepard pie .
the veggie platter entree is alway amazing too .
very important to us .
i really enjoyed by lasagna .
pizza : what the heck happened to their crust ?

wonderful family owned place .
they are also accommodating for large parties .
the staff is very friendly and helpful .

"well priced , and so nice and friendly !"
absolutely love this location .
figured maybe it was just an off night .
the food and service was perfect .
the pool side food was n't too shabby either .
finally we had dessert .
maybe i was too sober .
the <UNK> had a cinnamon ?
the bartenders were very accommodating as were the hostesses .
high end glassware and place settings .
"well , i did ."
i ' m not sure .
the spicy sweet shrimp is also to-die-for .
we will be back !
their <UNK> are amazing and of course ... .
it ' s worth it .
his burger was not cooked correctly and tasted lackluster .
they have a great selection of seafood and meat .
a decision i regretted .
beautiful views of the <UNK> talon golf course !

attended a small reception in a suite there .
the owner vanessa was amazing .
' ' i likes me some spicy .
dr . sarah <UNK> is awesome !
the flavors were very mild .
select a different ` ` luxury ' ' bag .
hopefully it was a fluke and not standard practice !

i ca n't remember if i had anything else .
"the food was not good , in my opinion ."
my mouth and tummy was a happy camper .
would ' ve been overkill .
how can so much food bear so little taste ?
i have stayed at this westin twice .
she was the perfect waitress .
- lrb - that ' s a good thing !
the menu is wayyyy too long .
the burger was alright - just alright .
he was great with his co-workers .
"the restaurant is small , but cozy ."
but i was excited and did n't care .
maybe they thought i would n't notice .
we had the chilling chicken and garlic naan .

these ladies are amazing !
i love this store : - - rrb -
this place has it all !
oh and do n't skip dessert .

i would n't order those again .
"crisp and refreshing , but once again no excitement ."
"over good , but not great"
` ` so what about cleanliness ?
i love their cozy interior .
i can not go here without getting it .
clean and roomy serving traditional filipino food .
we grabbed dinner here our first night in vegas .

love local bakeries and this one is superb !
stinky ' s is magical .
loved the idea of a complimentary soup to start .
the massage felt marvelous .
i am a known positive yelper .

venetian is definitely not the hotel for us .
my favourite is the pork kimchee dumplings .
i love this place .
"and , apparently , delivery ."
i was totally taken a back .
baked potato was a baked potato .
"popeyes is further away , but much tastier ."

' ' met friends for drinks and dinner .
their food is pretty good .
are n't all express stores the same ?
but i still head over to books first .
i needed them for work .
"also , the hotels restaurants were great ."
wish we had more places like this in toronto !
rice is bland with a side of funk !
great gift packages too .

order extra thai tea .
everything we tried including the italian wines were perfect .
made reservations for brunch on a thursday morning .

it was very delicious .
i am disappointed with my visit .
my friend had an unmemorable pasta dish .
. how can an employee yell at customers ?
i have been to the peppermill several times .
how can i not return on a regular basis ?
the menu has plenty of choices for everyone .
i will never stay at this establishment .
our actual server was a unfriendly dud .
too bad she ca n't work there all year .
the staff is very friendly !
did i say yum ?
"the coaches are extremely knowledgeable , friendly and patient ."
ca n't find hummus that tastes like this !
the chicken and waffles here was big and good !
the place is a meat market .
we were so thrilled to have found this place .
* * * bathroom and bathtub were <UNK> .
i had the eggplant parm .
i absolutely recommend <UNK> dental .
we gave our beverage and food order .
i had to remind her for it .
it is all less than mediocre .
"amazing show , with too much to see ."
loved the homemade <UNK> .
discovered this little gem while out and about .
it was visually appealing .
he was already planning a repeat visit .
so disappointing and i expected much more .
the rest of the burger was also not seasoned .
and it lacked lots of seasoning and color !
hope sls makes it !
we will go back again !
more shops to open ?
our meals were served on actual <UNK> plates .
one of them even rolled her eyes .
she ' s 00 by the way ... .
it is connected to cafe <UNK> .
we also ordered room service .
"however , the fish is not always fresh ."
the show was also very <UNK> <UNK> .

i appreciate all of those things .
marcus has what it takes to be a manager .
i ' m happy to grant him that wish .
loved the green salsa on the asada .
the gift shop was amazing .
we order pizza here a lot !
this is the perfect date restaurant .
the green salsa was nice and spicy .
"it was good , greasy ."
try it and you will like it !
they are cooked well but ours were too salty .
then we were off to king putt .
the turkey sandwich was the main crime .
it has a super calming feel to it .
it ' s worth the try .
i can get better chinese take out in arizona .
the prices were reasonable .
i love fries with the skin still there .
we enjoyed the evening outside by the fire pit .
well where do i begin .
"all in all , go see shows here !"
"nice , quiet ambience ."
i ' m still waiting for that call .
there is quality here too .
most of them are great !
: - rrb - which makes mine !
what a great store .
the floor needs a good mopping and waxing .
it was filled with lobster chunks - really yummy !
i ate every bite .
chocolate souffle : amazing !
the plus is the deli area .
i really like this place i have to say .
this is one to remember .
the applesauce was ... interesting .
i ' m all about simplicity .
- rrb - was really good .
my favorite place to take my car .
i <UNK> my teeth and checked my bag .
the whole experience was just <UNK> .
that would be great if someone ever came around .
do not buy they ' re pre made pizza !
"we went this past saturday , march 00 ."
the pods you sit in were really nice .
not my favorite <UNK> location .
i always get the oriental salad with garlic chicken .
but it was delicious and surprisingly filling !
wow wow and wow again !
wish i had taken a picture of everyone .
he did not have any leftovers to take home .
i tried the spicy garlic and chipotle honey .
"nothing special about the salmon , though ."
even more <UNK> upset .
there is also a selection of juices and milk .
food was also really good !
i ' d definitely go back .
burgers were actually excellent .
i ' ve experienced nothing but friendly service .
thank you so much .
the food is really good .
my other friend order jumbo shrimp .
also cash only too .
looking forward to more !
i love this place !
the vegetables were cold .
he can work on my back anyday !
glad we got here when we did .
we were not going to buy anything else .
cute fire places and <UNK> hanging lights .
good place to sit outside and bring the pup .
i ended up getting a turkey cheeseburger .
no <UNK> as of today .
everyone left feeling full and happy with the meal .
"again , i declined ."
our meals were very enjoyable !
the short rib was fork tender and really wonderful .
we each got a bowl to ourselves .
i will never go back to them .
there was n't any real organization to it .
expect long lines but worth the wait .
i reluctantly chose p . .
more bang for your buck for sure .
"stick to their drinks , which look delicious ."
"playful , sweet , a faithful companion ."
do n't feel the need to go back .
do n't stay silent and awkward and avoid us !
the chicken was yummy .
everything was free of cost to us !
the bread pudding style french toast - wow .
they also have sandwiches and weekends have cronuts .
service was n't good and room were less then .
solid inexpensive thai place .
"for pizza , we got half the big apple ."
no pictures of anything on the walls .
i really enjoyed this sandwich .
the service was faster .
i wo n't be returning .
like their selling hip hop threads and not bbq .
i will definitely be back .
it is actually a cold salad type of dish .
"' ' eff you , bitch !"
"very clean , large bedrooms and bathrooms ."
it was everything we wanted !
this lost a star for m0 .
i never really liked it .
so i have found my new appliance repair company .
i do n't really care for the vibe .
the food is just okay .
i ' m a loyal customer !
even the atm machine is broken .
lots and lots of options !
it was refreshing with a little kick to it .
. we couldnt decide cuz everything sounded so tasty !
the service on our recent visit was <UNK> .
- rrb - and he was fantastic .
so i was extremely happy .
two stars only because the fries were decent .
i had the worst experience ever .
she pointed out the apps and what they were .
. perfect as always .
the maintenance staff is just perfect .
the oxtail was huge and tender .
"overall , inexpensive and great quality ."
their steak is sooo delicious .
not to be missed at all
everything tastes so fresh and so wonderful .
we ordered bellinis and they were perfect .
they have one salad i like .
it was just too much .
ca n't wait to go back .
hate : pop music was blaring over the speakers .
i know this place has lunch specials from 0-0 .
the chicken had no flavor .
i think our servers name was al . .
the asparagus was not good at all .
definitely worth the drive .
the workers are blah .
we placed our orders and waited for our cocktails .
nor do they have brown rice .
most amazing cocktails and bartenders .
the atmosphere is classy and looks beautiful at night .
i took two family members with me .
the meat was good .
this wait has nothing to do with the stars .
the thai tea was huge and delicious .
"after working all day , who wants to cook ?"
serve was good and everyone was friendly .
to me there was really no flavor to them .
our waiter was clearly seasoned .
i am totally open to try everything and anything .
they were <UNK> fast .
check groupon for deals !
our waitress was horrible !
keep up the good work gentleman !
it ' s somewhat like being in a nightmare .
the park itself is nice and pretty big .
it has new stores n great shops .
"the enchiladas were very flavorful , but very dry ."
we wanted a cheap place to spend a night .
"loud music was playing , but forgot what kind ."
i highly recommend this place .
it made us feel uncomfortable and in the way .
the pizza was just ok .
but its definitely not worth the money .
but keep the deuce for the tourists .
"- rrb - , this is it ."
you could definitely hear in there .
we came during lunch time .
ordered oysters which were very fresh .
first night i had a bath mat .
"yes , i realize i just said neat ."
to top it off we had some amazing margaritas .
just go to paris buffet .
i guess that ' s the standard .
the food is all locally sourced blah blah blah .
my first appointment went exceptionally well .
the other room was equally crowded and slightly claustrophobic .
. while i was standing there !
i have a secret .
the venetian is probably my favorite hotel so far .
what a piece of sh * t show .
we came in and were warmly greeted .
bottled water is offered for $ 0 .
waiter never asked how the food / everything was .
i was really impressed with the tuna .

the patio makes it worth it .
they did thru did n't have our reservations .

strong accents but that didnt stop me from ordering .
i love this place !

he has learned so much since he started .
what difference does it make ?
i highly recommend this company .
i liked the veggies in it though .
loved the 000 stage and the intimate theatre .
reasonable prices and great selections .
our bill $ 00.00 overpriced not worth it .
"overall , an overpriced and over-rated experience ."
this is a great place for a date !
we ' d definitely order everything we had again !
maybe their pasta is better !

cash only and yes they have an atm .
this happens every time !
i really liked that .
my guy says the burger is bomb .
the service was very very slow .
but hey looks are deceiving !
i also love their system .
we started with the ahi appetizer .
floor to ceiling curtains frame the windows .
good coffee and pastries .
the massage was lackluster and frustrating .
the patio was nice to sit out on .
"also , expect large portions at affordable prices ."
i know that sounds weird .

my husband and i look at eachother .
they go above and beyond .
i did n't care for the soup .

the new owners make a huge difference !
i do agree that the music is too loud !
i also ordered loco moco and it was <UNK> !
why just three stars ?
"really fantastic food , and so so cheap ."
neither was even offered .
so if you plan on gambling .

"but you know , it ' s an adventure ."
still a great old place to visit .
we came late to see nicky <UNK> spin .
i loved every bite of it .
i should have ordered two pizzas !
"food : finally , the main event ."
the orange sauce <UNK> was just kinda weird .
better than anything i could have imagined .
the manager would not even let me finish speaking .
that was my breaking point .
i finally got up and grabbed the waiter .
the food was delicious .
the model i saw was beyond perfect .
i probably would not order it again .
and boots and pants !
no wonder the rooms were so cheap .
lots of laughs and lots of fun !
i ' ve only ever gotten take our <UNK> .

"tiny , kinda dry , too expensive ."
i had to say hello first .
well i did immediately .
that to me is a great deal !
we ended up throwing the food away .
' ' type of intro .
stopped by sunday with hubby on a bike ride .
do n't get anything with rice in it today .
we obviously did n't .
the food was delicious and the selection was great !
had more chocolate than the red velvet .
not crisp like mcdonald ' s fries .
"overall , i was happy with the experience ."

yes i am slightly in love with this place .
"also , this spot is good for people watching ."
was i ever surprised and delighted .
would 000 % come back again .
the dr . never returned my call .

oh my goodness this place is awesome !
it was just perfection .
the pancakes are like little pillows !

"cozy , warm , inviting ."
yummy drinks for brunch and delicious pastry basket .

it almost could have been a meal .
called and asked for a taxi to the airport .
the one surprise for me is the malai kofta .
i think the portions here are ample !
. but it was n't .
tasted like not well-cooked !
this place is amazing !
it really barely squished a bit .
bad customer service = no service .
i do love surprises .
just the nicest server .

i absolutely love corner thai .
be prepared to wait .

the pita bread was my favorite .
this place is <UNK> !
we both felt sick that night .
"i got the iced green tea , yum !"
so a friend took me to breakfast here .
"all were good , but mango was the best ."
they got me out an hour before our show .

my family and i will definitely be back !
everything here looked crisp and new .
fries are n't always vegan .
my only gripe was the cost !
it was just okay .
the lemon chicken was waaay too lemony .
we were all bundled up in a ball line .
they come with a cayenne mayo - lrb - ?
this is the perfect place for a dinner date !
"and this year , they are in full remodel !"
i will not be going back to this location .
so that ' s the service .
this was one of my favorite parts that night .

additionally they began painting the hallways at 0:00 am .
<UNK> is the best waiter !
and the mashed potato ... mmm delicious !
we will definitely return .
quaint little diner hidden atop mt . washington .
the only downside to this place is the parking .

take it or leave it : take it .
you can not beat the price .
i love the fresh n easy roll .

always so much i want to buy !
it was a little warm inside the restaurant .
shopping - go widow shopping in the canal shops .
the service was okay .
their sweet and sour chicken is literally mush .
portion sizes are fairly generous .

avoid the fried fish and popcorn shrimp .
the app was amazing !
very oily and heavy .
better safe than sorry !
just had a mediocre crepe and raspberry cheesecake .
first sip and i had to spit it out .

my husband walked in and was greeted politely .
delivery showed up on time from what was estimated .

i was seriously disappointed with this theater .
brick walls with comfort food and friendly staff .

very unorganized when it comes to having you sat
but the sauce was even better .
i am in love with this place .

the food was amazing !
. they are always gossiping with one another .
' ' loaded question my friend .

the calamari was amazing .
this company is beyond awful .
but i wo n't be going back .
why is this person in sales / customers service ?
our server was very attentive and service was great .
the gumbo was alright .
this neighborhood needs something more casual .
we will not be going back there .
the house we rented had lots of space tho .
the return packaging came and we shipped it back .
food is always delicious and fresh .
there was no one in line behind me .
it comes with a pretty leaf design too !
tony was our driver and was absolutely wonderful .
this portion was definitely on the larger side .
loved the passionfruit bottomless mimosas for $ 0 extra !
"people went back for seconds , even thirds !"
"more money for them , i assume ."
they do n't tell you this when signing up .
everyone here lights up .
talk about feeling like a queen !
again they observe and help !
minus the standing in line the concert was awesome .
lots of stuff at the hotel too !
i will definitely be back .
the owner is so nice and friendly .
sweet potato fries with spicy mayo dip ?

and we only go once or twice a year .
the club is stunning .
wonderful experience at the mirage !
the coffee was so hot and yummy !
i really enjoyed it all .
i was over charged .
the dipped italian beef with peppers is so good !
lolo ' s was my last stop .
only 00 miles off the 00 ?
we ordered the cadillac fajitas for two of us .
". so really , no complaints there ."
i also love their grown up grilled cheese .
their prices are also reasonable .
. wait for it ... bungalow !
i love this place and have been multiple times .
i would recommend it because the food is fantastic !
"every bite was tender , juice and very flavorful ."
totally threw off the taste of the roll !
"if they did , this place would be perfect !"
and we were out the door at $ 00.00 .
the produce is always fresh .
not your conventional way of ordering .
what a great addition in uptown !
had lunch there with a friend .
they were very friendly - great service .
it ' s a bit much though .
i ' m a fan !
the onion rings were terrible .
i did enjoy the food very much .
they do lose a star for their lackluster menu .
". which reminds me , the service was great ."
they really need new staff .
"all in all , a nice experience ."
try the homemade popcorn for desert - love it !
my husband likes their ipas and <UNK> brew .
i miss <UNK> in chandler .
sauce bar was a bonus !
it was so delicious and perfectly seasoned / spiced .
my friend got the ass juice .
monta does n't even come close to matching <UNK> .
side bread consisted of a huge <UNK> gruyere .
i felt the need to update the restaurant .
we did n't have to compete for charging time !
or so for our check .
"overall , i was not happy ."
absolutely unique & tasty !
food terrible and bad service .
it was monday and happy hour lasted all night .
"overall , we would definitely stay here again ."
food was so-so but man was the coffee bad !
it ' s a perfect option for a vegetarian !
both employees love dogs and are very friendly !
the portion was big .
you are treated like you have the plague .
it is in the complex with the big lots !
"however , i have never experienced service like this ."
. estimated a time of 0-000 .
did i mention i love their tortillas ?
my absolute favorite sandwich out !
feels like i am chilling at home !
tonight i had the <UNK> salad topped with chicken .
we walked in at 0: 00 pm .
that was a plus .
other best thing are their boards and their <UNK> !
"mind you , it was n't very busy ."
"she is skilled , knowledgable and intuitive ."
i ' m just so grossed out right now .
we had to practically beg for soy sauce .
good vibes and great cuts .
we only went as far as appetizers .
they did n't show until almost 00am .
would definitely stay there again .
- pancakes should not be <UNK> messes .
best place to work out in madison !
the service was great too .
my friend seemed to enjoy her food .
i called back the desert inn branch .
"seriously , love the food !"
visited this place for the first time today .
: - rrb - this place was horrible !
all the employees were friendly and quick .

"this one , not so much ."
it gave hubby some time to ask firearm questions .
it is so good .
you will not leave hungry .
so many vegan things to choose from .

"despite that , i keep coming back !"
they do n't charge you extra for bbq sauce .
the food is awful .

the sweet potato fries were ... alright .
i love the saucer .
it was a fantastic learning experience !
a definite must have .
i would highly recommend this company to anyone .
ummm the hog burger was not memorable at all .
a fun night out !
"excited to try this , totally disappointed ."
the donuts were perfect for dessert !
i will not be back .
the quality of food is top a must do .
- rrb - this is not authentic japanese food .
packed with seafood and packed quite a punch !
but was now out about $ 000 <UNK> .
the portions were so large we had leftovers .
the donuts were oh m g good .
. a nice buff .
"sadly , they have changed the salad recipe ."

"my first impression , this spot is super squished ."
my honey liked the carne asada quesadilla .
i wo n't be going back .
stayed here for halloween weekend .
"whatever it was , it was kind of gross ."
our waiter came by and took our orders .
i agree that the neighborhood is a little gross .
they are always cooking up something creative and delicious !
. you had time to sober up between drinks .
definitely ca n't hear the people you are with .
<UNK> food and a friendly and hip environment .
"i really do trust , josh ."
not going back to that one again !
bring water and wear good shoes .
we never stay here for dinner .
we sang and danced the entire time .
"speaking of the waitress , she was wonderful ."
no complaints from me .
so glad we did .
her salad came with lettuce and chicken .
the ambiance is quite nice but bland .
it ' s an omelet .
i will never go back to this spa .
be come here twice & get rude service .
i ' m glad we went .
this is one of their best in my opinion .
"i do n't care , it ' s addictive ."
definitely will be back !
they cafe was only mediocre .
their take on eggs benedicts is divine .
he made my car look perfect again .
i think . 00 cents an ounce is resonable .
the food is so good !
i will be back .
i effing love <UNK> .
' ' we knew that .
we were all <UNK> with each bite .
i definitely will be back here .
"also , do n't skip dessert ."
fries were so bomb i cleaned my bowl dry !
it was like complete rubber .
"i called ph right away , filed a complaint ."
deeply disappointed with this practice and medical advice .
"so , the server had her hands quite full ."
i ' m not pleased with this location .
i obviously would never recommend this place .
"fast , fresh and low-key ."
i do n't think we will be back .
great music and vibes .
crab cannelloni with smoked cauliflower custard .
will use them again for sure !
potatoes again had no flavor .
mostly because of all the space .
but they stopped offering the local rates last year !
the food is delicious .
bagels are okay but nothing special .
omg how vile ... where to begin !
i was disappointed on this particular visit .
"apple pie , pumpkin seasonally ."
. i will being going back .
i felt like i was in a nyc taxi !
i could n't even finish my plate .
* gasp * instead of shuffling back and forth .
"good food , good cocktails but no happy hour !"
it ' s one of my regular sushi spots .
"i frequent <UNK> , banana republic , j crew ."
everyone raved about the food and wine .

i had the red sangria which was delicious .
"first off , the food arrived super fast !"

the food is also amazing !

i really really really liked the chicken gizzards .
it would be great for kids !
my favorite place to eat in vegas !

but the service sucks .
so we ended up sitting outside .
"got there , we seated ourselves ."
every time we order from here something is wrong .
my sister ordered a full meal with wine .
"there are turtle <UNK> , and <UNK> ."
the entire property is very unkempt .
all for a buck !
not impressed for more than $ 00 .
". hopefully with time , they will improve ."
service was here and there .
no such luck for him .
the wine list now includes actual wines .
also ordered urban breakfast platter .
i love the unique <UNK> you can choose .
we were greeted promptly and had a minimal wait .
the pizza was pretty darn good !
we were celebrating my friend ' s birthday .
"however , this should n't be all you get ."
i inhaled that salad !

"eat greedy , yours truly - <UNK> <UNK>"

their raspberry and mango <UNK> were really nice !
the beef cannelloni is fabulous as well .
this is a small restaurant .

"from the long wait , to the unedible food ."
overall loved the resort .
this place was great !
i barely even tasted the chili .
this charming restaurant is just what phx needs !

this place is so romantic and oozes with glamour .
i guess they caught on .
it did n't stop until after 0am .

"or , maybe my standards have just gotten higher ."
the bartenders just walk right by you .
food was horrible and this place was dirty !
this is extremely inefficient and resulted in lost business .
great selection of products .
the food and ambiance is not worth the price .
for our toppings we did ricotta and <UNK> fresh .

we also had the tiramisu and the cannoli .
hubby got a mule deer this past fall .
he said ` ` that guy rocks .
the pool was nice especially with misters on .
the initial planning sessions went well .
"coffee was okay , nothing spectacular ."
think about it because they only employ 0 teller .
even another patient mentioned that it was rude !
comes out hot every time .
fantastic cocktails and beautiful ambiance .
decor : clean & modern open space .
we were feeling lazy and tired .
"their salads , eh ."

in steps whole foods market .
this place is super awesome !

be sure to try their homemade jelly .
"and surprisingly , it ' s quite spacious ."
it gets your heart pumping .
cloth napkins are a nice touch too .
my favorite part of <UNK> is actually the brownies .
there were empty tables .
they walked us to our car .
variety of hot foods to choose from !
all the dishes lacked flavor .
try the bbq pork pho !
i had the rocket salad with lox .
you may need to get your alignment checked later .
so many delicious choices .

the clams and mussels were overcooked and very chewy .
it is a worthy lunch time downtown stop .

the outdoor spa was kinda run down and unkept .
she was really warm and open to conversation .
surprised this isnt on the strip .
the drinks are normal vegas priced .
the staff was amazing !
i think i found myself a new fav place .
they offer group and individual classes .
"helpful , cheerful , funny ."
no going around this though .
"room : spacious , clean ."
try the kyle special - - it is fabulous !
i was pretty put off by the entire situation .
very light and not oily at all !

and so we did ... wow !
it took her forever to take our orders .
best hand-made tortillas ever !

"bar area , so comforting and chill ."
atmosphere is great too .
the flavor is true to pizza crust !
my husband had the lemon cake .
it ' s not luxurious .
yummy ! ! ! just like back home !
my girls got those for only $ 0.00 .
go for the foot long !
it ' s very loud inside too .
the rooms are spacious and lovely .
the appliances in my kitchen were pretty grimy .
"very tasty , but not a very large bowl ."
thank you <UNK> for the great rest stop !
so i was really disappointed .
the service was excellent !
it ' s a good idea .
she looked up my info .
"also , we all got several desserts ."
avoid the seafood at venetian .
the table cloths under the glass were also stained .
"delicious , fresh bagels at a super decent price ."
girls you know this is super necessary .
but this is vegas .
it was filled with sauteed veggies and hummus .
i think it ' s $ 0 .
soups do n't fare much better .
and again ! ! so delicious !
rude customer service is unnecessary .
i completely agree with carrie .
the chips are bland and tasteless .
best steak i have had in vegas !
makes me hesitant to ever go back !

the food is fantastic .
we did not have that .
best breakfast in town !
this place is <UNK> to the max .
the portions were pretty generous though .
service is okay but nothing spectacular .
it ' s clean and pleasant .
as 0 females we were just full .
both were overcooked and dried out .
the only bummer is the butter .
love the whole vibe to this place .
"i never made it to dessert , dang it ."
he could not get enough .
this place is absolutely heaven in my mouth .
"however , i was very disappointed in my entree ."
the highlight was definitely the tortilla .
how whack is that ?
"it ' s cupcakes , not rocket science ."
we will definitely be back .
fire codes must have been broken .
they made my expectations super high .
i do suggest sharing .
servers paul and daniel are great !
this is the best sushi i ' ve had .
we shared the salmon tartare and the caesar salad .
someone must read the yelp reviews !
the service was good .
we waited 00 min and it never came .
thank you for hosting us <UNK> !

it was worth every single cent .
this upstairs area goes all the way around .
my husband loved the french onion soup .
plus side - lunch time .
the shrimp appetizer is really good too !
again i was thrown off !
i had no clue where it had come from .
this was my first visit yesterday .
like sitting at the bar and having a drink .
crispy on the outside and dense on the inside .
everything tasted homemade and <UNK> over .
the staff was rude .
and a salad with beats - love the beats .

it took us about an hour to browse around .
everything was very fresh .
"flavoring right on , rice perfectly cooked and sauced ."
always love their dessert options and garlic naan .
just not worth the hassle .
it was a good size dish actually .
the toast was over toasted and very chewy .
"also , the ingredients are all natural ."
i will be back sooner than later .
so help them out phoenix !
i literally got a bite of everything here .
not worth it in my opinion .
the chicken was perfect .
"so we order malts again , just one ."
note that the market is covered yet open-air .
no antibiotics prescribed and no pain medication .
i would give them 0 stars if i could .
the entire staff is personable and highly trained .
i ended the call and went to their website .
. just had a weird taste .
i do wish they served much much smaller portions .

they have a drive-thru and chairs / tables outside .
"charming , historic restaurant ."

huge serving sizes but sadly not any good .
love those pickles too .

"so far , so good ."
never did see my dinner that night .
the room could have been cleaner .
i like the simultaneously calming yet high-end ambiance .
it ' s a dream .
ask for the fresh wasabi .
ca n't wait for next season !
it had tons of flavor .
i ' ll definitely go back soon !
trust me on that one .
visited for the first time yesterday .
make your reservation now !
"yes , food , not just desserts !"
which comes with syrup cooked with bacon .
i ' m so bummed !
the herb butter was magic .
"the food is good , but just good ."
it was pretty covered .
as good as it gets !
the entire team needs to get with the program .
my boyfriend had the hot wings .
all around fantastic place !
i rarely finish my food .
& whats up w / all the abc stores ?
. is still same old same old .
we wo n't be back .
i love this place .
was it worth it ?
he stayed 0 days .
we took our time and ordered the main dishes .
their frozen yogurt is always fresh and delicious .
they ' re very creamy which i like .
minus 0 stars for the extremely loud music .
beef teriyaki with veggies - so good .
i was unimpressed both times .
the hummus was thin and pasty .
i do n't love the pa they have there .
all three were so amazing !
i am not impressed .
and ordered the same pizza we had gotten before .
we finally said forget it .
i also reccomend the ham sandwich .
i love the atmosphere .
the view is amazing .
i have no complaints .
it is great for a play date .
everybody who worked in the place was super friendly .
service was awesome food was out of this world .
and the food was great !
i love the barbacoa soft tacos .
this place was great !
$ 00 and works fine now !
i was surprised at how limited .
i was served very quickly and loved the atmosphere .
"good wine , good food , and good company ."
i like this location !
<UNK> dental care was just off 000 / rainbow .
i ca n't trust your recommendations here !
why you must ask ?
my husband and i both love dr . <UNK> .
stayed because the waiter actually cared and felt bad .
they are also open 0 days a week .
i would recommend the mango mojito .
"overall , some maintenance would work ."
but ... the food just is n't great .
get with the program !
not worth another try .
"so far , so good ."
it was n't worth what they were charging .
that really ruined the end of my trip .
hopefully they get things together soon .
they do have some awesome deals .
"the food was n't bad , really ."
the food is delicious !
not too shabby for a cute coffee place !
both kids and the honey love this place .
it was just sour and very bland .
maybe i am spoiled .
yogurtland was a home run !
aj ' s is awesome .
is he new here ?
. <UNK> of sweet goodness .
what we ordered 0 .
drove from <UNK> beach !
i was sold with the word beets !
are you <UNK> kidding me .
loved that as well .
it honestly made me feel a bit uncomfortable .
and i am new .
"tender , juicy , flavorful and cooked to perfection ."
"it was delicious , our favorite breakfast in vegas !"
they are so addicting .
thanksgiving happens to be my favorite holiday !
unusual for me not to leave a clean plate .
granola and yogurt infused with honey are homemade .
we wo n't be going back .
the price is low but you get fresh ingredients .
and it was only $ 0 !
"overall , we had a great time ."
plus free soft serve !
everything seemed to melt in my mouth .
"personally , i love it ."
"a huge disappointment , skip it ."
of course it never did because it was broke .
this place is a joke !
there is a bar area toward the back .
"wrong ice cream , wrong topping ."
i decided to get a specialty cocktail .
the smell of coconut throughout the lobby is unbearable .
"the music was good , top 00s ."
there was way too much noodles .
sweet n sour sauce with them tasted good .
i told her veggie .
i wo n't be returning anytime soon .
wow was this a great surprise !
the waitress was the sweetest .
my sandwich was very delicious .
left overs for days !
looked tacky in such a nice setting .
i love this shop !
"they were polite , friendly , and so professional ."
the sign of a glorious meal !
a few of the trails were soaked !
<UNK> ! ! i hit the jackpot .
the first room is n't decorated so nicely either .
"tommy , now , is the bomb !"
we just had n't made it over there .
it was n't the server ' s fault .
must check it out .
the staff were welcoming and friendly .
it was pretty good .
i want to cry out of anger .
try all the sauces !
best kept secret of the entire place ?
did n't call my drink .
i ' m looking forward to going back soon !
everything looks gorgeous and tastes great .
i could have eaten two plates worth easily !
the food was terrible .
there were soooo <UNK> food to choose from everywhere !
i called and informed them of the same .
a must in las vegas !
they have running & training groups .
wow what amazing customer service !
pizza was gross and overpriced .
. love my nails .
their boxed lunches were great !
what a waste of air conditioning .
i find service almost always attentive .
the restaurant is clean .
have enjoyed every dish i ' ve ordered .
the service was slow .
so that ' s a bummer .
two words : crab legs .
will definitely be back .
order was ready in 00 minutes as promised .
"the steamed veggies , not my favorite ."
"again , no extra charges !"
"service is like a 0 , so borderline awful ."
we all love it .
neither time was on a weekend .
the employees are pretty nice .
do yourself a favor .
moussaka and <UNK> was alright .
they give you so .
the shakes are very yummy and incredibly filling .
the light was definitely an inconvenience .
the flavors of the ingredients did not meld together .
the service is good and people are friendly .
"yum , yum , yummy !"
it was really pricey for not good food .
"seriously , she was super great !"
"unfortunately , it was all but great ."
he deserves a raise .
"bacon , egg , lettuce and tomato ."
green beans were <UNK> with a <UNK> <UNK> sauce .
i can not say enough good things about them !
the fish is always fresh .
"however , i would n't recommend licking anything ."
our drinks were refilled often without being asked .
it was a paid event .
i doubt few go back after the 0st time .
reservation representative named kevin was rude .
"+ small , tiny restaurant thats quite cozy ."
the food is very authentic and delicious .
this is one of my new favorite dessert places !
overall a great experience and definitely will go back .
i would n't go back .
went here for a wedding rehearsal dinner .
man what a bummer .
loved the purple rice .
we started with the tableside guacamole .
i really liked this hotel and would stay again .
the bellini is good and strong .
oh and the place is welcoming and clean .
that in itself is so wack to me .
i can go on and on .
i always appreciate that .
they brought us four different appetizers .
they gave us a room on the 00th floor !
this is certainly one of my favorite <UNK> .

the twins get the crowd more involved .
"hey , it ' s vegas ."
the guacamole and salsa flight are both really tasty .

definitely not worth the wait .
everyone had a smile on their face .
i <UNK> my teeth and swallowed .
this company is n't worth the money .
our server was also very friendly and funny .
i would definitely not get a pasta dish though .
these combined with a cup of coffee = heaven .
the staff we encountered was also friendly and helpful .
their oven must be drier .
no one wants you here .
<UNK> ' s it was !
we really enjoyed blt burger and the buffet .
the food was taste but was cold .

they print the password on your receipt .
"good , affordable lunch menu ."
pretty decent for a bagel place .
"also , i like that bags fly free ."

he arrived on time and was pretty friendly .
breakfast is better than lunch here !
also the no lettuce and tomato ?
the plates are huge so come with empty stomachs .
i never have though !
the sushi itself is delicious .
we knew it would be super crowded .
the best burgers in madison ... hands down !

the food was absolutely disgusting .
"five minutes pass , no acknowledgment from waitress ."
downtown summerlin is the place to go !
everything looks so yummy on that menu !
p i g m a c !
we could n't resist trying the chantilly cake .
the best thing is dessert !
not sure i ' d go back right away .
& the vibe is really wicked .
i wish all rv parks were like this one !
the fruit also went slowly .
has lots of potential though .
everyone wants to get in and everyone ... .
so it ' s clearly good for larger groups .
the dinner buffet was terrible .
great addition to dc ranch !
everything was perfect and the service was exceptional .
i also really love the space .
not one for the raw stuff ?
it can get crazy and crazy expensive .
- rrb - the staff is friendly .
talk about to die for .

the salad dressing they use is amazing and unique .
figure that one out .
what does that include ?
great off strip location and not hard to find .
$ 0.00 for an ice cream scoop .
and the sides ... the sides !
my only complaint was the seating .

our dinner was delicious .
we were seated outside and promptly forgotten about .

we had n't even ordered drinks yet .
i can not recommend them highly enough .
it was really good .
read the other reviews .
both dishes were highly recommended by our waiter .
the entire staff is super friendly and sociable .
too much sauce on everything .
we had a deluxe room with 0 queen beds .
the rooms were very clean and had no problems .
decor : tables are ugly .
we upgraded for pretzels on the side .
my husband and i came here yesterday for lunch .
be prepared to spend a while touring this place .

each place has its own menu .
i could see using it at home .
the dessert was not very memorable .
i would definitely recommend them .
. delish so many other things to try there .
housekeeping was obviously doing a very half-assed job .
we got breakfast and the food was pretty good !

"well , happy <UNK> !"
there was a small variety of different food .
i seriously love pita jungle .
no red sauce needed !
we stayed here because our room was comped .
"when it arrived , it seemed quite small ."
this is a lovely little gem .
the ones we got must have been old .
why do i like it ?
ca n't go wrong with bacon .
way too salty too .
0/0 off apps and drinks .
and it ' s true .
i will never go back !

the downsides ... service was friendly but slow .
"basically , everything was just okay ."
the blood orange martini is fantastic !
so so so bad .

we got the chocolate fondue .
more coffee - less water ?
the popcorn was good .
the bakery items are ridiculous .
then i went back and had a coffee one .
healthy food and fun ambiance .
poor service ... <UNK> - lrb - owner ?
they added mixed vegetables for only $ 0.00 .
lots of great options and a fun environment !
they were closing and they still accommodated us .
they had exactly what i was looking for .
it is the hot pots that take a while .
how backwards is that ?
"linda , karen nicole & cliff"
"as for the service , i am always impressed ."

luscious vanilla chairs like you see in hotel <UNK> .

they ' ve never let us down .
then we prepared corn tortillas and cooked them .

"ehh , it ' s ok ."
the atmosphere in a nutshell : <UNK> in bed !
great play of textures and flavors .

"and , again , really really good ."
experienced a fun and festive evening !
i can honestly say i do n't like beets .
great place and worth checking it out !

everything about this dish was delectable .
good if you can handle spice !
"hands down , this is the best arizona location ."
the latte was yummy & beautiful .
i prefer to drink white zinfandel .
it had a delicious pesto sauce .

i do n't like rolls that much anymore .
my personal favorite is the eggs benedict .
i would definitely come back .
my first visit here and i love this place .

only complaint is it was a little cramped .
biscuits and gravy made me sick .
the food is yummy too .
the waitress was very attentive and friendly .
& good service too very clean classic french food .
yummy mozzarella and ricotta cheese on <UNK> crust .
the salads come with homemade croutons which are delicious .

the haus brat tastes mostly like dried oregano .
i asked if they could fix my toe .
i tried them all and was impressed !
your tip depends on it .
we had <UNK> service right from the beginning .
and happy hour specials on tacos and beer !
i ' ve had better elsewhere and less expensive .
this may have something to do with my <UNK> .
the burgers were perfect size too .
good variety of table games and machines .
"yo cuz , do n't break his balls !"
we were a party of 0 .
i would totally go again !
"oh , and dont ' order the berry smoothie ."

. the foods ok .
as for their sushi ... who knows ?
we ' ve never had poutine this good before .

. fresh mexican grill with great sauces !
then there ' s the service .
"yeah , we know how to hack life ."
are you kidding me ?
"my uncle had another appetizer , a calamari salad ."
service was good as usual !
the casino floor smells of smoke .
we got extra discounts because we asked !
food is fair at best ! !
wall mirrors and clocks are everywhere .
that was n't the worst part however .

she was kind after that .
"despite this , we will go back ."
otherwise good prices & clean place .
i was jonesing for chicken tikka masala .

is it worth the calories ?
the service was not good .
' ' i ca n't <UNK> that .

it made the night run smoothly .
the staff is friendly .

the cost is $ 00.00 per person .
great awesome honest service .
the lady replied yes we have that .
"this was good , but it was very rich ."
the service was great .
and i had opportunity .
"not drying , not overcooked ."
the food is not that impressive .
their wait staff is truly kind and wonderful !
0 - rrb - saturday nights are busy !
"cajun calamari is good , small portion though ."
our waitress was very attentive and nice .
this management company is just okay .
so <UNK> ' s a plus for sure .
it gets busy but is worth the crowd !
we went here to meet some friends .
but never have i had it for breakfast before .
bill came out to about $ 0000 but .
"apparently , this is very french ."
the smoked duck with beet salad was amazing .
surprised too since it was always quite busy .
the creme on top was a little off .
it ' s not chain .

my friends and i had an amazing time .
we could n't be happier with the results !
what a waste of money .
if i could give it more stars i would .
we ordered the mini caramel flan for dessert .
lots of tofu not enough pork .
the lighting in the rooms is awful .
i highly recommend this place for late night dining .
"our server was nice , but a bit slow ."

all their pizzas are deliciously made !
the staff were mellow .
i will be back amazing food and service !

i also thought the service was just ok .
i love that it ' s organized by size .
the atmosphere set such a great mood for me .

it ' s okay but definitely not the best .
we opted to take a seat outside .
it was really good .
we had a lovely dinner .
the meal i had at sage was the best .
i loved the design of the restaurant .
i opt to gamble at the casinos nearby anyway .
"and we are always treated very , very well ."
i went here for my birthday last night .
fukumimi ' s ramen is so good .
it was even better .
"also , the pedicure lasted for about <UNK> minutes ."
i should have listened to the other helpers .
this was my first time in this restaurant .
pre-game in your hotel room before hand .

the mozzarella sticks made from scratch were also delicious !
a pittsburgh staple is an understatement !
we are moving into the perfect house !
$ 0 a piece .
cilantro steak was delicious .
he is attentive and serves delicious drinks .
visited this labor day for breakfast .
and may i suggest trying a vegetarian pasty ?

my server was so sweet and open with recommendations .
. - rrb - available in this store .

my fave go-to for any occasion .
it shows a lack of compassion & class .

"kids are happy , parents are happy ."
it ' s too ghetto .

everything was over priced for the quality of food .
we should have taken the upgrade .

on to the main course ... .
all we could say was wow !
but i ' m glad i rushed .
not too sweet and no weird artificial flavors .
"you can tell they use fresh , local ingredients ."
"not too sweet , and not too tart ."
the main dipping sauce is black vinegar after all .
so they all fell apart into little tiny pieces .
we got there around 00:00 am .
all of the above including our cocktails and service .
but stick to the burgers !
too bad my mother did n't do the same .
the decor is very nice .

interesting set up and restaurant !
"now for the part about the dessert , <UNK> !"
since i ordered a healthier that day .

the portions are tiny !
not to mention the extremely nice and helpful staff !
this restaurant is a hidden gem !
and a lot healthier than the mainstream versions !
let me say ... it was worth the drive !
smaller than jean talon market for sure .
definitely worth a repeat .
it took forever for someone to take our order .
my response was easy lol .
their food is fresh and the staff is awesome .
"thin crust , fresh toppings ."
you all must visit .
i could n't get enough of this !
we sat outside on the wonderful patio .
we got seated right away at the bar .
overall rating was because of the lack in service .
i always get the eggplant stir fry .
do n't waste your time dining here .
<UNK> is so talented !
maybe it is good for ppl live near by .
"she seemed irritated and actually , snobby ."
great show for kids and family ! ! !
"lastly , i peruse the accessories ."

if only it had been free !
for $ 00 you had no choices ... none .
"or better yet , a mimosa ."
the smell was really <UNK> me out .
and they are friendly and smiling .
mac salad was good though .
i found it at winghart ' s .
my favorite were the sweet options .
i ' m laid back like that .
we sat right by the bar / kitchen .
it takes away from the appeal of going .
butter both sides for the texas toast !
"yes , they accept cards now ."
donuts made fresh to order !
always worth a visit to check out the clearance .
the strawberries that they gave me were delicious !
i think they still have wi-fi .
0/0 beef panang : creamy curry and coconut sauce .
great service and premium beer and drink specials !
love their combo plates with noodles instead of rice .

"however , my experience was ... ."
our server was very friendly and had good recommendations .
great people and even better food !
he was very thorough .
booths line one wall inside that seat four .
i absolutely adore this place .

better than most seafood houses at the beach .
this place is delicious .
they give a generous amount of ramen and soup .
i love the outdoor area to sit while waiting .
cold spaghetti ! ! hardly any sauce !

the pool was a huge circle in the ground .
how much better can it get ?
not only did he corrected the situation .
the lo mein is my absolute favorite !
<UNK> had not been ruined by emeril after all .

i was just none too thrilled with its <UNK> .
the burger was a perfect balance of ingredients .
"also had the broccoli , yummmmm !"
i will certainly be returning .
she ' s a firecracker .
i may have found my go-to asian restaurant .

cook up a new plate instead .
service not so much .
nine of us went to this location .
it has such a romantic and <UNK> vibe .
we even went back to order more .
the food was great .
i really ca n't say enough about the service .
the atmosphere is super soothing and relaxing as well .
highly recommend to friends and family .
nearly 00 minutes just for that .
and the melted gruyere was nice and cheesy !
this place is beautiful on the inside .
the steak and egg is the greatest !
will return for the tots .
it ' s all made-to-order .
super thin and perfect !
we had an excellent meal .
accompanied by fresh fruits and their herb potatoes .
needless to say we received very neglectful service
"alright , alright , i will calm down ."
now for the lemon cupcake .

"finally , our waitress appeared ."
the sandwich was delicious .
always a good choice !
"overall , i ' d say 0.0 stars ."

we came for happy hour .
the waitress was great .

and he cried for more .
i was completely grossed out .
"i know , its an illness ."
to start the guacamole was bland .
my guest thanked me for days for bringing them .
the butter sauce was delicious .
the food was very disappointing .

great service as well .
parking here can be bad especially on weekends .
"absolutely lovely evening here , i will definitely return ."
$ 000 all in .
the best perk to this costco ?
overall good service with decent timing between courses .
they deliver to local area .
they should have never boarded me on the flight .
the pool was closed quite often too .
"so , i decided to visit the original location ."
the baba ghanoush was great !
the atmosphere and service are amazing .
definitely one to sip on .
other than that i ' m speechless .
the prime rib was really good .

the almond cookies were so so .
so it might have been nothing .

you will not regret it !
we had the smoked trout and the gnocchi .
far back corner of the mall / lot .
i will for sure come back !

i was <UNK> <UNK> .
but they did sound good .
i will be back .
i would recommend this to all !
it ' s a really new place .
we came without reservations and were seated quickly .
they also give you sample cups .
they are n't really personable .
she was snappy about it too .
they also have many roll choices .
taken right to our table .
also the waiting area is small but very nice .
the dumplings were absolutely adorable .
this was our first experience and last one .
i have visited <UNK> twice .
i would probably go back .
definitely a good place for some fun !
i actually refused them because they were so cold .
my husband and i make frequent visits to vegas .
i ca n't sing their praises enough .
. definitely would order that again .
really disappointing for both of us .
we ordered edamame to start .
the raw oysters are to die for !
i ca n't wait to go back .
"so , my dad smoked ."
the cirque performers were just there .
a fantastic view of the strip ! ! !
and i do n't mean bud light .
all the hotties seem to flock here ...
was pretty apathetic the whole time .
everyone was very friendly and professional .
<UNK> our food in got check .
how this place has 0 stars is beyond me .
- the no0dp will always have his garlic bread .
service was awesome meh .
and their service is definitely 0 stars too .
they could n't have been nicer to us .
we were told to go to number 0 .
they were an instant hit and instant snack necessity .
meh i was under <UNK> .
this is the devils playground .
it was perfect for our family of six !
. people are friendly especially jeremy !
we were <UNK> eating it when our salads arrived .
overall dining experience was underwhelmed .
same as every other rainforest cafe .
i would recommend creative moving 000 % .
steamed mussels - 0 stars !
when he got there no work had been done .
they will not pay .
what ' s not to love ?
not very ` ` green .
we are absolutely grateful for dr . <UNK> !
everything in the store is on sale .
<UNK> is my new obsession !
again why did i wait so long ?
i just asked them to come change it .
i had a lovely stay here .
oh and the taste was the same .
friendly doctor and staff !
ps ... dont get the appetizer sampler .
i feel very violated .
this place was delicious !
it ' s a number i do n't recognize .
could n't hear the people next to me .
it ' s still just ok .
they also offer homemade baklava .
but i realized something .
highlight are the super fresh noodles .
love that they post the calories !
will definitely go back .
the fruit was old .
"yes , you can also add fried chicken ."
it was the orange beef that did me in .
"the location is really , really rough ."
i ordered the aubergine and miso which was amazing .
that ' s a lot !
it even smells funny .
the <UNK> pizza was light and flavorful .
"while in line , i eyed the sweets ."
but i thought it was worth every penny .
my dining partner got the wow !
and then our entrees came out in record speed .
it is so refreshing and very cooling .
would n't give us our total for delivery .
i just wish this place was open later .
"instead , he brought the check which was discounted ."
thank you for opening up in my neighborhood !
we ' ll be back !
waitress has a language barrier .
my first time at <UNK> <UNK> .
it was sooo delicious .
"typical gas station , nothing fancy about it ... ."
you can not go wrong with the blue taj !
"that ' s why we asked first , honey ."
i will def go back here .
get the family special !
took less than 00 minutes .
"love the jacuzzis , pool and gym !"
right up my alley .
just a round pool .
the food was so overpriced for what it was .
"great atmosphere , children friendly and very laid back ."
"we got free kid spoons , too ."
so happy i found this place !
do not rent here .
the food was decent .
check it out for yourself .
they looked a bit busy for a wednesday night .
the lobster spread is addictive and light .
it was decent and i would get it again .
you will love this place !
i will definitely be back .
no problem making accommodations for our needs .
i found my vegas breakfast spot !
oh how wrong i was .
this added a personal touch that enhanced our experience .
i ' m already a fan .
our waitress seemed knowledgeable and made good suggestions .
only downfall this year was no hot showers .
best quote by far .
we ' ll go back .
i also like the free <UNK> .
i hate that pretentious crap .
they also have a wall of salt water taffy .
never will i forget the blue soup .
we loved the appetizers .
pizza with jalapenos and it was <UNK> .
the grilled cheese was really good .
can you say ghetto ?
i hate poor customer service .
it ' s definitely a hidden gem ! !
00 day <UNK> if unsatisfied with product .
the service was attentive and friendly .
i played <UNK> majority of the time !
i love wisconsin spicy !
i just need some needle nose <UNK> .
it ' s like a love / hate relationship !
' ' she was partly correct .
i loved my tofu scramble !
they have a pretty big selection of food .
i guess i expected it bigger and sweeter .
i fell in love with korean food here .
they are great at pick up orders .
we will definitely be back .
i loved this store !
but maybe i have .
the chefs ' sushi making seemed very inexperienced .
go now ! ! do not wait !
i do n't think i would come back .
fans would have helped .
she was a complete <UNK> .
i have been here a couple of times .
"would definitely return , though ."
but it is vegas and it is lobster .
went in the store today to buy baby furniture .
they used to be my go-to !
"plus , the containers are so cute !"
all and all my stay here was good .
highly recommend it to everybody !
she was rude i love this place !
i love the food .
ordered the chianti which was reasonable for $ 0 .
spaghetti - so amazing .
i liked this place .
they had salads with a great selection of topics !
they were very delicious .
can not wait to go back .
beer is also worth a try !
i asked the bartender for an old-fashioned .
i ' ve had better .
listening to the customer is key .
everyone is always smiling .
overall a nice experience .
- 0 star because it needs major renovations !
it was so fun .
i think it was half a chicken .
this is my favorite lunch spot to go to .
the <UNK> : hours !
the biggest change i noticed was in their ramen .
thai noodles definitely passed his approval .
all the staff is really nice and helpful .
"so yeah , guess what i ordered ?"
i have never had a bad milk shake here .
beef stew noodle soup - omg .
i opted for having him call .
you can reserve seats ahead of time .
"oh well , when in scottsdale ... ."
one of the most affordable fresh fish stores around .
not really wat i wanted to experience .
look at the black board in the bar area .
very cheap liquor prices too .
the sign outside says so .
"unfortunately , we wo n't be going back here ."
the atmosphere was amazing here everyone was so friendly .
"good to know , right ?"
. the bf got some avocado omelette .
i ' m so addicted .
it had a perfect blend of tastes .
would recommend this place to everyone .
the owner is the star at <UNK> .
this is a great place for a seafood lover .
the location was clean and well kept .
nothing ever comes close to this place !
"their complimentary salsa and chips were good , too ."
very friendly man working here .
but whatever the reason - it was bad .
the temperature inside the restaurant was comfortable and enjoyable .
best swimming school i have been to !
he also needed his lil nails clipped .
i will be back .
we loved the beans .
he definitely made the check in effortless !
- no coffee makers in the room .
the pain was terrible .
my husband was so excited and surprised .
we are back to our every friday jumbo tub !
there is absolutely nothing bland about their burgers .
but nothing to write home about .
it ' s huge sushi rolls lol !
my favorite bar in las vegas .
prices are great and so is the food .
this is hands down our favorite place to eat .
the food is usually pretty decent .
my boyfriend and i really liked the lobster roll .
sorry to be such an inconvenience .
i was n't impressed with the atmosphere here .
the owner is very personable .
still one of my favorite organizations !
it kept my daughter well entertained .
the baristas are always so friendly as well .
the music played was mostly 00s and early 00s .
i love there chicken katsu here .
"that being said , housekeeping was great ."
slots not loose but fun for a while .
but i found it in me to keep going .
cod <UNK> - we were warned they were different .
the one i got here looks awful .
"amazing food , drinks , and the best service !"
not gon na lie .
the waiter never returned with our bill .
really not worth it .
"still , it was beautifully presented ."
now that ' s a bonus in my book .
only drawback is the weekend crowds .
the service could have been better .
california spoiled me with the discovery of macarons .
for dessert - <UNK> !
a great evening and all under one roof !
"moreover , the service was super friendly and attentive ."
it is such a great place .
we ' ll be back !
we love love love this place .

"for small plates , they were still decent portions ."
i had a friend drive me .

this place has four different ceviches ... <UNK> !
my favorite place to visit for dessert !
the jerky was good .
the one plus there is the lazy river .
the decor is amazing .
as a bonus - the drinks are cool !
the food is great and service is great too !
"handling meats , veggies etc with out gloves ."
"great services , great menu simply fresh & delicious !"
we ended up staying for quite some time .
sometimes the classes are half off in slower months .
and it tastes like sink water .
this one just did n't live up to it .
it was pretty busy for a wednesday night .
and incredibly terrible as a waitress - - ie .
super comfy and warm .
the dressing is a pregnancy craving !
. ramen and boba teas with the hot pot !
we were immediately taken by the atmosphere .
went in here last night for dinner .
they have a little playground for the kids .
i know its a chicken shack .
they close at 0:00 .
the service was great and attentive .
bbq chicken was moist and flavorful !
ca n't ask for much more in a restaurant .
will be back here for sure !
here is my take on this place 0 .
their margarita was blech too .
let me say our shrimp cocktail was very good .
it ' s very refreshing and deliciously fresh .
urban tacos it is !
dear lord i could consume buckets of this nectar .
this made our morning !
. i love the diner feel of <UNK> .
not even the large size !
the food was also delicious - small portions .
yum ! ! chicken strips are great !
pleasantly surprised and delighted .
bummer because this was my favorite place so far !
"wine , food and pizza were all ordered ."
went there on 00/0 for lunch .
overall a pleasant stay during our recent vegas getaway .
all for around $ 00 this place is delicious !
this location is take out only .
just did take out .
or service was terrible .
i do n't like potato chips with my breakfast .
the salad was light and crisp .
owners are jerks ! ! service sucks !
our three cats give 00 paws up !
we loved that it was smoke-free and very quiet .
<UNK> came to our rescue .
we decided to give it a shot .
we decided to send this back .
we also ordered two half dinners .
i am definitely going back !
two thumbs enthusiastically up !
"impeccable service , delicious food , and beautiful ambiance ."
i ' ve had good thai food .
"crowded , especially on weekends ."
we are used to churches that are alive .
i actually like a little fire to my meals .
will definitely be back .
and they put lime wedges in my takeout container !
"but , i truly appreciated all the great deals ."
my chicken quesadilla was 00 dollars .
another upside was their affordable prices .
and waiting for the check is ridiculous .
the calamari with zucchini straws was perfect !
they do not care for their clients .
"broth was good , just a little kick ."
by far my favorite fro-yo place .
who does n't love super crispy bacon for lunch ?
daughter had a cavity filled and again no issues .
no balsamic on it .
enjoyed the red velvet and the vanilla chocolate swirl .
i absolutely adore this place .
definitely check this place out !
the tortellini is my fave !
i told her to get control of her dog .
i defiantly will come here again .
has a great view .
spend your money <UNK> .
"the food , service & prices were great ."
the view was amazing !
barro ' s is worth the drive into anthem .
the <UNK> was a little dry .
but this smells of perfection and happiness !

first time here tonight !
everyone loved their burgers .
my husband and i always eat our pie first .
i agree with tim b .
this is the worlds highest ride .
he was arrested and went to trial .
the au jus was to die for .
"currently , their business hours are limited ."
the croissant was so good .
another food network find ... .
oh my gosh i love this place !
the servers were always nice and efficient .
i also absolutely love love love their tuna sandwich .
the amaretto is also decent .
big chunks with no creamy goodness .
it was okay ... i ate several pieces .
and this just was n't .
"get your act together , thai cottage ."
"we are n't gamblers , and hate cigarette smoke ."
we arrived at about 00:00 .
"i might be back , i might not ."
jimmy was the best server ever !
i definitely could have done 000 times better .
lively & cozy atmosphere .
very odd set up .
the brisket was nice and smoky !
' to this restaurant !
i have never experienced worse service in my life .
def has become my fav froyo spot .
desserts definitely saved this buffet for me .
still worth it for the chips and salsa .
"the owner , julia is awesome to work with !"
timo did an absolutely amazing job .
. definitely not worth the price ! ! !
our service was nothing short of horrendous .
one we got had an awful chemical taste .
you have to order the chicken shish kabobs !
"next time , i ' ll take the wait ."
not so with this show .
"overall , a great experience ."
it comes on top of a waffle .
would never go again !
there are very few spots to park for free .
they also give a military discount !
it was worth every penny .
the staff was very friendly and accommodating .
"overall , overpriced for the taste of the food ."
stay away from this store .
they were all incredibly friendly and attentive .
"if it ' s busy , be patient ."

would definitely go back with friends .
the <UNK> <UNK> to start is a must .
i just ca n't .
the room was n't too bad .
another nice surprise on our road trip .
they have very low quality food .
love the international mix .
"entertaining , amusing , had me constantly laughing ."
but <UNK> it makes wonderful hangover food .
that title would have to go to zumanity .
"average food , average wine ."
then i got out .
we ' ll be back !
it was extremely loud and hard to talk .
"the prices of goods are cheap , too ."
the staff is super nice and helpful .
i would go earlier and not as often .
were the cocktails fabulous ?
we always take our leftovers home .
i finally got the opportunity to go to night !
i think burgers are def .
i highly recommend this place to everyone .
i tried all of them .
"but , husband forced it down ."
love the food and the ambiance here .
not sure if they take reservations .
i really like their bibimbap .
we walked inside to find a hostess looking person .
homemade sorbet was off the charts .
i want to go again and again and again .
"other than that , do n't give up !"
not bad but not my favorite .
five years is like 00 in computers apparently .
garlic spinach - do not expect american spinach .
super yummy wraps and fast service !
i usually order a filet - lrb - great !
it was absolutely delicious !
never going back to this place !
then had coffee & banana bread .
the nacho chips were fresh and warm .
our service was quite attentive .
yes the tucson transplants rejoice !
"supposedly , they are right there for you ."
but i did get rice .
the last time it was just so-so .
miko ' s gets a gold star !
i think the prices are high for the quality .
"oh sahara , how i miss you !"
way too overly priced .
the wine and the cheese fondue were delicious .

the roasted beet and arugula salad was ok .
i took a bite and could n't finish it .
the taro smoothie was perfectly sweetened .
finally got to check out dormont dogs !
tried a different bruschetta this time .
"in short , it exceeded my expectations ."
the philly steak egg rolls are amazing !
the flavor was bland .
not fun - i know !
they have a sauce bar !
the perfect end to a meal !
"my noodle lovers , its a must go !"
the office staff is very professional and polite .
i ' m onto you .
all of the other food was yummy too .
it looks like animal abuse to me .
i would say this .
the chocolates itself was excellent .
thanks for all the previous reviews !
ca n't wait to go back !
"it ' s worth it , though !"
wasted my time coming here i think .
the chicken breast was very moist .
really good on one side .
- rrb - as well as their homemade chips .
your full montagu was quite delicious .
we will not be going back .
it had flavor and tasted fresh .
the server had no serving skills whatsoever .
' ' ` ` that ' s okay .
yesterday i went with 0 friends for dinner .
"she was patient , attentive and friendly ."
the drinks are delicious and they use fresh ingredients .
the food : basic menu leaves something lacking .
"love the food , service is ` ` meh ."
when the salad came out it was colorful .
it was the perfect setting for an easter brunch .
i of course got the chicken and waffles .
drinks were pricey but good .
this does not sound christian to me .
parking : parking is okay .
that was until i found just in time .
wish we had tried something else on the menu .
couple more minutes passes .
we got here around 00pm .
so fresh and tasty !
was it worth the price ?
may we have many days together ... .
ambience : it ' s not too loud .
atmosphere : quaint and intimate but roomy enough .
likewise for the waitress .
"i am out $ 00,000 in ugly <UNK> flooring ."
we all agreed that the dishes were mediocre .
the waitress that served us was awesome .
best word to describe cuisine <UNK> : decent .
i highly recommend cafe <UNK> !
literally not one smile or kind remark .
the guys that work there are always welcoming !
i always dig creative flavors and sundaes .
the only weird part was paying for our meal .
two words : truffle honey .
it ' s so distracting .
i love the market street cafe .
"mmm , baked potatoes ."
try the scallops in the blood orange sauce !
everything was so good .
gordon ramsay really delivers here .

i have found the perfect therapist for me .
from what i remember it was just ok .

and it was really loud .
this place is legit !
the tub ... oh goodness .
the two staff members were very pleasant .
i love the culture of secret pizza .

she is one of my favorite country artists .
their entrees are plentiful and great for sharing .
my filet was very salty and charred .

we ' ll do that .
of course i was in !
absolute love the concept here .
i ' ll probably skip them next time .
i thought there was not enough of it .
and i really like cinnamon rolls .

- rrb - with a tower suite key ps .
bottle service was great .
not really my thing .
my husband loves their fish tacos .

it ' s perfect for whatever <UNK> you !
other than that we had a wonderful time !
thankfully they validated parking .
it ' s hard to get that nice balance .
they brought it to me at once .
is well worth the drive .
they should be called rice zen !
and it ' s clear it ' s money .
i truly love supporting this restaurant .
i was bummed out .
i got my teeth cleaned here .
"mmmmm , some seriously good diner food !"
i would highly advise avoiding her section .

i can also recommend the chai tea .
special thanks to valet ppl .

and delicious it is .
just the right amount of sweet to savory balance .
"funny , entertaining , sexy and interactive ."
not to shabby if i do say so myself .
so cute yet had to be eaten !
each staff member was friendly .
i opt for the everything bagel .
the shoe department is upstairs .
i loved the desserts they had .
i ' d highly recommend it ! !
my favorite was the orange marmalade one .
they are quick and the ingredients are good .
the tables are kept very clean too .
i substituted the dal / salad for roti .
simple yet delectable in taste .
enough kitchen utensils to please emeril .
this treat followed a delightful <UNK> .
we were seated in the back .
they are hand crafted and amazing !
everything was amazingly delish !
the food there is great also !
very speedy service - multiple people working the counter .
did you that there are different types of rum ?
drinks were 00 a pop .
i felt at ease going in .
i hear it gets pretty busy though .
the sandwiches come out hot and to order .
the service was seriously lacking as well .
i ' ll continue to come here for service !
i would n't recommend the ayce though .
. both dishes were delectable .
the service has been excellent .
highly recommend you check this place out !
"caring , compassionate and thorough ."
i love going here for their pastries !
love that gel polish change is only 00 $ !
loved the rollercoaster and all the great restaurants .

we just wish it was closer !
not so much this time .
very filling pizza for $ 0.00 .
you will not find a better salon !
opulent by all means !
sooo why the 0 stars ?
i love their toast !
there is even a tv in there !
not necessarily to me but another customer .
"but overall , i enjoyed my evening here ."
the service was great but the food was subpar .
i cant wait to go back .
coming back for sure .
"overall , worth every penny ."
the salmon was very tender and flavorful .
"all local food , delicious , and incredibly affordable ."
ca n't beat that !
"friendly , fast service - <UNK> we love you !"

she says she does .
something different and delicious .
the most delicious thing ever !
so far not impressed with this place .
they also do trivia night which is free !
it was all delicious .
however we went with it .
the woman would not let it go .
the service here is just as impressive !
we had a great experience .
"anyways , been here twice ."
"also , the <UNK> dishes were decent too ."
and it really should n't matter .
not eager to come back .
<UNK> i hate having to go back .
opt for meatballs and ricotta !
my fave was definitely the hanger steak .
coming here was a pleasant surprise !
price was really affordable and service was pretty average .
we were given the choice of the bar .
this was also enough for my husband .
i did not even receive an apology .
bartender was nice but not very personable .
will be back berry soon !
! ! my new favorite .
so here we go ... .
i scheduled a 00 minute facial with irene .
they have not hired appropriate personnel .
the pasta was disgusting .
the coffee here is awesome !
the service is delightful .
"since i love both cuisines , i became overwhelmed ."
i love this store !
these were pretty tasty !
enough for two people fo ' sho ' !
still tasty but not ideal .
"high <UNK> , classy decor , clean ."
i personally have never had it .
the lettuce mexican chicken tacos are only 000 calories .
would not go back to this place
plus it moves fast .
do yourself a favor do n't go !
this place is definately a dive !
and the greens ... to die for !
the staff has been there forever .
i ' m very impressed with the service .
i love this place !
best ice cream shop !
"- rrb - alright , alright ."
this location of pac sun is horrible .
so i stole some of hers ... .
this space is really beyond words .
"movies at the pool , <UNK> , and food ."
that ' s how awesome it is .
free bags is definitely a bonus .
"we tried a <UNK> , which was really good ."
i drank it so it would go away .
wifi is awesome as well .
"in fact , the overall experience might be better !"
and they offer that in spades .
see you next time !
it won me over in every way possible .
we came here on a saturday night .
my taco was a little on the bland side .
super delicious and a great atmosphere .
the servers always seem annoyed .
how does this place only have 0 stars ?
i have gotten fresh pizza faster .
we will definitely return .
prairie is exactly the way a cafe should be .
"we ate for breakfast , lunch , and dinner ."
mixed review for this store .
this allows you to see the band and audience .
i would not come back here .
it ' s an interesting location .
our server was pretty friendly .
but the highlight of our visit was our server !
the owners & evening bartender are friendly and inviting .
i really do n't think we will go back .
"really no complaints , i love this place now ."
everything was hot and everything came out together .
you ca n't beat the marriott mattress .
after you get your food and drinks they disappear .
not a whole lot .
my only complaint was the online ordering .
every place has a special dish .
i was in heaven .
i absolutely love this starbucks location !
"overall , it was well balanced ."
we have been there several times over the years .
this restaurant is on the repeat list for sure !
he refilled our drinks without being asked to .
"so , why the two stars ?"
"good , i thought ."
"went for breakfast , for a specific bagel ."
first of all cover $ 00 .
both meals were delicious .
nothing wild about <UNK> mushrooms in my opinion !
i will certainly be back to try more !
they have tv ' s everywhere .
i had so much fun !
it ' s always scorching in here .
there ' s not enough time !
the important highlights are : - cash only .
i had the shrimp fajitas and they were bomb !
best pizza i ' ve ever had !
they are so good .
"nice atmosphere , but it lacked everywhere else !"
careful eating the stuff there !
i was such a good decision !
i love the garlic and brie appetizer .
i do n't know .
people dont know what to do with themselves .
<UNK> was a dream .
"first , those that i love !"
it was simple but pleasant .
scallion pancake was really good .
must get the jarred tuna !
he just did n't care about me !
both always tasty and delightful !
i was afraid to touch anything .
it was so good !
i choose to stay here every chance i get .
"hey , we were celebrating a birthday !"
i really like their coffee oreo shake .
love the personal service ! !
thank you <UNK> and greg for nothing .
verdict : - get the pan roast only .
first time 00 minute wait for an unmemorable sandwich .
i am so sad to leave !
the slot machines were a joke .
we hope to visit again next year .
"first of all , it does n't have self-parking ."
the venetian is beautiful .
"thankfully , i discovered lola ' s !"
staff was always friendly and inviting and remembers you .
"she apologized again , nicely , then walked away ."
i was a bit disappointed there .
"it is a beautiful , breathtaking aquatic show ."
the kids loved the swimming pool with the slide .
and i loved that table side service .
i did n't feel obligated or pushed .
overall it was a great party .
mainly because of the food !
j was not at all impressed .
. it ' s $ 0 not a <UNK> .
a lovely place to celebrate a special event .
he was over the top and loud .
stuff i would a totally wear .
my husband got the fisherman ' s selection .
we will be returning on a regular basis !
but it is worth it !
i love this place !
you ca n't beat that !
it ' s too bad !
we were just not impressed with taste .
ohhhh how i miss vegas ... .
"love , love , love !"
you have to pay for your seat .
we snagged a bottle of vino and a baguette .
the ice machine was broken .
luckily i ' m already on <UNK> .
do n't waste your time .
order it if offered .
first and last time coming here !
very concise but still had many options .
and they do n't mess around .
the positive : affordable lunch specials and generous portions .
i would recommend this restaurant to anyone !
there was only shower <UNK> left .
"the bread was fresh , chewy , and substantial ."
will definitely stay again .
the selection of treats are amazing .
one of my absolute favorites !
asked for egg white .
i ate the whole burger it was so good .
the food was n't that impressive .
i personally recommend the <UNK> black tea .
so totally worth the wait !
the right balance of heat and sour .
i was extremely full after finishing the entire thing .
others are just doing a job .
do n't get me wrong .
the best thing i tried were the mashed potatoes .
tasty gravy with nice big chunks of sausage !
i have had the buttermilk and the coconut type .
wednesdays are double punch days .
never encountered any issues with them .
the hostess was friendly and seated us right away .
he came out with an attitude .
"before they both left , i felt like home ."
the room over all was what we needed .
i love houston ' s !
lentil soup of the day ... sooooo good !
and you feel such an adrenaline rush afterwards .
i found it to be too rich .
the staff is really friendly and talkative .
my friends and i go here a lot .
first off another yelp name change .
that ' s what i ' m talking about !
much better ... and they are still really friendly .
clean and cute decor .
"however , i have never had good service ."
i really enjoyed the entire vibe of this place .
carry on folks and know that both are fabulous !
. i hate that i arrived at 0000pm .
"quaint , local restaurant ."
everything was delicious and up to par !
the service was a little inefficient but friendly .
vip tickets are worth it for a better view .
i love dr . campbell .
"also , the beer battered jalapeno pickles were bomb !"
and they ' re friendly : - rrb - .
"sweet baby jesus , yes ."
the people are always nice and friendly .
just do n't do it .
"wow , i do n't get the great reviews ."
just fix it and do n't <UNK> ?
our server was attentive and on point .
no tip for them .
it ' s fun and convenient .
everyone is friendly and fast .
would come back again and again .
good for sushi fix .
they even have a play area for him !
ambience is fun and happy .
passion fruit margaritas and mojitos are yum !
the food is amazing !
what a wonderful place !
the results were simply yum !
because it is not a thai restaurant !
it is a pretty small restaurant .
they have a ton of wells fargo atms here .
it did n't even smell like pizza .
"delicious food , beautiful atmosphere and very friendly staff ."
stay away from this sushi joint !
"our wedding coordinator , <UNK> , was awesome ."
i love this place .
do get there early .
"yeah , we were dead wrong ."
i love this place !
staff not so good .
and this happens every time !
everything was pretty mediocre .
the atmosphere was another aspect that i loved .
i ' ll be back again .

* hamachi kama - it was fresh fish .
"great pizza , great experience !"
darn those lazy b * <UNK> and their brats !

loved the public market atmosphere .
"al , the sushi <UNK> is just absolutely wonderful !"
what a fantastic shop !
we ordered other food but it was n't spectacular .

a bit of a disappointment .
i could not have been happier with my experience .
especially for those fans out there .
would like to see this show again !
especially during my lunch hour at work .
he does n't like to be touched .
we were her for lunch on 0/00 / 00 .
overall a pretty decent lunch spot .
very clean with smiling waitstaff .
"the staff was helpful , friendly and respectful ."
give it a try !
had the fiesta colada .
and it is doggie welcome !
there was a live band the night i went .
overall we were really disappointed with our experience here .
these pancakes are seriously amazing .
never going to this location again !
this is not really a kid friendly place .
im going again today .
they are that good !
makes for a real anxious shower experience .
"food was cold and dry , duh !"
the sides were also great !
the food portions are huge and seem wasteful .
very convenient since that was our next stop !
i did like their bread though .
definitely order those if you go .
chili edamame is yummy too .
now a not about the chicken and waffles .
i love the <UNK> sauce .
the service was great & friendly .

i will definitely head over there again .
its totally worth the wait .
"it ' s <UNK> , too !"
will never have a better steak !
what did security do ?
"he is very professional , courteous and prompt ."
they need to make their servings bigger too .
i absolutely love this restaurant .
you get 0 per order .
"for me , the vegetable soondubu hit the spot !"
"lol no line when we arrived , but busy ."
"as well , it ' s connected to venetian ."
the chicken wings and garlic edamame are the best .
however i do n't like it much .
"decor is kitschy , but in a good way ."
every wednesday a tasting menu is offered .
i expected much more for the price .
so make sure you bring your own !
i could eat one everyday .
i was able to try a little bite .
. and telling her that she would love it .
"huge , east coast slices , too ."
. it ' s vegas .
i am actually quite impressed with this location .
the girls behind the counter were warm and friendly .
will be back and make up for lost time !

i always stop here when im at town square .
"btw , the bread basket looked pretty amazing ."

the food was good .
we made it there by 0:00 .
the cheese was nice and gooey .
we will be back !
best walmart i ever shopped at .

one of the best massages i ever had .
a thousand dollars for one year unlimited .

do not expect happy fuzzy care from your server .
"if you know any children , bring them here ."

i was so good !
it has so many great options .
it would be perfect for coming after partying .
and they are so slow !
i was n't totally impressed .

my guy friends ended up saving $ 00 .

we had dinner here valentines night .
"for drinks , we both had vanilla hazelnut coffee ."
<UNK> was my favorite .
shows up on time and works hard !
natalie h ' s zumba class is the best !
i would have to agree with the first reviewer !
this place was ok .
i would have preferred a healthier lighter selection .
"full breakfast , and the cajun shrimp omelet ."
so much to chose from .
i was stuffed and happy .
such a unique and fun experience !
<UNK> ' s is carry-out and delivery only .
that would never happen in nyc .
he said they are expired !
are n't u a part of the cosmopolitan ?
our 00 person rehearsal dinner at <UNK> was wonderful !
! they were hard and dried out .
the cucumber raita was just the right touch .
you most likely cant afford shopping here .
but that they would eventually have 00 .
love how delicate and moist it is .
i enjoyed the pizza .
i found the vdara to be simply wonderful !
we did n't order thin .
finally found the secret pizza spot !
he said medium rare is rare !
they almost looked homemade .
a couple groups and about 00 tv ' s .
"so , we entered from the back ."
and he enjoyed two glasses of harp .
they pretty much are a wannabe sugar factory .
to come back tomorrow .
you have to check it out !
this place is tasty !
this is my new favorite mexican place .
the food was a little too <UNK> for me .
we will be back !
give this place a try !
feels like a little bit of hawaii !
i would not recommend for private dinner .
we paid $ 00 / person .
"also , try their tempura veggies and shrimp ."
we love the hawaiian pizza .
"so , need i say anymore ?"
' ' it was so rude .
made my day : c - rrb -
thought i would try it .
she practically rushed us out of the restaurant .
they were not open .
we ca n't wait to go back there !
the price was very reasonable .
"for me , they ' ve gotten worse ."
i would definitely recommend this restaurant to others !
the service was super friendly and accommodating .
we will definitely be back !
the music was <UNK> trance .
the white chocolate bastard is to die for .

then again i am biased .
round 0 of the complimentary wine & appetizer tastings .
"not chewy , not tough but hard ."
i took excellent pictures !
"i love osso bucco , even pork ."
i like my soap red and spicy .
they promote themselves as being gmo free .
anything with turkey and avacado is my weakness .
husband ' s steak and potato was the same .
"upstairs was good , but a little sad ."
eat out on the patio if you can .
a definite must try !
. it ' s like a subway for pizza .
all they did was offer a first aid kit .
i ' ll never learn .
i highly recommend stopping at earls .
i go too much now !

quite simply a brilliant lunch out .
lol this place is a must !
it was definitely more about dancing and the music .
they gave us hard bread .
the guy making it was pretty awesome too !
you can tell the meat is quality and fresh !
. but its worth the splurge .
do n't think i would go again .
i ordered the kung pao chicken over steamed rice .

good drink specials every day of the week .
the food was okay .
"now , the cafeteria ... ."
my boyfriend and i are in love with you .
watch the trolley past by .
"the yellowtail was soggy , warm and fatty ."
the pickled carrots / radish were to die for !

"one thing to remember here , sharing is caring ."

the acrobatic couple at the end was particularly breathtaking .
one of our favorite spots for sure .
"plus , the location is prime ."
i love the cozy island decor .

from the sounds to the lighting to the aquariums .
the portion size is pretty small for the price .
' ' she seated us in the lunch area .
"i like the tshirts , too * g * ."
this dish was amazing .
do n't get the salmon or tuna steak .
i felt like i overpaid .

but the salads are small and not very innovative .
saturday night ... we got here about 00:00 .
hubby went with his standard omelet .
the fish was fresh and the service was fine .
the nachos were disgusting .
plates are boring 0 .
love outside boot camp .
where there ' s one there is more .
we were recommended this hotel by a local .
we were excited to try this type of dining .
it did not win me over .
my first trip to vegas .
what a great little gem !
i came here halloween night for my birthday dinner .
it ' s beautiful inside and smells terrific .
apparently the waitress was down stairs serving as well .
there was a steady flow of customers as well .
two dishes per person was enough for us .
but the best part is chelsea !
i had the chicken club sandwich .
it was all really good .
"fine dining , ok , but not here ."
you pick your own seat and basically get started .
but the line was cut off .
i went at around 0: 00 pm ?
is it the same ?
at the sight of the steamy dumplings ?
"things may seem ordinary , but trust me ."
i like this club better than xs .
"very expensive , but definitely worth the price ."
. which is n't too spicy .
first they delivered this garlic spread with fresh bread .
this place is absolutely amazing !
i like both the steak and chicken .
this was my first experience with ethiopian food .
i really like the strawberry lemonade here !
"geez , did i do something wrong ?"
"she was not rude , but not pleasant either ."
. but i was not a fan .
they responded to all of our requests very quickly .
ps - did i mention it ' s cheap ?
the drinks are about $ 00 a pop .
"at times , too sweet ."
my bf got carne asada for 00 .
i ' m sure i will be back soon .
we got in free - lrb - nice !
all of which were very delicious !
the service was <UNK> and slow .
the staff : like family .
i ' ll definitely be back .
the atmosphere is very chill including the people .
i was surprised how much i liked this place .
they need one of these in summerlin !
. i miss <UNK> !
the desserts are to die for .
"fresh food , always good ."
definitely will be coming back !
hubby had the tacos al pastor .
loved the lemon chicken soup and lamb souvlaki .
he was friendly and personable .
this time they left long hairs .
the minestrone was the best i have ever had .
the pot roast has been my favorite .
kid friendly and the staff is awesome .
thank you veronica great service !
sure enough i was over charged .
oh how i hate this place .
"however , once inside everything seemed to run smoothly ."
pricing and portion size is also really great .
it needs a little kick to it .
very accommodating and friendly .
0 - rrb - good beer and cocktail selection .
the piano players were really great and very funny .
the pasta was surprisingly delicious !
she was very sweet and understanding .
"today i did , and it was great !"
i have never received worse customer service .
but ca n't use them when i want .
make sure to eat everything if you come here .
will probably go back for drinks and apps !
the triage nurses were so nice and comforting .
hubby had coleslaw which was overdressed .
i was very impressed with the tiramisu .
fried pickles are my favorite there .
and it was dark .
it was am amazing time !
this place was packed !
i do n't know how people keep coming here .
we ' d be back to purchase growlers .
flauta plate was also good .
i love the black orchid ahi tuna .
"<UNK> is , without fail , friendly and attentive ."
. well first the hostess was n't so pleasant .
but this was just ridiculous .
i ca n't go here without getting them .
somehow a whole sandwich seemed more filling to me .
oh my ... the room was amazing !
their carne asada is ridiculous .
kudos to bc for making / baking everything fresh .
i was strangely nicely surprised .
the chicken cordon blu schnitzel is wonderful .
delicious ... serving sizes are ridiculously huge .
the side of mashed potatoes was <UNK> lumpy !
he hates your crappy emo <UNK> anyway .
the portions are also extremely generous for the price .
would n't recommend anymore .
it was both sweet and spicy .
the menu is extensive .
the food is absolutely delicious .
it also was not tour like at all .
they do have good prices and good salsa bar !
0 pizzas in one night for 0 people ?
"- lrb - though , they were very small ."
by the 0rd day i was starving .
"the atmosphere is upscale , classy and dimly lit ."
so i payed out of pocket .
so is their seafood bowl and their ragoons .
i had the <UNK> wrap .
how to properly care for my new hair style .
this place has won my heart with mexican food !
my new favorite southpark lunch spot !
i wish they would do something with the patio .
hmmm not a good sign i thought .
took him forever to give us our desert .
drinks are tasty and reasonably priced in my opinion .
great nite and delish food !
i love their service !
give them a call !
they tasted good too which is rarely the case .
". just , <UNK> complicated ."
"horrible food , horrible service ."
i would come back here just for that ... !
today was the last straw .
"not irritating , but just very noticeable ."
and the bed was comfortable .
the massage was just ok .
my husband had to rely on their twitter feed .
surely there was more !
but they said no !
i just wish they were n't so far away !
decently priced huge portions !
it was not appetizing at all .
i dont even remember the other pastries .

i ca n't wait to try their pizza !
what was so special about the holiday prices ?
it was pretty tasty but definitely pricey .
she hardly ate any fries .
it ' s $ 00 / person / hour .
no shake on the trip !
people need to be warned about her behavior .
it was the favorite among the group .
"deadly , but totally worth it !"
they have live music nightly as well !
. unless you tease him with your gyro .
i got the fish & chips ... delicious !
the only downside is that the service is spotty .
thank god i did !
' ' husband : ` ` huh ?
cold stones is a great place .
the music was great and the vibe was good .
the lines can get really long .
this shop is amazing .

love affair for sure .
the ratio of each ingredient was perfect too .
. and he actually chuckled .
always good fresh and fast !
i have been a faithful customer for 00 years .
this place is great !
i was pretty <UNK> about that cool feature .
i love their chicken fingers and their sauce .
"no , literally , i love them ."
i could n't imagine not going to her .
once we ordered small plates and wine .
i could n't have asked <UNK> better experience .
i so want to be invited into there !
the place was crowded but she seemed overwhelmed .
i have tasted better .
he also canceled one of my windows .
so beware of the photo <UNK> at the museum !
do n't waste your time by totally feeling <UNK> .
huge plates of really cheap filling food .
the salt amd pepper wings were bland .

"it is a simple , delicious , <UNK> choice ."

what happened to professionalism ?
all i can say is wow !
would i go back .
we went to complain and they said too bad .
we had a really good time !
it was a casual dinner with friends .
felt compelled to share .
especially with <UNK> money ! ! !
you can definitely share even the lunch portions .
time to relax for a massage !
so on to the cioppino .
expect to wait in line wherever you go .
i will absolutely never go to this location again .
my new favorite place !
we have busy lives we trying to return to .
i ' m glad i tried this out .
wayne loved his <UNK> burger .
had a beautiful custom piece made for a gift .
"which had <UNK> cheese , spinach , and pancetta ."
it tasted like a little bit of heaven .
it was not deserved .
my kids absolutely love it !
i would recommend you try it out !
i did n't finish any of them .
fifth or sixth time to see the secret garden .
the trainers are very encouraging and personable .
she would just be walking around .
felt like an <UNK> !
. it was delicious !
<UNK> : this place is small and cozy .
great customer service here both times i went .
"funny and inexpensive , worthy to check out !"
dessert : we both ordered the chocolate soufflã © .
i absolutely love the music they play .
i ordered the breakfast grilled cheese sandwich .
so of course i also donate to them .
there are no discounts on seafood night for children .
- dover sole : this thing was <UNK> !
there are some beautiful paintings in the suite too .
i highly recommend it .
our servers rob and heidi were fantastic .
waiting 00-00 minutes is ridiculous .
"also , very very spicy ."
"it was really , really good ."
"0: 00 , doors did n't open ."
"chuck the cook makes perfect , crispy hashbrowns everytime !"
the owner and staff are great too .
you obviously ate it though .
i ' m so glad and happy for them .
their food has heart and soul .
the shower was decent and clean .
just my two cents !
the sink was inside of the bathroom - <UNK> !
price seems ok for such a nice restaurant .
my michigan friend had the jerk chicken .
they also have a good variety of toppings .
well then comes my wedding day .
what a wonderful dish .
i do believe they had gluten-free options as well !
the interior is very welcoming and bright .
not worth your money or your time .
"our server , jennifer , was great ."
very happy with our purchase !
"a little pricey , but worth the buck ."
they make everything fresh .
its too loud and too hot .
it ' s just all so good !
they have a facebook page with coupons .
everyone was very helpful and nice to make suggestions .
fries were just ok .
"nicely priced , too ."
"goodbye , healthy meal ; hello , cheat meal !"
i will for sure be returning for future grooming .
"to my knowledge , this is the only ."
one plus was they cleared your finished plates quickly .
"it was pretty uncomfortable , eek ."
the only thing lacking was the service .
this review is about the bubble tea only !
i was in heaven !
"terrible food , horrible wine and extremely rude staff ."
and the staff is always super friendly .
"meanwhile , we still did n't get ketchup ."
i ordered delivery from grub hub .
i was charged $ 000 for each night .
- lrb - i ' m from new york .
my dad got the shrimp and grits .
had a 0 bedroom 0 bath suite .
0 skimpy sandwiches that totaled $ 00.00 without tip .
get a package and you save lots !
it ' s ... just ... not that good .
my friends liked their mediterranean salad as well .
- rrb - and some very tasty onion bread .
i tried to call 00 hour in advance ... .
the service was not the friendliest .
it was that delicious .
i was so thrilled .
this is very inconvenient .
yay for orange tree !
that disgusting strong malibu taste ?
they come in sliders and in a burger form .
i love road redesign into the airport .
we always have <UNK> as our server .
. einstein has tasty bagels and <UNK> .
the food here is amazing !
i highly suggest pickup over delivery .
"the texture , appearance - it was all delicious !"
we were able to snag a table pretty fast .
the pineapple was delicious ... mmmm ... pineapple .
not impressed by the food .
everything is freshly prepared and made infront of you .
they just keep stepping it up .
and the orange blossom tea was very good .
i really like it here .
we were assured the smoothie would come out soon .
wish i could give less than 0 star .
you gave me the wrong copy .
definitely worth the $ 00.00 !
you will not be disappointed .
try the garlic knots .
"anyway , so yes ."
this restaurant is absolutely terrible .
ca n't wait to have a picnic here !
"also , the cornbread was very tasty !"
"very accommodating , and friendly staff too ."
where can i start ... .
really outstanding and generously sized pieces of it too .
my favorite chef at the oyster bar is bob .
he also brought basil flavored <UNK> .
i ordered the spicy burger .
are you kidding me ?
i like the pineapple jam and <UNK> cream .
the chicken taco was my favorite .
came here for breakfast .
our waiter left everything to be desired .
i love the little caramel chocolate cup things .
pros : some of the classes are great !
a really nice soul food place .
i love the all you can eat .
and i really did my research !
every roll i ' ve tried is amazing !
' ' it was really mild .
nothing like it in vegas really .
we will definitely be return customers .
everything was chopped up and mixed to perfection .
"goodbye drinks on the table , hello mess ."
i highly recommend the cheesy bread as well .
getting to know the other patrons has been fun !
the crepes are delicious !
"<UNK> $ 0 , fries $ 00 ."
let the waitress call you <UNK> and sweetie .
. but trust me .
here they will get prizes for every game attended .
i got a veggie omelet .
we need to keep a comedy club downtown .
it ' s chunky and seasoned just right .
"needless to say , we killed all of it ."
really good hidden find in downtown phoenix .
the fragrance from the flowers was amazing !
"if you want a fun place , go !"
everything here i ' ve tried is delicious !
erik is an awesome waiter .
"quaint , yummy & <UNK> !"
that should have been a red flag .
they do n't have that on the menu anymore .
never forget taco tuesdays !
several items were priced at $ 0 each .
the bathrooms in this place is terrifying .
i go to this gym 0-0 days a week .
great work and they listen .
i have to say though that <UNK> !
their ribeye steak was way yummier than bouchon upstairs !
tao beach more so .
"kind of ridiculous , actually ."
"love , love , love this place ."
babaganoush was pretty decent .
love that it ' s here !
the only addition needed on the garlic was salt .
came with 0 eggs and 0 slices of bacon .
the food came out piping hot .
lots of shiny stuff .
we could n't help but start laughing then .
love love love this place .
nice and friendly teachers .
maybe they ' re just soft spoken .
i actually really like this airport .
location is easy to find .
worst service ever ! ! ! not going back .
it seemed to work out just fine for us .
this used to be my favorite hotel in vegas .
and i gave it to her .
i had the grilled cheese with tomato .
the salsa had good flavor to it .
they should never even have been open yet .
please do not trust your body with this <UNK> .
"a bit of a bummer , but oh well ."
croque monsieur was quite delicious .
"thank you , happy foot !"
the lighting outside is not good .
i really like the pear cider though .
the patty was so juicy ... perfect !
very glad we ended up here .
veggie panini was standard .
we had a team meeting here .
unimpressive ! ! i had an appt .
this place was aight .
sooo wonderful and made us wanting more .
the knots were amazing and the calzone rocked !
"i will definitely be back , probably later this week"
i am very unhappy .
"and , i need to mention this ."
i also tried their peppermint mocha .
only suggestion i would have .
"portions are huge , quality is like diner food ."
my fave was the brenner sliders .
nice clean and organized store ... friendly staff !
. yummy great bagels !
and for $ 0 ?
i want to go back to try something else .
<UNK> - this was sweet and tasty .
bottomless mimosas ca n't go wrong
the milk tea itself was way too sweet .
very friendly young male server .
our orders were wrong .
the casino is so <UNK> too .
we were seated and waited on quickly .
they had to fix her replacement food to go .
. not use to that .
"the staff is friendly , atmosphere is nice ."
i had the grilled salmon belly and pork belly .
however dr . b completely changed that !
at this point am upgrading this through my lawyer .
this place is my own personal <UNK> heaven .
"cross your fingers , bitches !"
staff was nice but not nothing special .
"crispy outside , juicy inside ."
it was honestly nothing special .
"decent , yes , and definitely try the oatmeal ."
all in all i am so happy .
"watch out , though !"
i have two complaints .
awesome brunch spot in downtown .
did i mention the <UNK> covered quesadillas ?
not massive and overwhelming .
i wish i was so lucky .
"soft , chewy , creamy , perfect ."
there was a lot of crab to go around .
then he told us we needed cocktails .
the service was just right .
he responds $ 0.00 .
they also finished the entire treat bag as well .
overall we enjoyed it !
the bed was horrific !
"<UNK> but so , so good ."
"on the menu was salad , dressing and jambalaya ."
we got the <UNK> appetizer - delicious !
maybe 00 ' ' round being generous .
"i mean , adult swim twice a day ?"
only stopped in to try a macaron .
ca n't wait to try other items .
the service was excellent !
this is nothing like vegas casino buffets .
i give it 0.0 stars .
so i was not very pleased .
i will definately be back .
food was soo good .
what a great place !
they gave me lots .
"first off , the service was great !"
i paid and got our drinks no problem .
actually at times there is no wait at all .
calamari soggy and obviously cooked in old grease .
"ok , this seemed a bit pricey but reasonable ."
the food is all right .
. 00 minutes passed & still nothing .
overall great food though !
definitely the place to go !
we ' ll be back .

it was a bit over-cooked .
he pretended not to hear me .
but it was that good !

especially on weekday nights .
staff was very friendly too !
i see dr <UNK> here but not anymore .
a definite must try !
i love the <UNK> <UNK> panini .
the hostess seated me right away .
it was a huge waste of money .

it is clean and tidy .
my favorite item is the chicken & mozzarella panini .
she did the bare minimum .
good bar staff and fun music .
i am going to be completely honest .
the spicy basil has been my favorite dish .

i spent two weeks in the hospital .
our server was very kind and accommodating .
it ' s not worth it .
i really am having a hard time with this .
oh dumplings is located right in chinatown .
i decided to try breakfast .
had their shrimp po-boy and fried pickles .
both <UNK> were bland .
we ' ll be back again next year .
' ' why of course not .
it just was n't great .
only the tomatoes were sub-par .

"the burgers looked delicious too . ,"
i absolutely love this animal hospital !
the creme brulee was pretty good as well .
i love the chopped salad !
parking is lacking especially on weekends .
most delightful server we have had in a while .
* the waiting area has newspapers you can read .
"overall , they ' re alright ."
it was well worth it .
$ 00 for the 0 of us .
"shoulda learned the first time , huh ?"
he is an asset to this restaurant !
the prices are ridiculous .
no drinks to speak of .
the biscuits were dry and definitely needed some butter .
such a big variety of delicious meals to order .
"in all , it was a good experience ."
"amazing food , service and super tidy ."
sunday morning : we leave to get breakfast .
. you lost great customers and everyone we know .
we chose heineken to compliment our afternoon snack .
"and remember , pamela ' s is cash only !"
i love that their menu is colorful and seasonal .
the vegan menu is awesome !
i have always loved the porch .
and it was fairly inexpensive too .
i am totally being honest !
"also , the food was that great ."
i will not be coming back .
it was pretty good .
food was n't great either .
and i got the fountain youth smoothie .
omg ... we will definitely be back .
do n't judge me !
conclusion : not my favorite resto .
my husband had the cajun chicken sandwich .
it looked like a dead crab on a bun .
i absolutely love this restaurant .
and you pay at the computer !
bubbles always comes home looking great .
i adore thumb rings but they are never comfortable .
i get the kids meals first .
"all in all , it was a great experience ."
the cupcakes are moderately priced and really big .
but do n't be fooled !
something that we never even heard of before .
all staff are very pleasant and fast to serve .
you ca n't beat that .
our servers were pleasant and professional .
"although wired , it is free ."
too measly for the price .
"other food is pretty decent , too ."
i had the following : chicken and gravy biscuits .
we will be revisiting often .
i love this place !
staff was very helpful .
so yummy and lots of fun .
what can i say ?
i ordered plain cheese - no extras .
: - rrb - i ' m a fan !
we were disappointed heavenly !
the bartenders are professional and so friendly .
my biscuits and gravy were all right .
this buffet was pretty dreadful ... .
and our salads came out with our meals .
the chocolate tart for dessert was decadent .
i want it back .
"and of course , the coffee is absolutely delicious ."
"it was very thin , light and crispy ."
and the tomato soup ... woah !
+ and finally the price was more than reasonable .
i literally did n't know where to look first .
both of agreed we would be back !
"fast , excellent service ."
great wood fired food i just love pita jungle .
it ' s short travel time on it .
it became overpowering halfway through my meal .
the food came out quick and was delicious .
"however , the cashier was much more pleasant ."
"there was some takeout activity , but not much ."
i ' m here once a week .
i really wanted to like this local place .
the nuts are always fab .
the place is so cute .
they refused to accept blame .
i do n't understand how this creates a problem .
"when i ' m sick , i crave shakes ."
love that it ' s in container park .
"again , i asked why it was offered online ."
i highly recommend this place !
. the list goes on and on .
this is the worst service .
but sometimes i ca n't help myself !
and i do mean anyone .
"however , they have always been overpriced ."
we enjoyed every bite .
the restaurant was super clean and well kept .
i felt it was also overpriced .
. this is an another <UNK> spot for me .
he got the pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw .
you can easily just split one between two people .
our food came an hour after placing our order .
"oh - and she ' s cheap , too ."
i threw the mess out .
i had the halibut and it was excellent .
"note to jw , this is a health violation !"
we witnessed a bunch of people getting turned away .
i was glad we came by .
they also have a promotion on drinks !
come hungry and thirsty !
plan on ~ $ 00 per person .
wonderful and delicious crepe .
the service was n't that great .
i would give it another try .
he was super kind and apologetic .
stopped in to order a lunch to go .
there were about 0 stations on the tv .
the cosmo has always been nice to me !
what i do like is their bread .
wildfire welcomes you with open arms .
thanks for introducing me to pomegranate sangria .
the fries are fresh cut and never frozen .
i would not go anywhere else !
"the prices are decent , too ."
"yes , that ' s right - free ."
what can i say ?
"` ` oh , never mind ."
went there friday night .
. the show is 0.0 hr with no intermission .
all delicious especially the gnocchi .
the best effing drink i have ever had .
our a / c did n't work at all .
chips are crispy and they give you plenty .
"ya , it was that gross ."
the spring rolls were just dripping with grease .
would definitely go back .
so many cold and frothy options !
they do n't answer their phone calls either .
"great atmosphere , great food and amazing drinks ."
no air conditioning this morning - house 00 degrees .
i wish i lived closer !
we sent it back .
it just fell apart .
that was a great show !
the crepes at this place were delicious .
i found exactly what i was looking for .
do n't waste your money on this place
anyone who combines gelato and wine is a genius .
"one for me , one for my friend ."
the motel itself was a great location .
everyone loved the design and thought it was adorable .
i only have 0 bridesmaids so not an issue .
it ' s always slow .
it is very stinky .
"ok , so seriously ?"
the menu is great !
it was way too greasy and salty for me .
so i tried flan .
went recently on a late diner with little sis !
and kids eat free on monday .
did this place hit the spot or what !
it was a great spot and also dog friendly .
our rather large party was seated on the patio .
my roommate and i went here tonight .
trainers are very unprofessional !
"i know , like night and day ."
i can tell this place just changed management .
"i have to say , my experience was fantastic ."
the hallways smelled like vomit .
nothing was bad but it was n't great either .
i love that it ' s an option .
extraordinary halibut - so moist and flavorful .
this place is just amazing .
i ordered the flautas and my friend got tacos .
it was a bit too salty to me .
just wait in line at deluca ' s .
"i love the salads too , very fresh ingredients ."
i guess they did n't want to be tipped .
go see this show !
i have totally <UNK> ' in love !
our server was no where to be found .
they took great care of us .
my buffalo wings with no sauce .
share with a friend .

and of course - the service was excellent !
mon ami gabi was well priced with good food .
this venue should be <UNK> .
only one was not working .
"it tasted smokey , which i enjoy ."

way too much to finish .
that lie alone <UNK> this company .

"super fun , good crowd , and great atmosphere ."
one of the best clubs in vegas !
maybe i expected too much ?
"it sounds weird , i know ."
the meat was gross .

"never in my life , yelp ."
they are over priced .
". yeah , just to relax ."
my husband had the john dory which was divine .

we really loved it !
"standard , but good ."
the menu is overwhelming and the seating is chaotic .
i like having sides with my entree .

i feel comfortable here wearing jeans or a dress .
they do an excellent job hand <UNK> their coats .
i had 0 helpings !
"hmmm , i can not get beyond that rate ."
"well , go look for it !"
one bite and i was done .
i did n't check out the bathrooms .
he was smart & had charisma .
i would recommend to family and friends .
also got the veggie wrap with hummus .
they can accommodate large groups and big crowds .
moore injury law completed everything in a few months !
it has lots of flavor .
this place is great !
our waitress was so sweet and attentive .
i felt like i was back in europe .
the food is amazing !
he <UNK> every plate before it leaves the kitchen .
"he was polite , professional , and quick ."
review for happy hour only .
she ' s lucky i was hungry .
all u can eat deals are completely worth it .
the bread was good .
"the right amount of creaminess , oh my ."
did not handle it well .
this place never disappoints .
we also ordered the lemon tart .
this place is nasty !
after much debate we ordered the turtle fondue .
the service is very fast and friendly .
i loved their hash browns and pancakes !
would not recommend coming during their lunch rush .
scoops were placed on the ice piece !
we will come back to this place .
what got me was the service !
i happened to find this place .
the rent must be wicked cheap .
we visited with our 0 children .
this is why i took a star away .
their calamari is also pretty good .
i sat there and waited and waited .
most of drs . were also amazing .
it was okay but not great .
first time trying tomato dressing and it was good .
"and also in a cold dish , a cockroach ."
this is one of my favorite stores ever !
we come here often because we live downtown .
i think i wo n't be back .
the beds were also very comfortable and clean .
most convenient stores are not .
its a cute country atmosphere .
do n't bring your baby .
i will continue to use their services .
however the food was n't great .
"wow , talk about good customer service ."
he said he has allergies .
full body massage was amazing especially for the price .
they respond to inquiries really promptly .
i am hooked on their waffles !
the service was good .
so the review from pierre is totally on-point .
enchiladas and fajitas were fresh and delicious .
we found the alley and descended into valley bar .
we eat here everytime we are in vegas .
i am sooo frustrated with this company .
we are going to become best buds .
there was n't any particular seasoning or teriyaki flavoring .
there were a few people in front of us .
superior customs service too !
i usually enjoy the thai fried rice with seafood .
we were just too hungry lazy to ask .
good and trendy modern mexican food .
i almost peed a little .
"do n't ask , just accept ."
but lauren she gave us a awesome experience !
i like it very much !
my go to with my husband on date night !
"and lastly , the service was wonderful !"
pretty boring as a main dish .
i think my favorite was the sedona gardens .
i ordered the seafood past at $ 00 .
"all in all , great place !"
nothing authentic about them .
chefs and wait staff were tentative to our requests .
one of four orders were incorrect .
the steak had frost on it .
it really is not one of my favorite activities .
would i go back ?
i could n't even eat part of my meal .
the dressing is unbelievable .
she clean my house so good .
soup salty and cold .
my advice is to call someone else !
the drinks were spot on !
thank you for changing my life .
when we discovered this restaurant it has just opened .
i should have given this shop more credit .
then they moved us into another room .
will not use again .
sadly my salad was not worth the wait .
when people come visit i love taking them here .
"love , love , love champagne brunch at <UNK> !"
the sundubu was delicious .
it ' s still miserable !
i ' d even checked out yelp .
"so , this is where we ended up ."
nothing like oysters that are n't edible .
i could have lived in that thing .
the over head vents actually work .
started with the brie with apples & pears .
are n't there back doors for that ?
who would have thought !
if i can ever get a reservation ... .
this place smells like mildew constantly .
he wants to go back our first visit .
our sandwich was about $ 00.00 .
why am i so early today ?
servers were very pleasant and inviting !

drop it like it ' s hot !
i havent had a falafel that good anywhere else .

they serve pepsi products which i feel is generic .
both were delicious and seasoned well .
"' ' okay , truth time ."
do not mess up my meal or my drinks .
the crab was skinny and dry .
could eat this every day .
and the tv itself was fantastic !
any recommendations on buffets ?
"owners are rude , cash only ."
it ' s also affordable especially for happy hour .
"however , when i go during other times ."
service is ok ... .
i chose habitat for humanity .
i had the most wonderfully relaxing experience here .
i went with my husband .
we decided at 00 pm .

we will eat here again .
"guess what i was wrong , so thumbs up ."

i got lamb and only lamb .
this is our new favorite bar .

"<UNK> ' s bacon , perfect amount of everything ."
i could n't have asked for any better treatment .
the sauces were the best part !

friendly and he explains everything as you go along .
i wish they let us know too .
they had their daily specials posted on the door .
it was closed for good .
i do n't remember our servers name .
the valentine ' s menu did not disappoint .
"really , it was delicioso ."
but that is not all he did !
but he did a great job engaging the audience .
my family loves this place !
"yikes , very steep ."
the food was fresh and delicious .
two sauces to dip in - strawberry and chocolate .
this was definitely not the case .
"of course , $ 00 for a 00 oz ."
i would definitely take friends there .
"possibly , if portions get bigger and more flavorful ."
. you wouldnt venture out late at nite here .
it plays its role really really well .
stay away from this store .

"this is a horrible , horrible thrift store !"
my husband and i love this place !
all i can say ... .
i am not saying they do n't clean .
another cool thing about <UNK> is the punch bowls .

luckily i did n't get sick .
better than that was my s'mores shake .

they receive a huge recommendation from me !
it reminds me of <UNK> in chicago .
this was my favorite part of the evening .
it did show up .
our server was really sweet and attentive .
such a cool little secret .
tator tots were amongst my favorite things !
how about <UNK> for $ 0 a can ?

service was just ok .
until then it ' s a-ok for me !
disappointed first time patron here .
the <UNK> arrived hot and with more then expected !

no where near worth the price .
yum ! ! ! when i visit vegas .

"i also tried watermelon martini , very refreshing ."
. 0.0 hour wait & $ 00 good ?
this place sort of took me by surprise .

more like 0.0 stars ... .
all of it tasted super fresh .

basically it ' s green and white !
and every thing was very clean .
hence losing a star here .
i usually order steak fries or rice pilaf .
we asked for proof .
i wo n't be giving them my business anymore .
"i , however , regretted my omelet selection ."
' ' i ' m exaggerating a little .
and a salad which was just okay .
i did n't like the sauces .
i had to change doctors due to time <UNK> .
she really captured the beauty of my pregnancy !
she does what ' s best for the client .
my favorite part was the crispy onion rings .

"upon entering , we were greeted immediately and friendly ."
kevin makes perfectly playful food fit for adventurous foodies .
we fit comfortably 00 girls in a salon suite .

we had such a great experience .
i was left wanting more and more .
i felt like a kid in a candy store !
very unique atmosphere - open - lots of windows .
nobody bugged us while we shopped .
so we asked for a different brew .

our tour guide was <UNK> rocked !
"i have to say , their wings are fab !"
"and others , do n't ."
it was so soft and flavorful !

literally ` ` raw ' ' .
"sushi , the regular menu , the atmosphere ... ."

huge portions that are perfect to share .
very rude and not polite .
i love this place !
i definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone !

this place was very fresh and really yummy .
food as always the same as the other restaurants .

it was well worth the drive from tucson .
i really could n't complain with my meal .
my only regret it not taking photos .
i could n't stop eating it !
the dressing was good and not <UNK> .
here is the prescription she wrote up .
everything we tried we liked .
the table next to us even left early .
that in itself makes everything taste better .
like one of those big yogurt containers huge .
absolutely loved the broth here .
parking is atrocious and kind of confusing too .
they are so ignorant !
the pernil empanadas were tasty .
i blame the person who made them .
i will most likely return .
we waited about 00-00 min .
the name kind of led me to think that .
they will even recommend recipes .
"but once we ordered , service was great ."
i was only able to eat 0-0 bites .
"awful , i tell you , awful ."
the staff is always very friendly as well !
jungle curry was too spicy for me .
this was just plain gross .
i am very happy to have found this place !
no <UNK> approaches me .
i love the <UNK> ... .
i highly reccomend this chapel .
we would definitely recommend this restaurant .
this was the worst experience ever .

"server was kind , but had no menu knowledge ."
we ' ll definitely be back to this location !
so i asked for my fries .
this is quite a swanky place !
what awesome customer service .

try the red queen cocktail .
- rrb - and they were really good !
so yes ... yes to <UNK> .

a pretty unique restaurant for champaign .

reasonable prices and variety for lunch and sweets .
they had macaroons - lrb - yum !
"good variety , too ."
their donuts are n't overwhelmingly sweet .
especially the produce section .
the tacos looked delicious .
mcdonalds would have tasted better .
thrilled that they have a gluten free menu .
he said it was mediocre .
she did such an amazing job .
"people , including myself , run these rooms hard ."
the pita was soft and thick .
i ca n't wait to go back !
i <UNK> and had to hold my breath .
i would come back .
"oh noodlehead , how do i love thee ."
i feel the same about her staff .
"however , food had good flavor ."
we ' ll never stay here again .
offered me refills and did n't charge .
the world is your oyster !
the vampire and wet dream are still delicious .
little ones will need lots of breaks and drinks .
we ordered the rib eye and the pork chops .
i wish i could give this quarter stars .
the wait was pretty long too .
. the size of the tacos are perfect !
the food was great !
"all chocolate : strawberry , lavender , & orange ."
the restaurant is bright with plenty of natural light .
' ' this is my new home base .
never had any trouble with them or the deli .
it ' s decent for vegas ... i guess .
it was really fun .
i highly recommend phoenix appliance service .
you can only buy pictures from them .
- i learned a ton .
i ' m so glad i finally did .
i still dream about that lobster .
and it was slow .
"plus , the prices are amazing !"
i liked the pesto one the best .
the tanning booths are more current and nicer .
another thing - britney spears !
they only had 0 people working the desks .
the filet mignon was perfect .
and we wo n't be back .

"salmon skin salad , mmmmm ."

the inside has a minimalist look .
really disappointed in this place .
i ' m so glad i did !
the pond was so cool !
but it was the ultimate fail .

it ' s both annoying and entertaining .
"well done , fox restaurants ."
that was pretty cool .

everything was so good and fun spot .
"smooth , aromatic with a hint of cinnamon ."

"boy , were we pleasantly surprised !"
at first i was really impressed with the facility .
super fresh taste and quick service !

a business to help others .
"we had appetizers , they were delicious ."
yummy for my tummy !

i definitely appreciated her enthusiasm and interaction with us .
and it all worked !
ca n't wait to go back !
best part was he was extremely affordable .
the salsa was just chunks of tomato .
good wine list and great service .
we ' ll be back !

i will definitely be back .

i needed this done so no choice .
we left the restaurant feeling full and happy .
and our waitress was totally nice .

' ' i then asked for a manager .
she said we do n't do reservations .
i also had a house coffee .
all in all this store seems very disorganized .
he will take good care of you !
their food is terrible .
the rice is always moist and sticky .
the food is so so good .

i ca n't get a hold of anyone there .
"unlimited beer , wine and champagne !"
it ' s diners against <UNK> eating .

"love the the mom and pop , neighborhood vibe ."
. i could n't be happier .
dh ' s marinara sauce tasted like ragu sauce .
the owner clay is awesome too .
the macho molcajete was delish !
"or really , the non-existent line ."
also comes with a side of beans and rice .
it was completely disgusting .
- lrb - the drunk one did n't .
glad i took a picture before devouring it .
not even my drink .
bar was packed with diners and march madness fans .
every single one of them was <UNK> really good .
they installed an ice tea dispenser !
i ordered a french dip and onion rings .
we were seated immediately upon entering the restaurant .
i can not explain the pastry here .
the rock and roll is truly amazing ! !
the best way to eat them .
the drive through is always friendly and fast .
i really love living at <UNK> .
i love the accompaniments of honeycomb and truffle chutney .
there ' s plenty of free parking .
thats just my preference .
because i was not talking to children or teens .
omg ... where to start !
- rrb - and paid in cash .
"lots of areas missed , including under the beds ."
and then more stuffed peppers !
i really like the dark horse sushi .
there ' s a first for everything .
everything looked so pretty !
and she was a joy to work with !
this one is not worth the <UNK> headache .
: - rrb - food was really good .
i was very impressed with the customer service here .
their food most defiantly compliments their customer service !
"the salads were fine , nothing too exciting ."
that time we each created our own burgers .
i appreciate the good customer service .
"the waffle was so soft , but not chewy !"
"nope , no such luck ."
dessert was equally amazing with the bread pudding .
. oh just go buy her a purse !
chocolate pastries are always yummy !

two words : homemade chai .
hoping for better service the next time around !

' ' i think not !
the dim sum is decent .
the cucumber martini amazing .
hot links are a must !
there is nothing <UNK> about it .
i was hoping for more like whole shrimp .
lobster bisque is nice and creamy .
it ' s located in the palm casino .
me : ` ` do you have coffee jelly ?
the staff lately has been particularly great !
clean and up to date office and equipment .
i was so disappointed .

the patio is vacant so we sat there .
i would definitely get this again .
"overall great service , great food !"
ca n't beat the traditional day starter .
then onto my head .
we found a great price on expedia .
still have yet to receive a call back .
"very friendly and helpful staff , too ."
they made a horrifying experience much easier to handle .
"all in all , a great experience !"
the music was perfect .
the pasta portions are pretty big .
i live in phoenix and drive to this one .
"for an appetizer , we ordered fried green tomatoes ."
this was my first time here .
"ugh , never again ."
check in was a breeze .
"i love the chicken quesadilla , something i crave !"

in my opinion this was poor customer service
the bartender gave us our drinks .
saw celine last night !
"the imperial rolls were delicious , too ."
the asu roll is the best !
i love this bakery and lunch spot .
food selection is slim .
- in a safe area .
you ca n't beat it ! !
the salad was fresh and delicious .
thumbs up for her !
omg - - worth every cent !
highly recommend their salmon kama and the sweet shrimp
first it is a sunday night ... .
wonder if this is common place with bowling alleys .
our drinks and food were prepared pretty quickly .
"the shrimp tacos , where ok ."
everyone seems to love it .
makes me wonder what happened ?
service - wonderful & friendly .
"but , the staff was amazing ."
they have an omelet station and prime rib .
the food is great service not so much .
"if you love meat , this is your place ."
giving three stars because the service was fantastic .

the food here was magnificent .
"beautiful , clean restaurant with great service ."

second experience ... terrible .
i ' ll definitely be back more often .
recently i found a cockroach in the bathroom !
was not my first choice but affordable .
i find it easier to list them : 0 .
i called the service center to voice my dissatisfaction .
"and you name it , they had it !"
the wait staff was friendly and efficient .
finally a place that comes with a salad .
the best macaroni and cheese ever .
both tacos smelled rancid and tasted old .
"i really enjoyed the mushrooms , too ."
i discovered <UNK> through a groupon .
the was my first time coming here .
a credit for a future order .
three words ... brown velvet cupcake .
i highly recommend you call in your order .

i love the chicken flautas or regular chicken tacos .
absolutely love boston pizza !
"favorite toppings are aloe and of course , boba !"
"omg awful , is all i could think of ."
we got seated within minutes .
the view is even nicer
there were cactus plants everywhere .
it looked much better than it tasted .
the food was better than i remembered .
"weird , we though ."
deciding where to stay in vegas ?
this place is fantastic !
would i be back ?
and then there ' s the pizza .
i flip it to its under side .
so many flavored and modifications .
great job curtis and <UNK> .
"okay , got it ."
the food is extra good .
i came here with my husband and kids .
i tried to pay in cash .

a bit farther but never a wait .
we ' ve found a great dr !

our server happened to be one of the owners .
i disagree with darren .
yo rita ' s is just <UNK> !
even tiny pops of chocolate and marshmallow .

"but , the pig wing ."
the price is great too .
they do not feed our little doggie at all .
the iced green tea is amazing !

all in all service has been friendly .
"i said no , but still ate like always !"
they also serve lunch after 00am .
super love their tikka masala fries .
note : this is only a late night offer .
the dungeness on the other hand was perfection .
the drinks are good ' n strong .
the atmosphere however is very awkward .
dress / atmosphere is very casual .
a locally owned business that cares for their customers .
in fact it ' s my favourite in edinburgh .
the lines for bbq were like 00 people long .
not the most appetizing thing .
i was in love .
so with that we wo n't be back again .
". cookies , etc . ."
i tried the chow mein noodles - yuck !
"but you know , walk around ."
i want to eat here everyday now !
i will recommend them to everyone i know !
i was <UNK> my traditional packed lunch 0 .
i know we ' ve all had it .
the waffles were crispy and yum .
love having another fantastic dining option .
the crab itself did n't have much flavor .
chairs are cushioned and comfortable .

casino here leaves something to be desired .
i loved the kentucky fried chicken !

it is free and educational .
can anyone else confirm ?
they will tell you what ' s most popular .
did n't have enough of the tanginess .
this is the place for that !
you will not get in .
was a fan of the boca park location .
i ' m looking forward to going again .
young kids that hate their life .
not going back for brunch .
i lovely cocktail bar hidden in st stephen street .

all in all it was ok .
decor was very nice .
the steak in our steak salad was <UNK> !

i was in and out in like 00 minutes !
staff were also very friendly and helpful .
0 - sometimes the music is annoying .
but the desserts were delicious .
now their customer service is horrible .
will be going back !
i would come back and try their other sandwiches .
i talk about how much i hate sandwiches .
00th is doughnut became my guilty pleasure !
the noodle dishes are an embarrassment to the chinese .
they are to die for .
great service as well !
the decor was very chocolatey !
who eats noodles for dinner ?
"great service , they are always friendly and polite ."
i was really impressed !
i was over it .
0 stars for the guacamole alone .
it was just okay .
i ' m sure i will go again .
i especially loved the pickled carrots and onions .
we absolutely love the wings at <UNK> !
they served my drink at my table shortly after .
00 minutes waiting and nothing .
my husband still has not made his connection ... .
"great food , atmosphere , and booze !"
i will be back to try something new !
flavorful & melted in my mouth .
they changed our pans twice which was just unnecessary .
i loved the modern decor .
he took her order and walked off .
they have a sitting area and great big bar .
about 00 minutes ago ... .
we will keep coming back !
does it get any better than that ?
chips and trio of salsa - - yum .
both she said was pretty good .
good food + good music = yay !
our server was amazing .
we wo n't be going back .
the room was gorgeous and spacious .
but it ' s a bit depressing .
the atmosphere was very relaxed and quite romantic .
we ate here while visiting montreal .
red for no meat and green for meat !
it ' s a great store .
not a good <UNK> .
what ' s not to love ?
it was extremely flavorful and very rich .
i adore this store .

no sorting through the sheets to find your teams .
he is a super friendly guy .
one of our favorite places to eat .
"very nice shop , modern , nicely displayed products ."
prices are amazing for the portions .
the room was nice too !
<UNK> in monta is too salty for my palate .
"- lrb - okay , maybe even higher ."
she left the restaurant completely .
<UNK> has the best spicy pork tacos !
overall great experience really .
"broth was very sweet , and pretty gross ."
nice and convenient location for my busy life .
beautiful 0 year smash cake photos !
here are our orders : 0 .
neither of us liked our food .
all the supplies are fully stocked and easily accessible .
we could n't check-in until 0 pm .
disgusting and sent it back .
go there with some friends and check it out !
i love <UNK> bbq .
there are tables / booths outside surrounding the area .
i do n't normally go for processed foods .
i am not a fan .
maybe they should taste them !
the servers are always attentive and fun .
we were greeted right away .
so we saved it for our last night .
i got the biscuits and gravy .
get a <UNK> too .
i ' ll be back !
i ' m a big fan of planet hollywood !
the rooms are spacious .
he has the best prices of anyone !

there were lots of people horseback riding as well .
you could spend hours just looking at that !
i really like rubios .
"staff is awesome , drinks are amazing ."
i do n't recommend this place at all .
the cupcakes are fairly decent as well .
very happy with my birthday cake .
loved their sweet potato fries .

we will definitely be staying again !
we come here regularly .
sea bass melts in your mouth .

our visit just kept going downhill from there .
there were so many options to choose from !
thank you again for great food and service !
the chocolate malted crunch was stale and old .

plus their soups kick @user .
"crazy , i know ."

the lobster risotto was divine .
not impressed at all .

all i wanted was answers .
i can taste the avocado .
do n't believe the hype !
very pleased customer and doggy mommy i am .
my standards were raised .

lots of varieties so i was set !
please do not see this vet .
i really love their pad thai .
hotel was beautiful and the common areas are amazing .
it tasted like plain buttered white rice to me .
their fries were also overcooked and burnt .
the whole audience laughed .
it ' s a salty yogurt drink .
i ' m glad we did !
"the lights , actors , set everything ."
everything we ordered was delicious .
first time went for dinner .

she was clearly annoyed with me .
this location always gets the order correct .

ca n't wait to go back .
it was phenomenal though .
our table had no bbq sauce either ... .
i love sushi kee !
very pleased with the delightful tastes .

i love lush products .
we were all first time customers .
all the workers are very friendly as well .
it ' s a wonderful flavor profile .
one day i will try something different .
i enjoyed the gourmet <UNK> to the menu .
the fish fry was over cooked and blah .
great drinks and bartenders are really nice !
the bulgogi burritos are a must !
it is well stocked and always fresh .
they always blame it on a new cook .
i will not support this location anymore .
i also had to wait for lettuce .
happy with my stay - thank you !
service was peppy and good as usual .
ca n't say anything more than that .
i was really disappointed by the food here .

hopefully the manager of this store is aware ... .
. it was all too rich and sweet .
"overall , i think this place is overpriced ."
so both cakes were only $ 0 - something .
they completely ignored us .
the <UNK> meal is fabulous and affordable .
everything we had was amazing !
familiar with the word doner ?
the staff are always friendly .
went for lunch with my husband .
sierra turkey - very dry .
and it was <UNK> .
i even gave them a second chance today .
both us really enjoyed our meals a lot !
service in both was impeccable .
five stamps = a free meal .
this harkins is okay .
"quick , friendly and attentive ."
i recommend bell trans and would use them again .
the crab legs were also surprisingly flavorful .
ca n't wait to do it again !
i will definitely be returning !
the place is kept very clean .
definitely lives up to the hype .
. or order after having a few drinks .
best meal i ' ve ever had while visiting .
"she was reliable , fast and efficient ."
they easily accommodate larger groups .
do n't expect chips and salsa .
so that was good .
"omg , this place is amazing !"
thank you for the rushed lunch and stomach ache .
the burgers are a perfect size for one person .
"with two people , it was extremely filling ."
the brussels sprout petals were lovely .
i do n't recommend this place at all .

", ' ' my friend asks ."
"service is excellent , our server was jose ."
he did not push me towards unnecessary services .
i was also worried there would be nothing vegetarian .
it was also big more than enough for two .
yes i totally would .
the room was clean and the staff was friendly .
the boba was so soft which is my favorite !
there are better chinese food places in c-u .

i think it ' s worth the wait .
do n't waste your time .
"bartender robert was awesome , and in <UNK> ."
"it ' s clean , spacious and safe ."
do n't waste your money .

holly at day break was fabulous !
. yuck ... yuck .
she only gave us 0 menu .
ask for rachel ... she ' s the best !
i promise i will not be using it again .
bartender <UNK> poured us some cocktails .
there are no clubs like the ones in vegas .
stopped in today after reading yelp reviews .
my husband and i are locals .
honestly the best bakery in town !
"next , chicken <UNK> ."
so far so good no complaints .
huge portions for the price .

tyler was accommodating and pleasant .
the coffee milk is sweet and just strong enough .
"clean , cheap room for a nights rest ."
the sales associate said they would call me .
the food was exceptional and authentic to me .
"the bathrooms , not so clean ."

so many <UNK> options !
i will not be searching for a different office .

it was so freaking good !
bathrooms are clean and everywhere .
def the best hotel on the strip .
so far i ' m loving it !
great good and great service !
the server was super nice .
my experience with sonoran suites was wonderful .
they were small but absolutely perfect .
there was no parking out front .
a jukebox plays records .
the passionfruit tea was refreshing and comes unsweetened .
the meat section ... very dry and overcooked .
i also ordered a house margarita .
i expected it to be loud .
it came up to $ 00 .
i opted for the traditional <UNK> stew with chicken .
but the bathroom was very small !
then homemade baklava to top it all off .
too much meat for him .
this is my favorite one so far .
tao beach is sooooo small !
no veggies on these babies .
the atmosphere is quaint also .
rare for my husband and medium rare for me .
do not buy on site from these people !
what a burst of flavors !
i normally would try to be understanding of things .
love them ! ! ! this place is great !
bonus fireworks superstore in the same parking lot .
"it was a good salad , the <UNK> one ."
"oh , not toothpaste to use with my toothbrush ."
orange juice tasted freshly squeezed .
do n't go without a coupon .
i do n't need to go anywhere else .
the desserts were good too .
give it a try !
the free breakfast is amazing .
in a matter of minutes .
i went with a cheese & pesto pizza .
i do n't get it .
been going there for years .
nothing tasted like nutella or chocolate or was sweet .
he seemed to like it .
it was tender and flavorful .
i was kind of disappointed .
so thanks for the baby burrito .
hot and fresh each time .
"wonderful people , wonderful atmosphere and wonderfully vegan ."
"luckily , i can still write !"
i absolutely adore this place !
enjoyed my first and only visit .

thanks phoenix <UNK> ' s !
"they were smoky , flavorful , and so delicious ."
"the eggs were , well , deviled eggs ."
and i never say that !
he went above and beyond .
i ' m so happy with this place .
"never got an apology from him , nothing ."
they also have live music most days .
portions were larger than i expected for the price !
it will be a new work favorite for sure !
but the food was good .
he responded oh a taxi ?
the rest of the curry tasted like melted mustard .
"we ordered appetizers , the spinach dip , nachos ."
this place is seriously good .
fun grand canyon day trip .
real boring as well .
"my friends beer , $ 0 ."
they have $ 0 jello shots too !
we would come again .
it was loaded with bacon and sour cream .
cam : gnocchi with chicken .
i wanted to like this .
it is lightly doused with mango puree .
firefly lived up to every review .
anyway their tuna here is perfect .
this is our favorite pizza place in ballantyne .
there is constantly confetti falling .
i love primanti ' s sandwiches .
i love love love their cookies and <UNK> cakes .

"great neighborhood atmosphere , kid friendly place ."
. their wings & pizza are sooooo good .

and have yummy drinks .
bugs just do n't happen .
it ' s very reasonably priced .
my chicken madrid was excellent .

i was way more impressed with <UNK> ' s !
i ' ve been to this location many times .
it was too much .
it ' s all good .
the service was good .
' ' nothing to write home about .
i look forward to going back !

we were glad we tried it .
i also really enjoyed the rice .

i also got a can of fanta .
great customer service <UNK> <UNK> .
"pretzel cone , omg !"
the wild orchid : subtly fruity but strong .
extremely fresh baguettes and vegetables to accompany the sandwich .

"portion size is good , always leave full !"
i would highly recommend freddy and appreciate his help !
excellent meal here for our group of four ladies .
thanks for a good time !
"sure , the food takes a little longer ."
i have eaten there and taken it to-go .
good mall for walking .
and all for only 0.00 !
produce did not look that fresh .
my friend said the damage has been done .
the mac and cheese was meh .
definitely will be going back .
you just have to come and try for yourselves .
i wo n't try this place again .
excellent customer service and environment .
but she went the extra mile .
"they are actually decent wines , too !"
you got ta be kidding me .
we will definitely be back !
but now it ' s not even close ... .
my employees love the cod fish and the salad .
she was a <UNK> !
"all in all , i wo n't be returning ."
they need an update badly !
"for what i paid , i found this unacceptable ."
your 0 legged friend is in great hands here !
we could n't believe it .
the eggs were perfectly cooked as were the hashbrowns .
it ' s named appropriately .
. so we got a north facing room .
"first , the appetizers ."
the food came out very quickly .
i would go back for the sausage .
really could not be happier !
has <UNK> been here ?
one of my favorite places to eat in champaign .
thought i ' d finally write a review .
this club is alright .
the situation escalated out of hand by immature workers .
i was in and out in a timely manner .
i ordered the <UNK> chicken .
this place is beautiful .
too much smoked mozz just made the crust soggy .
the bed was alright .
great with their charleston tea plantation cinnamon spice tea .
i will definitely be going back more often !
the server was super sweet .
so happy to have stopped by .
we have wanted to try this place for awhile .
we came here for their lunch specials .
i always order a dirty iced chai ... yum !
perfect amount of <UNK> and ginger .
but it ' s not a <UNK> or anything .
"okay , so i ' m cheap ."
looks great in the kitchen .
it was plenty though !
so tender and the sauce is amazing !
"the sushi , well , was a huge disappointment ."
not the way to spend your vacation at all .
i so appreciate joe and his wonderful service !
we were quite disappointed .
both pasties were great !
the staff is very friendly and quick .
the chicken curry was spicy and delicious .
i do n't know how .
i will not recommend this place to anyone .
i really enjoyed the champagne brunch .
they also have one of those 0/0 yard drinks .

and of course our favorite server penny is off .
no <UNK> or hidden agenda there .
"high quality , delicious food and delightful service ."
our service was horrible .
the staff was super helpful and friendly .

i was really tempted to leave right then .
<UNK> it was pretty reasonable .
the live musician tonight was delightful .
he said it could have waved at me .
this starbucks is right inside of macy ' s .
to start : fried spring rolls these were delicious .
the egg foo young was interesting .

express service is awesome !
never going back to this nasty place again .
$ 00 to get in the door .
when i walked in i understood why .
you will fall in love !
the room was spacious and quiet .
they literally need to <UNK> from the ground up .
but definitely ask for their pizza .
"also , the decor is really cool ."
trust me i am a nurse .
the staff was friendly and helped with recommendations .
i can see how tourists would like this place .
my boyfriend opted for the chicken ceaser salad .
i did not mind at all .
looked good to us .
super informative on the menu .
they are the best i ' ve ever seen .
i had hayden today and he was great .
best vegas clubbing experience ever !
luckily the good drinks helped the saltiness go down .
i am definitely a fan .
"overall , okay experience ."
would i like a free meal as in one ?
' ' seriously that is your response .
what : first thing ' s first ... .
"did n't get delivery , got take out ."
they have great brand name frames and contacts .
will have to come back again and try more .
their cocktails are all perfect .
i ordered my soup .
a secret pizzeria that is n't too secret anymore .
if it is n't overcooked it is very tasty .
my dog <UNK> absolutely loves it there .
but the $ 0.00 orange juice a ripoff .
so yummy and totally worth the wait .
"yes , there is such thing !"
i would definitely recommend this place !
sadly ... there were first and last .
no need to return .
we have learned our lesson .
discrimination is n't cute 0 oak .
he is kind and had no <UNK> .
a month later i ' m still craving it .
the hash browns and eggs were just as delicious .
the wrap had indian cheese also made by them .
i know i did when i was there .
cream of corn delicious .
i liked the one called sexy girl .
"blt and the earl , yummy ."
looking forward to going back sometime soon !
it just smelled like florence !
i get comments on it all the time !
it ' s a special place to us now !
the restaurant itself is nicely decorated and immaculately clean .
so what is the catch .
i probably wo n't be back .
the best service so far .
they could use a little upgrade .
"pretty simple sandwich , right ?"
pizza was as i remembered though .
the vegas vegan was a little lame .
there ' s a $ 00 - lrb - ?
the sandwiches are <UNK> in size .
well try it one more time .
our server was super nice and really helpful .
i love that i can sit outside as well .
but they offer all sorts of different grocery items .
this place was packed friday night !
they also serve nuts with your drinks .
"luckily , it was n't a big fat fail ."
i did n't finish most of it .
could not ask for better service .
i love this place !
horrible service and not worth the money .
and sadly that ' s the truth .
will i continue to go here ?
pretty much anything you can dream of !
how do you mess up ravioli ?
the red velvet pancakes were delicious .
the service was pleasant as well !
"honestly , it ' s nothing super fancy ."
most disturbing was how drinks were served ... .
the bath tub was filthy .
i wish that i had ordered that instead .
so very friendly and sweet .
the tickets were pretty cheap .
i highly recommend trying this place at least once .
happy <UNK> = happy momma .
we know how an albacore looks and taste like .
just plain rude and insulting owner !
i could eat here every day !
they were just ` ` alright ' ' .
"great food , decent drinks ."
the oriental salad with the macadamia nut chicken .
this dish alone seals me coming back .
we had to ask for them .
but the food was not good .
"sweet , sweet , sweet !"
"never again , will we shop at ashley ' s"
the tuna was very red .
that was my experience there .
i love this place !
but also because it was quite small in size .
we stayed in a new tower - paradise tower .
it was very sticky and held flavor nicely .
makes the whole experience that much more enjoyable .
kind of a damp musty smell .
we ordered the seared yellow tail salad .
he was very professional and very nice .
- rrb - love this place !
the next course was a chicken and ginger soup .
look for server named patty - she is awesome !
it was the best time and birthday ever .
will be back for more .
i love this place .
at least the drinks were yummy and strong .
staff is friendly and we were seated right away .
they have extremely odd hours .
i <UNK> out like there was no tomorrow .
had to bring it back
i also got suckered into the specials menu .
the rest of the salad bar was basic .
information i did not want to share with her .
absolutely love it here !
i ' m going back for sure .
it was plank cooked salmon with asparagus and potatoes .
the portions are great for the price !
but i will be back to give her extra .
the house salad is incredible !
their locker rooms are fabulous and second to none .
wo n't be back .
the drinks are great !
"overall , a fun place to catch dinner !"
my hubby and i enjoyed it here .
had a wonderful dining experience .
sincerely <UNK> with just the right amount of attention .
. but everyone around me was - rrb - .
the bacon was incredibly smoky .
"0 stars , not 0 because of price ."
the service was fast and very nice .
i was between a burger and the tuna melt .
this place is wonderful all around !
they have an adult pool that you can use .

my skepticism was very quickly laid to rest .
"i ordered the chicken pad thai , no shrimp ."
they do offer valet .
i will definitely return !
they have not been remodeled .
so make sure you go after 00pm on sundays .
a shiny new pizza spot !
i personally think everyone should go with the fondue !
staff is always friendly !
i ca n't wait until my next visit !
there were 0 of us .
"all is all , great spot !"
the salesman was knowledgable and friendly .
not your typical brunch place with eggs any style .
i love this restaurant !

i ' ve recommended him to everyone i know !
the food was delicious and the portions large !
dining room was clean ... we will be back .
it ' s an awesome concept !
plates range from $ 0.00 - $ 0 .
my tea arrived with no offer of sweeteners .
ca n't go wrong with sriracha sauce !
loved the portabella fries .
ambiance is a little upscale and so inviting .
all i had was a super super minor injury .
"endless reviews , and all so favorable ."
they definitely have me coming back for more .
"you can not beat these prices , even downtown ."
the theater was stunning and the music was beautiful .
came here based on all the yelp reviews .
garlic prawn fried rice - holy prawn batman !
i had not - until we got this pizza .
there is also audience participation which i liked .
only helps them to faster turnover .
probably wo n't go again .
"the pastries , do n't even get me started ."
had dinner there last night .
"we got meatball , green peppers , and onions ."
it was enough for two meals .
the mexican and chinese food were alright .

"awful , just awful customer service ! ! !"
the server was actually quite friendly and attentive .
cajun fries - still had a kick to it .
"laid back atmosphere , nice waitstaff ."
reasons being : 0 .
it goes to the owners .

my kind of place !
the continental breakfast had some nice chocolate filled pastries .
this place is always way understaffed .
garlic knots are amazing as well !
i only went down there to find the pool .

another friend got fries and it took forever .
and now for the special sandwich .
paradise makes great pasta salads and soups as well .
portion size are decent bordering the smaller end .
i had no complaints about the hotel .
definitely worth checking out : - rrb - .
would definitely come back if i lived in vegas .
to each their own i say .

"seriously , i could drink that stuff by itself ."
"three stars , really ?"
i ' m leaving on a trip tomorrow .
i also like their noodles .
do n't <UNK> me of my <UNK> ale !
"the smell alone , was reason to leave ."
"ultimately , they did a great job !"
kind of a bummer for the money !

stumbled on thus on our way to the <UNK> .
we eat here all the time .
we finally went for dinner yesterday .
i ' ll keep this short and sweet .
"happily , it did !"
i purchased a groupon for this place .
we loved local dish .
my favorite is the lemon pepper .
the ambience was open and bright .
it most definitely does matter !
but that ' s not it !
everything i ' ve tried is absolutely delicious .
i wanted another sandwich when i was finished .
great concept in need if <UNK> .
this might the sushi sleeper in henderson .
some things are just not needed ... .
it does n't smell funky either .
a car is a definite must !
my front door lock stopped working .
i will be <UNK> more soon .
they all want you to do well .
we had an excellent veggie pizza .
they need to be open 00/0 though .
it was almost 00 o'clock before our food came !
we said what the heck let ' s splurge .
the rest of the store was quiet .
he is the best !
i ordered french toast and eggs .
love this dentist and his wonderful staff !
and tasted like it .
it was absolutely amazing .
every bite was amazing .
lots of warm reds and <UNK> .
i ' ll come for more .
i am sorry but they have dropped the ball .
really feels like a <UNK> church .
and they have an outside seating area with flowers !
it was ridiculously sweet .
tons of free stuff to do !
"i , for one , was still <UNK> afterwards ."
thank you for an awesome quick meal in-n-out burger !
excellent lemon drops and wine list as well !
because here is the photo proof .
the pulled pork potato skins are amazing .
0th point : wicked board games !

the spring and egg rolls are excellent as well .
i am looking forward to coming here again !
the service was great and attentive .
actually it was pretty good .
it was worth every penny .
this vet does n't even deserve 0 star .
i always receive friendly warm service here .
definitely a place to pick up or delivery .
i highly recommend wildflower for lunch and dinner .
these guys were excellent !
it ' s stuffed with crab .
she will definitely become our family optometrist .
- lrb - i have lost so much flexibility !
food was really good and on time .
and our cat loved it .
"again , thank you so much !"
our litter of puppies had <UNK> .
food ... the warm brie is so <UNK> .
i definitely recommend the pastor on pretty much anything .
there are also two other cool stores next door .
kudos to him and his <UNK> for accommodating that .
the burgers were so overcooked and dry .
i usually try to go during off peak hours .
served with a sweet & sour sauce .
this place definitely takes you to germany .
i could not believe how terrible this show was .
"otherwise , not so much ."
the dressing was soooo good .
plus they are dog friendly .
try the cucumber soda .
we were not disappointed ; every burger was amazing .
this is a hidden gem !
it came with hush puppies & pickled onions .
she knows what she ' s doing !
we take what we can get .
everything in this sandwich tasted fresh .
"we got some garlic bread , which was alright ."
tomato sauce makes this pizza .
meh ... i was not impressed .
the food was amazing !
we were also given tickets to the breakfast buffet .
"would i go back , no ."
they have all kinds of sports bras too .
the only miss was the crab hot pot .
especially their house fried rice ! ! !
the set back is their fries typically taste old .
it ' s awesome - it ' s refreshing .
i have never had a bad experience here .
we opted for the tasting menu and wine pairings .
"still not worth the wait , food or drinks ."
still our favorite place for dinner and <UNK> !
no love for the <UNK> here .
your tastebuds will thank you .
the bowl of fruit was my favorite .
it is melt in your mouth good .
would 000 % go back just for the sausage !
we did not order dessert .
saturday i noticed someone had been in my house .
fancy schmancy way of saying upscale seafood .
overall a so-so experience .
"down to earth , honest and trustworthy business ."
* eggplant alla parmigiana - huge portion .
the portions are generous and the turnaround is fast .
first time to try it and i loved it .
the gyro was tasty .
god bless and take care
the kahlua pork sandwich is yummy too .

i am beyond stoked on my finds .
the decor is upscale chic modern .

this place is cool !
the bread is always fresh and tasty .
i liked the vibe and atmosphere of the place .

always good to ear here .
he was courteous and a safe driver .
at no time did i feel rushed or pushed .
third time i came for my birthday lunch .
i love this place !
decided to stop in for a yummy treat .
and the back patio is so peaceful and relaxing .
"i know , we have had them all ."
the food was mediocre .
. sesame chicken with white rice and crab puffs .
they seem like a high turn over in doctors .
i gave him the rest of my tea .
"maybe to eat , though ."
tried the raspberry and that was delicious .
how friggin ridiculous right ?
dressing was not overpowering .
"the restaurant was clean , however ."
"no flavor , very dry and tasted old ."
everything was incredibly salty and nothing was a stand-out .
i eat out at least 0 nights a week .
the carrots are very sweet .
"with the burger , i had sweet potato fries ."
freshly squeezed juice is on par !
that should have been the first bad indicator .
it was not pack at the time i went .
this hotel was beautiful !
worst cocktails i ' ve tasted .
i think it is a waste of money .
the food was excellent and the drinks were amazing !
"overall , a great experience ."

i also like that they serve <UNK> .
the bagel was just okay .
i highly recommend it !
dont come to this one !
they do have a conference center ready and waiting !
everything we have tried we love !
broth is pretty light so it tastes .
"toast is buttered , white bread ."
that was definitely not the case at this dealership .
i would eat here again .
my education is complete .
i also ordered a margarita which was terrible .
the best part about the sandwiches is the bread !
"i know , hard to believe ."
"regardless , the food was great !"
the cirque du soleil was great !
i will definitely be back !
that works for me !

i came here again with my boyfriend .
loved the <UNK> chicken tortilla soup .
i felt bad for them .
such amazing soul food !
$ 0 house wine !
everything on here is amazing .

get your things together and do n't false advertise .
it ' s hard to find authentic taiwanese food .
i was expecting something sweet .
they are seriously so delicious and fresh .
not willing to accommodate or admit they were wrong .
i spoke with sarah .
maybe it was because the room was huge .
i just wish it was closer to my house !
dexter loves the training treats !
the rolls with tempura shrimp were especially bland .
we never did get food .

that would have been good to know !
the hotel itself was clean and comfortable !

i love coming here and playing tourist !
ca n't wait to go back !
i know that ' s shocking .
keep driving if you can !
the side of caesar salad was pretty standard .
for the 0 of us was outrageous .

he instructed me to call the manufacturer .
i loved their sparkling homemade lemonade .

"get some <UNK> up in there , friends !"
that was exactly what i needed .
the main dance floor gets really crowded .

"ron , adam and brandon definately know their business ."
it has all the perfect ingredients you can taste .
for the ladies its free of course .
first comes with chips and three different salsas .

the fish sam was good .
the rudeness of the young boy says no .
the food is amazing .
"me : um , just normal ."

everything about this place was ehh .

the muscles were dry .
"i swear , i love this office !"

i come here often .
"very friendly staff , quick service and yummy subs !"
we might do it .

lao the cucumber martini yummy !
the food was always fresh and delicious .
the pool was awesome with a beautiful view .
the <UNK> is super small .
you also can go at your own pace .
we waited ... and waited .
"of course , i have my favorite vendors ."
it really is in the middle of nowhere .
try the corn & chicken sandwich !
it was pricey but worth the money .
definitely a must try .
. typical for high-end restaurants - rrb - .
"and it ' s very , very creepy ."
the name totally threw me off .
the waterfall pours quicker as the time goes on .
i have never even heard of something so absurd .
would i like a nicer looking menu ?

they then take the rest of the duck away .
however the restaurant menu and food quality needs tweaking .
it was a good price .
and hopefully someone <UNK> that watch !

it ' s a place .
yelpers : check in to get your free coffee !
what a great beer selection !
"every time i went , there was a line ."
this is not a california roll kind of place .

"and they send specials , discounts on services ."
nice thing was that there were two bathrooms .
omg and i never eat desserts .
it was bitter and smelly !
it smells so good inside .
nothing fancy about them .
we will gladly return .
the miso salmon was good !
the wait staff is always very friendly and helpful .

i am obviously devastated .
the stroganoff ' s gravy was yummy .
i had to ask the other lady for it .
noodles were completely tasteless .
it did n't wow me especially the service .

drinks were good but food was just okay .
all the good things kids need !
she kept pushing off any compensation for a month .

we got there earlier this time .
we got the black milk tea with honey boba .
i was extremely disappointed with our experience .
a month after i had gotten my phone .

they let us check out the second floor pool .
it was crispy and tender at the same time .
we ' ll be back !
they are all gentle and take their time .
like he completely disappeared .
"oh well , will not be returning ."
i want to go to there .
we tried almost all of the tapas .
the cocktails were original .
last night was such a great experience .
it ' s pretty ridiculous .
they also give you caramelized onions with your .
authentic mexican food indeed !

"<UNK> , $ 00.00 ?"
"why , you ask ?"

the service is good .
price and portion is on point !
it was melt in your mouth perfect .

that atmosphere is always amazing <UNK> locals and tourists .
"this place , <UNK> not so so bad !"
the bartenders were friendly and engaging .
this location has such spectacular memories for me .
and now my husband and i are hooked .
thai thai takeout made that happen for me !
i feel you should pay more attention to that .
our waiter said what would you like to order .
we have been wanting to go for awhile .
the guys behind the counter were super nice .
i also loved the guacamole .
everything tastes better when you ' re drunk .
i wo n't be going back .

it ' s slop and drop .
i ordered the lavosh shawarma wrap which was yummy .
i would definitely come back for lunch .

the live music is always a plus .
the pizza was sooooo yummy !
i hope it remains the same .
perfect for a late night sushi run !
i would not eat there again .

it took an hour to get our food .
then we each got a burger .

sadly it was not a good experience .

my personal favorite is the pineapple cider !
delicious food for cheap .
highly experienced hair stylists and reasonable prices too .
i really love this show .
they actually follow popeyes weekly tradition .

it was tasty but nothing special .
"thinking back , i should have not tipped ."
never going to this churches again .
very friendly when i called to place my order .
we ' ve made reservations for 0 o'clock .

sunday afternoon the place was packed and completely understaffed .
we placed our wine order and waited .
you wo n't regret it .

i * love * this place !
thank you for a wonderful day !
olives is vegas without feeling pretentious .
they are patient and kind .
my kids did not laugh .
and i ' m always excited to go back .
the staff was extremely rude and inconsiderate .
every thing we had was delicious !
i ended up with a pizza for dinner .
bun was 0x the size of the sausage .
we ended up switching .
but the complimentary bread we got was great .
i love coming to this salon .
"delicious burgers , hotdogs and waffle fries ."
house made mixers and syrups .
it did n't dissapoint .
great deal and the perfect amount of food .
both are fabulous options .
"oh , and you must try the banoffee pie !"
"try the jasmine cookies - interesting , <UNK> ."
i found out by taking a sip .
overrated in my opinion .
"food was good , not spectacular ."
the food is not good .
we ordered the bananas foster crepes .
we will be back !
this place is adorable !
"pasty ' s are great , even to go ."
"easy life , you have won my heart ."

loved the <UNK> and peas and rice .
` ` are you sure you ' re ok ?
they ' ll appreciate it .
everything was just good enough .
i have had several pairs of pants hemmed here .
but that ' s me .
they have to be the relatives of the owners .
would stay here again .
and ended up to going to olive garden .
friendly valet and bell desk staff .
it was neat seeing the gondolas boat past you !
he let us take our time to look around .
i ' m not mad at this place .
we waited and waited and waited .
"all bad , but <UNK> goooood ."
i asked the tech if they <UNK> their <UNK> .
"unfortunately , only dessert options are offered ."
"that right , people !"
the pumpkin pie was delicious !

the chocolate strawberry muffins are also very good .
she got the mac & cheese .
we also got tempura veggies and chicken ramen .
it was flavorful and juicy .
will definitely be back !
"i sit down to a filthy , paper menu ."
the spicy dishes are never spicy .
tried some different food not our usual .
i have been happy with all of the instructors .
they were also accommodating with respect to food allergies .
it was not a pleasant experience .
the noodles were small and tender .
other than that bravo !
will definitely be utilizing their services again .
i want to say beverly .
i would recommend him to anyone and everyone .
my new fav spot !
the food was great and very fresh .
. if he cant fix it no one can !
i loved the green chili burrito enchilada style .
i ' m so glad i found it accidentally .
"unfortunately , the food itself was nothing special ."
how could you not ?
margarita and pepperoni pizza was also just okay .
on top of that she was very friendly .
where is the luxury in that ?
the food was pretty good with so many options !
i ordered a wild boar burger instead .
"and yes , you should definitely be jealous !"
we will definitely have you back !
the ambience was chill .

amazing food with amazing service .
"fair , reasonable and polite ."

i went home and looked them up .
maybe a touch too much salt .
plenty for 0 meals !
i took my two <UNK> there last weekend .
now stop reading and just go !
reserved the regular stretch limo for a saturday night .
it just has this simple and wonderful charm .
it ' s dark and romantic with candles burning .

we had seats kind of close to the front .
"my favorite , the shrimp and crusted sirloin ."
this visit tops the cake though !
great conditioning and light <UNK> make the class awesome !
. and the fries !
also ran into the q ' s .
"a little crumbly , but it tastes yummy ."
so inside it is definitely old school .
this carbonara tasted mostly of pepper .
"the drive in is gorgeous , but time consuming ."

it was horrible for the cost .
"after that , the tour was enjoyable ."

for one bowl of soup .
it is n't pretty .

live music on certain days .
"plus , it ' s just plain healthier ."
you pay for what you get .

not too much parking either .
i got the carrot cake which was really great .
waaaay better than <UNK> ' s .
"but overall , awesome !"
"michael mina , you did it again !"
i absolutely love this place .
we had the dolce <UNK> pizza .

this is a horrible representation of a deli .
thank you mastro ' s las vegas !
faster wifi than lax .
db was great fun !
would definitely go back again and try something else .
the breakfast does n't disappoint !
a side of anything ?
i usually order a chicken caesar or salmon salad .
the food was old and tired .
stopped by this location to check it out .
but my visit was great !
we probably wo n't be back any time soon .
he also got our check asap when asked .
the fries were an odd mix .
but <UNK> has something a little different .
"on wednesday , it was absolutely amazing !"
"tick , tick , tick ."
it looks amazing when you first walk in .
it was like eating hard squid chips .
about the lentil <UNK> salad .

you must try it for yourself .
service was warm and informative .
i wish they would change this .
they were so good with them and to me !
the portion was incredibly small ... .
best affordable chinese restaurant in madison area by far !
"overall , sadly to say ."
idk why they do that .
that was really good too !
i was very impressed with their attention to detail .
having separate areas for separate dog sizes is genius .
the doctor is dreamy too .
not sure why we got a b-day cake .
i like that they serve gluten free pasta .
the sandwiches are like a foot tall .
leaving our drinks empty and grill almost empty .
it is n't a dive bar by no means .
the cheese curds were ok too .
sam came out to give us an estimate .
"overall , this an okay store ."
was he just having an off day ?
my husband was finished eating by this time .

but oh the crappy reviews everywhere .
the first time i went here was a miss .

since then the service has been <UNK> .
small selection but everything is fresh .
i love going to this place !

i ' d recommend that if anything
"while you wait , check out the grocery store !"
im glad i used it .
the tables were also nicely spread .
i also love the layout of this place .
i am absolutely in love with their baby cakes .
+ the food was great !
talk about an attitude !
the food was alright .
i had the pineapple coconut organic facial with cheryl .
the money which i paid off immediately !

"then , we got to the checkout ."
everyone needs a yummy <UNK> delicious treat sometimes .
the food is worth it !
i will be back .
haha love this place .
the chicken enchilada omelet is a fantastic choice !
the feel is quaint and romantic .
they have the best soba in vegas .
so the prices are great .
"let me tell you something , it sucked ... ."
i liked that the room was spacious .
. the low review was for the service .
really liked the contrast of spicy and sweet .
<UNK> has everything you can think of !
seats were very comfortable .
i will never go back to this place .
we eat here pretty much every weekend .
it was a cute little <UNK> aspect .
i love their potstickers !
and everything was overly salted .
"each time , i thoroughly enjoyed my purchase ."
i still ca n't believe it .
everyone who was working there seemed happy and helpful .
this is my first time here .
this store really is so fresh and so easy !
i wish i had just ordered the drink .
they just did not taste right .
my sandwich was very sloppily made .
very sweet and a mild taste of ginger .
"welcome back , dr . <UNK> !"
the staff is extremely friendly and helpful .
how about __ or ___ ?
<UNK> sullivan ' s is misleading and disappointing .
you really ca n't go wrong here .
my go to dish is the chicken quesadilla .
it was a pretty good size for $ 0 .
it was definitely delicious .
i had to get people to <UNK> with me .
nice facility to practice on the driving range !
the store pretty much just sells the shoes .
$ 00 for a plate of 0 latkes ?
siena definitely has a great selection of food .
"however , this place really needs new bartenders ."
are you kidding me ?
the show was funny as hell though .
love this local mexican place !
i am beyond disgusted with two of your officers .
i walked into changing hands and asked for it .
service was not good and food was not good .
"after our entrees , we decided to order dessert ."
i would go back in a heart beat .
i thought that was neat .
i ' ve been here twice now .
i favor the fajitas and the veggie enchiladas .
they do hold back for the girls / kids .
it looked bad and tasted terrible .
we started off with some appetizers of spicy mussels .
went there on a saturday night .
i enjoy flavor but not burning my mouth .
soft shell <UNK> good !
"he opened his head , had to get staples ."
i would definitely recommend o face doughnuts .
- lrb - definitely call ahead !
both very wonderful and filling .
we have been twice in summer .
the food and service was good but not exceptional .
the residents who injured my friend were not <UNK> .
i ordered the veal parmigiana .
i think i stick to baskin <UNK> .
0 block from the fremont street experience .

"not really necessary , but nice ."
we will be life long customers here moving forward .
general manager notified and waiting for response .
he was a huge fan !
the best part was the bill ... $ 00 !
rude servers with no attention to detail .
we came here for my friends birthday .

my favorite skit was the man in the mirror .
perfect for dining in or take out !
i like the crunchiness .
i just <UNK> do n't believe them .

i give the bar / happy hour a 0 .
this little taco shop gets 0 + stars !
i did not regret it .

"just awful customer service , really disappointing ."
they get my vote every time .

we waived down a waitress and apologized .
it took them less than 00 minutes .
"ladies , go on thursdays ."
the candles were $ 00 each + tax .
we waited for about an hour for a table .
- i ' m 000 pounds .
. but my boyfriend was a bit shocked .
it made buying a car easy !
it was the best empanada i have ever had .
the fries are shoestring and completely satisfying .

they obviously are all dishonest and <UNK> <UNK> .
"that patty is thick , i mean really thick ."
- lrb - i did n't see that elsewhere .

i ordered the mac and cheese .
otherwise it ' s super basic .

we made sure we were all set with james .
at <UNK> so much .

def a hidden gem !
hear my <UNK> call .
he was very nice and friendly .
i ' ve been to the one in maryland .
my husband said his prime rib had zero flavor .
i asked for them to be thick .
maybe they need more cheerful servers like her .
he seemed really unhappy to be there .
it was a great time .
"love , love , love mastro ' s ."
i guess they do n't open til noon .
the lights were amazing .
the portion is large enough to share with another .
"also , great service !"
"this place is awesome , 0 very satisfied customers ."
"for my meal , i ordered the steak frites ."
wonderful combos such as blackberry peach ... mmmmm ... .
it did n't blow me away ... at all .
other than that ... it was really great .
"hence , knuckle down ."
been here since my <UNK> year at pitt .
we got my car started and took it there .
the service was not great .
this was the best money ever spent .
the servers and hosts are very kind .
do n't waste your time .
although i felt his pasta was too clumped together .
it is good food 00/0 !
good sales too ; - rrb - meh .
make sure you air out your house .
thank goodness we did n't pay to get in !
always friendly family service and delicious food to boot .

it was absolutely delicious .
a bit overpriced but a great selection !
i have always liked this one .
grilled chicken panini and turkey burger were wonderful .
great place to stop on our road trip .
<UNK> it ' s a pyramid !
nothing fabulous to report .
finally food shows up after complaining about it .
i love this place .
this particular boutique is wayyy out of my budget .
never disappointed with the food or service .
this was my favorite hotel while here .
would you consider letting your customers serve themselves ?
we had our wedding cake made by bakery magic .
"so , there is that ."
! ! drink are awesome !
"one star for decor , 0 for service ."
the people are nice and the desserts are fantastic !
the best breakfast in montreal !
i have been to many locations over the years .
i would definitely return for another purchase .
i would highly recommend them !
no dinner for me tonight .
nice to have another irish pub downtown !
no herbs or flavor whatsoever .
something about marshmallow vodka that just seems so right .
"extensions , cut , color , lashes , wax ."
it was clean and nice .
comes with 0 skewers of incredibly <UNK> pork cubes .
but <UNK> its vegas i guess everything goes huh .
now they have the worst .
the prices are very reasonable ... .
this happened to me after booking on hotels.com .
the chips and salsa we ' re good .
the mussels were out of this world !
the prices here are very reasonable .
although probably not so healthy it was really good !
this hotel smells bomb ... everywhere .
it was worth it !
ask for the special sauce .
definitely not worth the price .
especially those who normally like a <UNK> at dinner .
chicken sandwich was dry .
my aunt had the lamb kabob .
the veggie pizza was <UNK> of freshly chopped veggies .
love the ambiance and would definitely come back .
it was a good portion and really filling .

it ' s located inside the cosmopolitan hotel .
i am in love with the <UNK> .
food smelled good during the ride home .
it ' s so tasteful and healthy !
the service is good .
everything was done really quickly too which was great .
we got the <UNK> and <UNK> con chorizo .
maybe i ' m picky .
they have parking for everybody .
i ' ll explain in a bit ... .
we had the tuna tartare and it was divine !
and i mean terrible .
the whole place has a lovely relaxed vibe .
you get a slice of pizza salad and drink .
be careful when coming here .
"the sanitation grade looked decent , though ."
both dishes were amazing !
we waited about 00 min for our food .
go in and give it a try !
myself and my 0 dogs are very disappointed .
really enjoyed our night here .
mongolian beef and pineapple seafood rice is great .
it felt upscale but simplistic at the same time .
all three lattes are absolutely delicious .
they will ship their products too !
this place obviously needs new management or something .
too sweet and overprice !
hubby ordered hamburger steak .
just a little bummed that prices are inevitably climbing .
and their menu looked fabulous .
' ' we were just kind of agreeable .
the barista was on point and friendly .
00 minutes later i was seen .

"even though , i was already outside ."
<UNK> crisps for that crunch .
had to ask for refills of drinks ... everytime .
i would reccomend the elegant barn !
have n't had anything we do n't like .
they were clearly in love with their dishes .
every dish was overcooked .
. we were starving by then .
and their salads and appetizers were equally delicious .
i have n't done many buffets in vegas .
not everyone offers hot and cold crab legs .
friendly and super attentive without being intrusive .
i had a chicken salad that was awesome !
i ordered the mix plate which is $ 00 .
i had the chicken & waffles .
you wo n't be sorry !
chips were also amazing .
the mustard was awesome !
unfortunately the fried rice was dry and tasteless .
the amount of people camping out amazed me .
"nope , she could n't do that ."
this show is not family friendly .
mediocre but edible 0 .
"oh boy , where do i start ?"
it was just a burger .
"the quesadilla itself was nice , soft and fluffy ."
my favorite teacher is <UNK> .
casual and totally reasonable prices .
food and service is great too !

the meat was tender and tasty .
seems to cater to all different walks .
i will continue to be a avid shopper here .

the servers were very attentive and helpful .
great wine list too !
i ordered <UNK> ' s famous pasta .
"however , the outside portion is amazing !"
the school is also very clean .
but this restaurant is well worth it !

beach what ? ! ? shame of them !
this is children ' s haven .
the service at the goodyear location is better too !
. casually making conversations .
"he was friendly , attentive and helpful !"
i think there are 0 different ones .
this shop is a sham !
it ' s best to share !
it ' s antibiotic and <UNK> angus beef .
i ' m so glad i did .
nothing jumped out at me .
really loved this place !
al pastor tacos are delish .
there were no turkey or vegetarian breakfast meat substitutes .
it was n't that pleasant .

the tuna <UNK> § <UNK> does n't miss either .
"lol overall , it ' s a good experience ."
and my food came out like a soup .
the coffee flavor was strong but delicious .
do n't waste your time !
good enough for me .
you also get a complimentary bread basket and butter .
service is always great !
i will def back !

the service was slow an inattentive .
our food came and we were starved !
the drinks were great and cupcakes ... perfect !

"so we took it , not everything fit !"
the waitress apologized and came to our table .
we finally found house of <UNK> .
it was a tourist crowd for sure .
i want to go back !
our server was amazing !
cost was great too !
i am talking <UNK> !
we thought they were over all really good .
soul has no price tag .
the prices are really not that different from starbucks .
its good but not my favorite at all .
and they all were great !
hubby had green chile <UNK> .
i had high expectations and i was let down .
it was very fresh and had lots of flavor .
"today , i found mold in my cup ."
the fries were also decent .
i had the ceviche and roasted artichoke salad .
incorporating pink floyd was genius !
i ordered the wild mushroom fettuccine .
we ' ll most definitely be back !
we enjoyed our stay .
she drank it all and really liked it .
it was to die for .
do n't think my waistline would appreciate it .
<UNK> no hold music .
i have had almost every roll on their menu .
"our server amazing really liked , bartender amazing ."
thanks for the memories !
what was annoying : not enough seating in room .
i thought it was bland and watery .
i do n't think of ever coming back .
my favorite thing about this hotel is its location .
i wish i had ordered the green .
but watch out for cranky cashier girl !
sit outside & people watch .
the service was extremely slow .
holy crap am i happy i discovered this place .
the acts were breathtaking .
the sauce was n't memorable either .
she stated that she would try .
"terrible service , terrible food ."
"only downside , no help to your car ."
"that said , here ' s what we experienced ."
everyone please try to sashimi !
<UNK> in your <UNK> status !
0.0 / 0 good <UNK> !
very disappointed by this company .
and this began the 00 minute sit .
it is very inconvenience .
phoenix flower shops made our wedding day very special .
the service was fantastic .
i hope it <UNK> and grows .
great service and great atmosphere !
they employees were friendly as well .
i ordered the baklava .
their grilled pimento cheese sandwich with tomato is fantastic !
i actually want to do it again .
it ' s so cozy and homey ... .
tip : dont forget the pick 0 !
"sounds safe , let ' s do it ."
"yum , yum , yum ."
pricey but worth it !
"the noodles were cooked fine , just boring ."
first time here and i was very satisfied !
i ' m not disappointed by the food .
everything else was not good .
it was definitely well worth the money .
i assume it gets way more hectic at night .
not too busy at all .
we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip .
that would have been good customer service .
the food was absolutely fabulous !
meals and service are always great !
i did n't even taste any lemongrass .
both were ok and pretty standard .
<UNK> will be the end of me .
perfect for a hot summer day .
the workers here and very professional and friendly !
this is probably standard practice for this company .
amazing service and food .
love the flower selection .
. but what starbucks is n't .
- rrb - but we were actually insulted !
absolutely loved this place !
right on time and excellent customer service .
the chicken sandwich was delectable .
i ca n't wait to try them all !
everybody went there to hang out or what ?
<UNK> ... wo n't be going back .
the salad was amazing .
you ' re in and out in a flash .
now if you are saying ` ` frog legs ?
our one sandwich ran us $ 0.00 .
. nothing too delicious stood out .
"thankfully , the one in vegas remains the same ."
they only have about 00 seats at the bar .
definitely the best thai food restaurant in chandler .
their rolls are huge and full of flavor .
the croissants here were huge .
this is going to be long .
she also honored our tight schedule .
good food and fairly priced .
and thus my rating of meh .
"inconsistent housekeeping , not reliable ."
i wish more people were like you .
their prices are fair .
the symptoms continue for days .
def buying one before i leave .
nothing to write home about but something for yelp .
- rrb - at night time .
it felt like an olive garden on steroids .
there were 0 of us .
best pizza place ever !
definitely worth the stop in the area !
i would rather shop for food than anything else .
"the pool was nice , quiet and scenic ."
and she has been there ever since .
not a great experience .
the whole rustic feeling .
do n't do it .
he refused to accept our deals .
i thought that was a pretty crazy statement .
just a bowl of mush .
"fries were good , and burgers were omg delicious ."
they really seem to want you to try everything .
ca n't wait to go back !
we had a great time !
we waited 00 minutes for the food .
we were in and out in about 00 minutes .
i love the ambiance and the food !
- rrb - and flavor - lrb - !
how i wish i never moved here .
please view my photos with our conversation .
"but very , very slow ."
it was never acknowledged any way what so ever .
and they taste amazing too .
hands down the best pool ever !
i will be back .
the wrap tasted amazing .
we were asked to wait for a while .
service & staff were excellent & attentive .
the worst pad thai i have ever had ... .
i would highly recommend this tour .
the people were pretty laid back as well .
do n't be fooled .
i do n't recall having any complaints .
we ended our meal with the pumpkin custard .
i still have no <UNK> .
staff when checking in very happy & friendly .
great to finally find one i loved !
i absolutely love the venetian .
my husband and i stayed here last weekend .
service was great considering we were a big group .
i was actually a bit disappointed going here .
i saw it offered here on the menu .
i almost did n't want to leave .
maybe that is the thing to get ?
the salsa bar was pretty dismal .
he was sampling fresh salsas he just made .
the pool and lazy river were great fun !
just dined there tonight .
we will definitely be back .
the vegetables here are so fresh .
"ok , sometimes i still giggle ."
popcorn and curried carrot hummus delicious as well .
definitely a fun place to visit !
danish had just enough filling inside a light pastry .
the salads are great and ice <UNK> .
too bad the food was n't good .
she did not take responsibility at all .
everything about this visit was warm and inviting .
immediately ordered a margarita .
have n't had anything i disliked .
"saturday night , 0:00 pm , 0 hour wait ."
i just replied yes !
maybe get carry out ?
"service was excellent , food was fantastic !"
the portions are large and could easily be shared .
so much to choose from .
beware of high <UNK> and garages .
is the sushi the absolute best ?
i loved our waitress she was really helpful .
"good , but skip 0 ."
i did n't enjoy them .
this one does n't .
as for the <UNK> part of the show .
i met some friends at burger 00 for lunch .
really awesome my new favorite lunch spot .
they have everything you could imagine .
"i love the trend , relaxing feel ."
fish and chips were horrible !
we ordered some cocktails and food to share .
i hope the staff over here gets it together !
their black bean hummus is super yummy .
its always fresh and clean .
"overall , i felt like this place was ok ."
the whirlpool and steam room were small and crowded .
sue does such a great job .
"you name it , they have it ."
the meat is a little salty .
all of the above was n't really outrageous .
i love this place !
just suck it up because you signed a contract .
every class i go to is different .
"everything was fresh , if a little greasy ."
chocolate covered strawberries ... ?
i ' m that snobby <UNK> .
"flaky , buttery and chilled to the right temperature ."
what the hell happened today ? ! great food !
i probably will skip this location next time .
came here to have drinks after school .
i trust precision and eric thoroughly .
michelle who does their events was absolutely wonderful !
so far so good .
do n't stay here .
i go here very often .
attended acts last night .
i trust him completely !
i just felt so sick afterwards .
"unfortunately , i was unimpressed ."
many goodies yet to try .
"with tax , i paid $ 0.00 ."
clearly i ' m a fan .
"dear todd english , your son is gorgeous ."
really enjoyed the burger .
wo n't be coming back .
they definitely need one in san diego !
"we had shwarma , falafel , gyro ."
"other than that , there were no complaints ."
nothing to complain at all !
one of my favorite clubs in vegas .
this sounds very healthy but is delicious .
dr . hampton is the best !
whipped cream is not homemade .
"overall , i liked journey ."
a different server brought the next course .
"for dinner , we had an amazing thanksgiving feast ."
it would otherwise be 0/0 stars .
the store was clean .
we can not thank levi enough !
not the night shift .
great friday evening activity .
there are literally 0 working elevators in the lobby .
i ordered a mai tai and it was delicious .
the shoe sample selection is great .
that was almost two weeks ago .
why did n't anyone think of this sooner ?
the room was clean and the bed was nice .
make sure you try the coconut bark !
"good service , even funnier !"
it ' s a cowboy joint for sure .
will definitely go back .

0 of us stayed comfortably .
so happy this place opened so close to us !
. do n't do it .
' ' i was nervous because mother is particular .
i ' m a fan !
we always order the chicken which is always satisfying .
i could eat sushi probably four times a week .
you can tell everything is home made .
i ca n't forget the time i spend there .
that was actually my favorite thing about the place .
spumoni or sherbet is included with your meal .
i guess that ' s a pretty good review !
i will definitely hire them again .
0 appetizer and a main dish is fulfilling .
who knew ! ? we do ... now .
i will absolutely go back and highly recommend !
so we proceeded to order anyway .
i think the food is over priced but dependable .
friendly people but come on .
eggs are cooked perfectly which is rare indeed !
"otherwise , unfriendly employees ."
we stopped in on a saturday morning early .
"which is probably a good thing , really ."
great place to eat !
no let me get you a manager .
our penthouse was incredible .
he did his job & was professional .
people watching is optimal at this place !
"the manager on duty wayne , was absolutely amazing !"
my friend and i ate and enjoyed the atmosphere .
i also saw people bringing in their own food .
feel free to come as you are !
its so tangy and nasty .
the potatoes were delicious .
"wow , what a great find !"
loved the salad bar !
try a pickle with your meat .
even their silverware and their plates were nice .
just bring a blanket and sunscreen and enjoy .
i did n't see a single one .
we both had basic bacon and eggs type breakfasts .
i love this place for breakfast .
"a favorite with me and now , my friends ."
"fresh , vibrant and tasty meals ."
def go with the extra shots regardless !
. i totally wanted what he had .
they have some delish dessert pastries & breads .
the menu runs the same between them as well .

"sweet republic on the other hand , is not !"
do you not know how to open a fence ?
we really enjoy our time here !
"great customer service , good food ."
went out on a date here .
i was very happy with the service .
but this location left me wanting .
"i mean hello , the brunch clock was ticking ."
everything was fresh and the sauces were flavorful .
the naan was not bad either .
its my second home too .
do you serve drinks in this restaurant ?
breakfast is not included .
' ' what is with you people ... .
it was drew <UNK> - who knew ?
"also , i ordered my entree mild to medium ."
they had tons of great shoes and clothes .
it ' s worth the wait .
that was n't very nice .
she took our drink orders and left .
i really thought she had completely <UNK> out !
when the appetizers did arrive they were a disappointment .
. love the makeup section .
love love loved it .
i waited an extremely long time .
i mean he is really focused on me .
then they wo n't let you leave .
jerk turkey burger is so good .
resort fees for each person you pay $ 00.00 .
and we are n't ordering anything special !
actually the inside too .
went here on a whim and was pleasantly surprised .
i will absolutely be back .
very food <UNK> and the pitas were fresh .
i think i will go again .
i was a little disappointed this time .
this portion size was very large for tapas .
thanks for a great first experience <UNK> !
"overall , food was decent and priced not outrageously ."
we had an excellent waitress .
"also , there ' s nothing really vegan here ."
they have gluten free bread !
the rooms were clean and enough space for everyone .
it was rather sweet .
"however , i did not regret my decision !"
keep in mind i get massages all the time .
he has chicken breast <UNK> meh at best .
like something a 0 year old would do .
we had the aloha pizza and garlic parmesan wings .
i would n't recommend pick up orders .
"however , the portion sizes are a bit extreme !"
our steaks were cooked perfectly .
he said the ribs were really tender and tasty .
with our without the bun is still delicious .
we will never return .
"the pictures did n't lie , lol ."
and we live here .
"luckily , they had hot sauce ."
"never heard back from them , though ."
"neither were great , neither were bad ."
"but , i hated the seating there ."
i ' m just not into this place anymore .
i really want to love this place too !
and the lobby smells amazing !
"the service is friendly , quick , and attentive ."
the associates at this location are <UNK> !
they use quality ingredients and their dishes are creative .
it looks very antique and classic .
amazing happy hour as well .
yelp 0000 000 for 000 challenge - review # 00
but today i was highly disappointed .
not very pleased wo n't return .
the weather is beautiful !
this is an excellent vegan restaurant .
the half was too much for me .
"even then , the service was kinda sad ."
the owner was a sweetheart .
they also have naughty candy to suck .
the service was meh .
so we almost gave up .
every bite is filled with goodness .
i found a spot though !
the staff are amazing and the food is amazing .
i like egg in my omelet .
i never felt rushed .
i drank heavily here .
service was great too .
it was huge and delicious .
the burrito was sausage and potatoes .
"the shrimp were large , sweet and perfectly cooked ."
they have a return customer for sure !
especially if you like deep tissue work .
the service was fine and the prices were decent .
yummy and fresh and special made to order !
we started off by ordering some drinks .
staff are always friendly .
a server then comes and takes your drink order .
they even have a water dish for pups !
no parmesan crisp ... .
the spicy tangerine vinaigrette had some kick to it .
the dumplings were yum !
i have to agree !
once again they prove to be <UNK> .
it was four dollars and change for a large .
the service was really great too .
everyone hates going but we have to go .
everything looks so <UNK> and neatly displayed .
the service was great : very friendly and speedy .
$ 00 is a lot better than $ 000 !
there were two other workers .
so we walked down the royal mile .
i would have preferred it to just be braised .
no beer flavored water for me .
it comes out ... hmm .
the guys were so nice .
they are cooked on a rotisserie like a gyro yummy
do not go here !
first time eating thai food and i loved it .
but it was not rich .
it just hits the spot .
where is the meat ?
it was still enough to fill me !
i needed a new battery .
the staff was friendly .
i will definetly recommend this place !
where do i start ?
we also got in for free .
the caesar salad is pre and over dressed .
i would definitely return to this lovely restaurant !
the dough is to die for !
all my friends said their meals were good .
everything came out really quick .
i had nothing that surprised me with <UNK> .
the sample cups are huge .
big sign out front says $ 0 scoops today !
i took my car to the dealership .
- rrb - as our server .
do not waste your time or your money .
why is something wrong ?
our sever tommy was beyond friendly and super funny !
i will be returning again .
the food was bland .
"thin crust , crispy <UNK> and awesome olives ."
i ' m not a dessert person .
the more important thing is : gelato gelato gelato .
charlie palmer knows how to put together a menu .
the decor is appropriate for it ' s name .
i come here all the time .
order of fries was pretty small for $ 0 .
got that 0nd tattoo just a few weeks ago .
they also have chocolate covered bacon .
have tried so many dishes and all are great .
this is my new favorite smoothie place !
hollandaise on the side .
"the food was good , fresh , fast ."
"yes , he did ."

you ' ll feel bad for the horses though .

last saturday we are at the bar .
this place is fantastic !
i love that it ' s free .
just a bunch of people standing around doing nothing .
wolfgang puck does n't disappoint !
their special recipes are delicious !
so we just walked out .
the prices are a bit much for bar food .
thanks a bunch lupe ...
the poutine was extremely rich .
everything was thrown in the middle .
- rrb - i do n't really eat here .
there was no reason for her to be unwelcoming .
it was not overwhelmingly crowded .
coconut soup with hot level is so good !
pretzel with beer cheese .
sushi bar looked weird .
people ... save your money !
all the bartenders were great and friendly .
pros : - games !
"had lunch here the other day , unfortunately !"
i would never recommend this place to anyone .
they gave out <UNK> !
a lot of customers were coming in for takeout .
breakfast all day and awesome service !
it ' s date night !
its a very small salad bar .
kind of pricey for sub-par food .
and they were not crappy ones either .
made reservations for saturday breakfast the night before .
she ' s so ... personable .
my spaghetti was salty .
i tried the autumn pumpkin and it was delicious .
but she was nasty and rude to me !
even the bars are swanky .
waited another 00 minutes and gave up .
no cover for awesome bands .
"despite being darker beer , i liked it !"
i could definitely crave both of these !
my son loves this place but not me .
i was really disappointed in this restaurant .
"sorry oscar , i think you need new management ."
everything about this experience was perfect .

i thought that was pretty cool to have .
the staff is very friendly and efficient .
"yes , it is embarrassing , but super fun !"
the restaurant was truly beautiful .
i found it here .
"okay , so there are some dated ."

the service is amazing and the staff is great !
truly is quite addicting .
would not do it again .
and service is alright !
absolutely perfect from the minute you walk in .
"bacon , eggs , bread ."
they insisted payment be made in full right then .
we saw many people turned away .
this place was great and so was the price .
i will be back .
the shopping center is very easily accessible .
she ' s really nice and sweet !
avoid it at all cost !
"that ' s just perfect , too ."
nothing to write home about .
it was downright magical .
i would recommend their pizza to anyone !
warning : sweet daddy cupcakes are addictive .
you wo n't believe it .
"however , the server was pretty friendly and fast ."
their garlic infused ranch is soooo good !
it was rather busy as our dinner went on .
these were the smallest sized tapas i ever had .

a shot of smirnoff for $ 0.00 ?
very bad experience trying to board my dog .
i ordered the tuna sashimi for $ 00 .
this quiznos is not good to go to .
the truffle parm fries were not good .
then sat down and ate his bowl inside .

i do n't think i ' ll be back .
the chef was very heavy on the salt !
"gets busy , specially weekends and after <UNK> ."
happy hour - awesome !
it was n't bad .
waiter was irritable and sarcastic .
"honestly though , i did n't need it ."
their dessert area is to die for !

the house special side was awesome .
food : love their wide array of sliders .

- - wrapping the duvet in sheets .
"in a day clearing 0,000 . 00 ."
i even took a basket home .
town square was fun and very well maintained .
it was the perfect ending to a wonderful meal .

ok - i ' ll admit it .
i came in to buy a mascara .
i will say that the everything went pretty well .
normally people rave about hot n juicy .
noah was very professional .
i had skin all over my hands .
my car is way cooler than inside the store .
we always order baba ghanoush for appetizer .
. i know better now lol .
disappointing seared scallops with carrot butter and green beans .
the flautas were very small .
their menu has quite a variety .
best 0 $ margarita in town !
it ' s so worth it though .
' ' not once did he call me !
it never happened though .
my husband thought it was overcooked .
i wo n't come back .
they are honest and informative .
this was a wonderful meal .
wednesday nights are trivia night .
they have a really great appetizer selection .
"nope , not even close ."
we mostly <UNK> in the bar and watched <UNK> .
i have already recommended him to my friends .

i have definitely had better elsewhere .
i doubt i will ever return .
los faves or die .
it was truly a good experience .
everything smelled and looked great !
i was shocked and <UNK> !
all the employees are super nice !
this location is not the same as maryland location .
do not go to the buffet .
it was literally next to my shoulder .
the lemon dipping sauce was yummy though .
this was my first time using <UNK> .
they offer no assign seats .
"and third , the quality is amazing !"
i loved this place .
the ambiance definitely makes this place amazing .

"i mean , seriously afraid ."
we liked the thick tzaziki sauce served with it .
i wish it was a little crispier .
"so , be sure to ask for your drink ."
the latte was super refreshing .
. garlic knots to die for .
the food was hit or miss .
. oh my toilet would like to disagree .
please do not waste your money ! !

gorgeous gorgeous nightclub located in the wynn hotel ... .
then they try to rush you .
also some gelato made for lactose intolerant people !
we both ordered pulled pork plates .
the burgers are just okay .
hostess that sat us i think was crying .
other stores make you fend for yourself .
i was just there for the pizza .
fun place to throw a cute birthday party .
they do n't totally disclose it to you .
i have only ever had take-out here twice .
i went in for iced coffee .
"shrimp , and fries ."
"what an <UNK> , uninteresting , and vulgar person ."
"we were hooked , we had to get them ."
i just wish it was n't in that sauce .

it comes with lemon and without condensed milk .
it ' s going to be 000 today .
this location was no exception .
way to go <UNK> ' s !

the crowd ... i could live without .
we ended up not even <UNK> a second bite .
usually i ' m stuffed just from the entree !
do n't fill up on bread !
we will definitely be back !
the four of us each ordered the oxtail soup .
the ice cream is awesome too !
we started with house margaritas and cold <UNK> .
the burgers are simply ginormous .
the bar was well attended and looked well stocked .
the single fried plantain was nice though .
"anyway , our server was okay ."
you ' ve got to eat at joes !
my favorite place to go grocery shopping !
i like it and order this every time .
no minibar for snacks .
"portions are very small , but food is delicious ."
loved the hipster vibe .
i had the tamales with rice and veggies .
"again , we were not disappointed !"
it was just a mess .
pest control is supposed to come every tuesday .
"- rrb - food was mediocre , overpriced ."
the rooms were very clean !
first time eating here and will definitely be back .
i would be willing to come back again .
our meal was done to perfection !
it came with the most <UNK> salsa ever .
not a big fan of this place though .
i would definitely go back .
straight up hot bitches .
also great friday fish fry .
she noticeably rolled her eyes .
but other than that it was great !
the food is delicious but service is slow .
perfectly light and fluffy on warm brioche !
"everything was n't perfect , but it was great ."
staff was super friendly .
tonight was my first time here .
we love the live jazz ! ! !
it ' s ` ` eh ' ' .
good thing i was n't in the toilet .
i highly recommend them .
the waitresses are super nice and very pretty .
the lady at the counter was super rude .
never heard from the guy !
thank you chef <UNK> and team !
i would recommend this hotel .
i love a good deal !
soft-shell crab : huge pieces of crab tempura .
"first , the tableside guac ."
amazing food and the service is just as wonderful .
"tender , juicy burgers with lots o ' cheese ?"
something is wrong with this picture !
so fresh and sweet !
"also , veggies were more on the colder side ."
i ' ve never loved gumbo this much .
mine was okay ... nothing exceptional .
items are around $ 0 on average .
do n't judge me !
i love the big windows letting natural light in .
the food and service were wonderful .
the process was easy enough .
i absolutely loved the potato salad .
the price was definitely enticing .
she explained how the menu works .
. very fun night .
the guy was super nice .
i miss roberto ' s .
"plus , they hardly put any chicken on it !"
our waiter helped us decide on the desserts .
we got a nice booth at the bar .
staff is very friendly and helpful .
there was no offer to make it right .
i would also recommend the white sangria .
i feel sorry for the employees .
i tipped the cook !
food was <UNK> & roasted veggies which were good .
five stars for the great customer service !
totally rich and satisfying .
the store was clean and organized .
not a great start to date night .
the corn and the brisket sliders are fantastic .
i just can not get comfortable .
workers have always been friendly .
portions are also ridiculously small .
the most amazing prawn and artichoke orzo pasta ever .
amazing italian dishes in adorable little pans .
i could n't eat my sandwich slower .
i loved their eggs benedict !
i had to cry for you to believe me ?
which made me sad to hear .
"but wait , it gets better ."
i was glad we only ordered one .
i went there for lunch with a coworker today .
"was here last night , briefly ."
they do n't care about their customers !
they did offer me water while i waited .
why did i just go two days then ?
"still , i ' m glad we went !"
p . s . great desserts too !
<UNK> has hand dipped shakes .
the basic was a favorite - perfect <UNK> ratio !
we watch too many food network shows .
the music was too loud .
i was full and drunk at that point .
and the garlic bread .
it was super <UNK> .
i preferred the one at taco ' s bell .
the service is great and friendly .
with no warning of excessive fees !
but why start so bad ?
maybe next time ill just get the regular fries !
the dessert is hit !
we will go back !
they have pretty much everything i need .
i wish there was more .
oh but that doesnt matter to them .
it is there for what i need .
so we had to support .
my friend ordered the buffalo chicken wrap .
"as it cools , reality sets in ."
she was so nice .
she of course asked for money .
or the sweet factory .
fortunate to have stumbled upon this delightful cafe .
what more can you ask for !
this place was amazing .
we asked for the 00oz size .
do n't <UNK> me with your logic !
drinks and the bread basket came quickly .
how does that happen ?
we proceeded to get sat a few minutes later .
not my favorite consistency .
very pleasant ! ! their salsa is my favorite .
"ordered appetizers and food , and nothing disappointed ."
but once u do enter its cute inside .
only positive for hotel is the pool .
but inside it ' s really just lovely .
"we both agreed , the food was extremely bland ."
everyone was pleased with the food and service .
the dressing was overly sour for my taste .
the menu was overwhelming and went on for pages .
the <UNK> blend was sweet ... .
there is also gelato and mochi ice cream .
"but seriously , 0 little croutons each ?"
the hawaiian bento is both delicious and hearty .
do you see a pattern emerging ?
got ta love italian men !
0st time was new year ' s eve .
very nice environment and clean !
both were absolutely wonderful .
forget your diet when you come here .
we think this shop is great .
it ' s past chinatown maybe <UNK> not far .
you could definitely tell everything was fresh and authentic .
"so bummed , bad move wynn !"
sitting at the food court is not as fancy .
i definitely will not be going back .
"we love you , <UNK> ."
the flavors here are more subtle .
it was quiet and the service was excellent .
crappy <UNK> coffee and tea .
way too overpriced wine & the service was slow .
"yes , the <UNK> marks were on the menu ."
"i think , yes !"
it was already packed .
i definitely recommend her !
my husband had a bento box with teriyaki chicken .
this is by far our favorite pizza place .
the menu changes around occasionally .
for one a nice large room .
well for an airport i really have no complaints .
"they were very different , and both were exceptional !"
"love , love , love this place ."
the first time i went was for lunch .
shop could n't get much more adorable .
<UNK> for out-of-town guests .
cracked egg sandwich was good .
be on the look out !
did i mention the friendly service ?
really delicious and inexpensive mexican food .
i really think it needed a bit of flavor .
but of course it was .
"oh , and did i mention fantastic sushi !"
the <UNK> distribution was inconsistent ans stingy .
are n't we downtown at a pizza joint ?
"man , was i wrong ."
i do n't mind eating by myself .
then i think everyone would have a better time .
- rrb - and i leave happy every time .
the girls were very friendly and helpful .
they were ready by the time we got seated .
i especially like the pickled red onions .
even the bouncer is cool !
came here for lunch !
we ' ve been going here for years .
we will definitely will be back ... and soon !
how could you not love that combo .
"the hookah , food , & drinks are great ."
who does that ! ? wonderful customer service .
:p rooms are nice tho !
this is awesome served warm .
i would have steered clear of the shop .
they know our pups and love on them .
customer service was awesome !
it ' s denny ' s .
and my <UNK> ordered the chicken souvlaki .
roberto ' s never disappoints .
i liked : - the spicy salsa .
it ' s still spacious enough .
the lack of consistency is truly a travesty .
i think that is pricey .
they do nothing for what we pay them .
hopefully these girls will get updated training .
"i recently moved to phoenix from reno , nv ."
"fine , but not delicious ."
"of course , i ordered the pho ."
lovely new addition to south end !
got the mac n <UNK> and truffle potatoes .
all i can say is oh my gosh !
all problems were addressed immediately and with a smile .
creamed spinach infused with bacon ?
i do n't eat bacon .
honey toast bomb bomb such a delight .
tasteless toasts straight from the supermarket .
both times the cake and drink were grand .
"delicious food , handcrafted cocktails , and amazing staff ."
we replied that it was a simple date night .
the portion is huge !
fun place for happy hour !
easily the most delicious pizza in the shadyside .
the menu is filled with healthy options .
finish your night with an expresso and a cannoli .
i eat these suckers like chips !

i got <UNK> for organic chemistry .
wood fired pizzas are to die for .
the bed could be a higher quality .
