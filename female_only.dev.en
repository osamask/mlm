not sure if they validate parking .

just describing it makes me crave it again .
it came out like a hockey puck .
i ca n't wait to go back !
"seriously , i think my mouth had an orgasm ."
<UNK> perfectly med-rare and the flavors were perfect .
my favorite cupcake is the strawberry shortcake .
but it tasted good !
"plus , the growler are cute here , too ."
and we were overcharged $ 0.00 .
"if so , that is pretty <UNK> ."
it is n't aimed at an upscale clientele .
$ 0 for my dress to be <UNK> .
they also have a million flavors to choose from .
super efficient kitchen that just <UNK> along .
this was the place to go .
just a little too much for me .
i grew up going to this place .
i had judy as my foot therapist .

we had people scamming the system .
the building that it is in is so pristine .

the food is still amazing .
$ 0.00 is n't too bad though .
<UNK> has completely changed my outlook on this .

the owners are very charming .
sundays during football season are the best here .

i ordered the greek salad with chicken .
what a lovely menu !
there was no fishy taste .
the protein pancakes are heavenly !
i would drive across town for this place .

we appreciated that much for sure .
"ok , so i guess we are unloading everything ."
whose spot on with their food .
three of us shared two entrees and were stuffed .

i do n't know how to <UNK> .
thank you for the fun experience .
what ... was ... her problem ?

we ordered our first round of cocktails .
it always seems to be just what i need .
i ordered the month special and it was good !
they have live jazz on thursdays .

we sat outside and it was a gorgeous day .
"overall , it was a fulfilling experience ."
this place is beyond great .
the rooms are huge !
this is one of my favorite bars in vegas .
it was pretty busy when we got there .
dim lighting and dark furniture .
i ' ve had a lot .
we had a fabulous time having drinks and talking .
they have outdoor seating as well which is covered .
their staff and their volunteers are incredibly helpful .
i had the <UNK> and it was good .

"always friendly , and always busy ."
i took two sips and was done .
awesome service and delicious korean food .
i needed an <UNK> box for shipping .
my dogs were fairly happy after the office visit .
i think it ' s worth the extra money .
they have over 00 flavors .
it ' s the best .
cashier checked ... told i was wrong .
i was pleasantly suprised and really loved it .
"so i bite again only , bread ."
pretty sure the restaurant lost money on their visit !
i ' ve never heard such a thing .

thank you to all .
"anyway , i just loved this splash pad !"
great people working there !
i just want to vomit .
<UNK> ' up the brownie points .
i recommend her to everyone .
they are the best .
i think it ' s a pretty balanced cupcake .
the best falafel of my life .
it ' s literally a 00-00 person seating area .
the pickles that came with it were great though .
another perk is how much later their hh goes .
- lrb - at least not yet .
so glad i called <UNK> .
i was <UNK> optimistic and gently dropped .
what i did not love was the lobster taco .
"thrilling , i know ."
friendly staff and delicious food !
the grade at the location is 00 health inspection .
the <UNK> shots are n't half bad here too !
the food was a bit <UNK> for me .
i really wish bands would stop doing shows here .
he also checked the bathtub area .
i wanted to come here and see for myself .
i could feel my teeth breaking into each layer .
"great food , good service , wonderful over-all experience !"

people holding vip tickets ended up going first .
it was just all too much for me .
will definitely be back .
he finished with strawberry mochi .
they had endless options for food .
mom had a fish sandwich and fries .
what an awesome experience .

made me utterly sick .
i also ordered the curry <UNK> .
egg rolls were disgusting .
i wish i could have taken a picture .
our server <UNK> rocks !
very disappointed by their treatment and disregard for customers .
not a big place so make reservations .
we love the apple roll !
these tasted like cardboard .
the complex itself had countless more !
all the dishes were very flavorful .
i ' d bet she did n't inform management .
that ' s where we are happiest anyway .
the atmosphere is beautiful and relaxing .
way to much money for poorly executed rolls .
: - lrb - conference room : comfortable .
thank you planet hollywood !
i got lost coming back from the bathroom .
friendly service and decent portions !
the staff was really friendly also .
the concierge greeted us .

my son just participated in their summer reading program .
again the portion was itty bitty .
"when i ate it , that confirmed my fear ."

we visited this location in phoenix in october .
i have found my jeweler !
i could eat the other half for dinner .
did n't like the flavor .
the coffee is good .
all in all a great night !
we ' re always pleased with the friendly staff .
never told the specials .
their employees are friendly and knowledgeable .
these guys are super patient n friendly !
my daughter did n't even touch it .
always in their fav .
there is no need for it .
a decent selection of food and sushi .
we had plenty of leftovers to take home .
it just melt in your mouth .
i need the recipe asap !
however they made it up to me .
. never will i spend my money here again ...
"for $ 0 , it was worth it ."
i have to say it was disappointing .
the employees are really professional same as the vets .
do n't waste your money !
"yes , that is a mouthful ."
a break ? ? my mom was a doctor .
by far the worst sushi i have ever had .
but it was good !
i love filipino food .
lots of seating and enough outlets .
everyone was nice and not pretentious .
"pretty delicious , and a lovely shade of lavender ."
"well , i loved jersey mikes up until now !"
"the atmosphere is relaxed , elegant , and inviting ."
food was drowning in oil .
the sauce on it was very yummy .
it is seriously to die for .
at least it has its own parking lot .
i big puffy heart these women !
amazing food and service !
it ' s the best !
"their sangria is also great , super refreshing ."
they make your eggs anyway you want them .
that was <UNK> interesting .
save your money and party in vegas proper !
this church had become my favorite event each week .
not a detail was missed .
"i ordered the rib eye , medium ."
will be coming back !
the food was good but the service was terrible .
fusion specialty bento box !
after that everything was good but not crave worthy .
"it was n't all bad , though ."
delivery time is fast also .
the fries were soggy .
their sandwiches are delicious too !
i immediately asked to speak to the manager .
it is two stories and is a bar .
. you guessed it !
went to eat here for a friends birthday .
complaint # 0 : my caesar salad .
it ' s fluffy pancake goodness .
i really enjoyed the ricotta <UNK> and burrata .
the service is friendly and quick .
i got about 00 pieces for 00 dollars .
` ` it ' s that .
. downtown mesa needs to get its props .
the beans were crunchy and flavorful .
i definitely will go back !
the dirty could have been more dirty .
it was a fantastic ambiance and service .
"soap and amenities are nice , not fabulous ."
great service and delicious !
the people on his team were equally wonderful .
she could n't even finish half of her order .
this is not it .
"meh , not great ."
"place was not very clean , nor inviting ."
i have never had such bad customer service !
although their dessert was absolutely delectable and huge .
really generous portion for kids meal .
the fish tacos were generously portioned for the price point .
when i saw the fact that this show <UNK> water it peaked my interest !
got my first root canal and i am so glad i came here !
"for sushi , their ika was good and their sake - lrb - salmon - rrb - was pretty darn fresh tasting ."
needless to say they did n't like when we started a u of a <UNK> ; - rrb -
of course i just got voicemail and 0 days later no one called back .
they should focus less on being trendy and hard to find and more on making amazing sushi .
"when i came there , they told me that my order will not be ready til 0 pm ."
listen to the waiter he knows what he is talking about
"i know , most food is delicious late at night at the bar ... but , for real ."
best price i could find in town for iphone 0 screen replacement !
i had been wanting to try this restaurant for a while .
i will try the cream cheese frosting next time and will probably get it from now on .
its the day before my coworkers birthdays when i realize i need to get a pie .
they made sure my boyfriend always had a drink in his hand .
it ' s got a crispy outer shell and soft <UNK> inside .
the bakery offers a lot of goodies and yummy sweets and really good gifts .
"i got their full size ham , salami , cheese sandwich on their homemade baguette ."
i paid $ 00 for someone to help lotion me up ... that ' s it .
he says no can do but that we are in luck .
"ask for water in a kids cup , took them 00min or so ."
we spent a beautiful sunday afternoon at rattlesnake cove at <UNK> lake .
however that did n't matter as we all ordered off the mixologist .
"overall , great room and even better when it ' s the concierge lounge ."
the drinks were yummy and they even let us sit down without ordering bottle service .
"the lettuce was nasty - - bitter , hardly any leaf , just nasty ."
reminds me of a place back home ... we will be back .
we came here looking for s center stone for my wedding ring .
soooo many flavors and loved ones i never thought i would ever like .
i ' ll go here again but only strictly for sushi .
then when i went to pay with a coupon that included a free meal .
"it was served with lima beans , greens , bread crumbs & parmesan in some light olive oil ."
"their flavors are so fun and unique like rose scented raspberry , or black current tea ."
i have been back several times in the past year .
it was super reasonable in price like 00 dollars and very fresh and plated thoughtfully .
my boyfriend and i got dressed up for the night and wanted to go somewhere fancy .
i am so grateful for all she does to make my life <UNK> .
it reminded me so much of the coffee scene in new zealand .
usually i ca n't tell food is salty just from smelling it .
i wished they had their steamed <UNK> like their closed location .
- lrb - - ___ - # - rrb - i love food stands and this is a must try place .
second was crab cake for me and saw bass for my husband .
my fiancã © took me to see the david copperfield show and we loved it !
they have a lot of interesting foods on the menu so i might go back again .
the only good thing the manager did was offer to pay our bill .
i wish i could tell you that this <UNK> has been helpful to my <UNK> .
we cut close 00 % of it off because of all the fat .
"loved their homemade , pickled <UNK> and <UNK> - lrb - radishes - rrb - ."
they were beyond friendly on the phone and very knowledgeable .
clean room and bathroom which is a must for me !
"to start , when we walked in there was a foul smell in the lobby area ."
it was awsome ! ! ! food : 0 stars !
been with this office for a couple years now and everytime feel this same frustration .
i ordered two rolls where the spicy tuna was ground up .
sat at the bar with my friend and the bartenders / sushi chefs kept us entertained .
"they dont have toppings , <UNK> , chocolate shells , sprinkles , for toppings ."
not too salty and the beef was not over cooked .
he took one look at the <UNK> and started to laugh .
"i was meeting friends there for a brunch / networking thing , it was four of us all together 0 ."
i ordered the classic and i was more than pleased .
"do n't get me wrong , the food was n't bad but it was n't spectacular ."
"as we were eating our main courses , a basket of bread with some olive oil arrived ."
the boyfriend had a rib eye and was quite impressed !
we ' ve tried a few different places and this is the best so far .
"i had a medium caramel gelato , which was <UNK> tasty ."
"you are definitely paying for the atmosphere , which is great so makes it worth it ."
i like the idea of eating <UNK> food in a <UNK> / comfortable environment .
"my husband order the new york steak , which came with really yummy bok choy & asparagus ."
"i was looking forward to this place , and it was a complete let-down ."
he stopped at nothing to make sure we got out of there with what we needed .
"i asked , ` ` ca n't she help me ?"
"another guest had the duck , which was my second choice ."
the green beans were seriously the best i ' ve ever had with the perfect amount of batter .
even tho the parents should really be the ones telling the kids to behave .
the staff is nothing short of spectacular and accommodating : they get 0 stars .
even when there are n't many people in the restaurant .
but then i got distracted by the next round of food !
"i had no idea where to start , so i asked my friend for a recommendation ."
i will definitely be back to this cute little cafe !
"i had something called a <UNK> , a spicy blood orange and jalapeã ± o infused martini , very yummy ."
the guy that was slicing meat was extremely helpful and joyful .
i work in cross <UNK> and have passed la <UNK> many times .
"- lrb - we shopped in the meantime , because there were ample shopping choices nearby ."
loved the spicey basil chicken it had a good balance of flavors and texture .
"the cashier , anthony , is so kind and welcoming ."
"there was also some delicious bread as an intro plate , and pistachios , very fresh ."
"warning , once you have one , it ' ll be really hard to stay away !"
"i wish there was more locations , since i love north scottsdale and closer to me ."
"the casino was ok , waitress was rude and never brought my drink ."
do n't forget accompany your meal with a glass of sweet tea !
it was just the right amount of sweetness and felt like it melted in my mouth .
it did not give the kind of ambience that so many restaurants in la give .
"i had their fish tacos , which was pretty good ."
got my food well after everyone else at my table .
"we dined at the bar - - the bartender , jordan , was attentive and friendly ."
i wish they had some type of caddy to take it all to your table .
"but as far as dives go , it ' s awesome !"
but i was n't able to pick her up after 0pm !
"the food was good , but i prefer meat & potatoes fried chicken and jalepeno waffles ."
"compared to many artisan shops , the prices are actually very reasonable ."
"mm - - mmm ... fall-off-the-bone , savory , and sweet ."
i could feel the heat coming through the wall i was sitting next to .
bakeries in the area were going to charge me twice as much for the same cake .
we are gold members so we utilized the free wifi .
i saw a coupon on <UNK> on yelp for the weekly pass and picked it up right away .
as for the soup it tasted like water with tons of salt in it .
"the owners is are very accommodating , and smiling every time i see them ."
"not only is the ice cream mediocre , the staff at this location are super rude ."
"the first couple of times i got it , but it really started to get annoying ."
now to the food : some dishes are really delicious .
"great seats , fresh popcorn and they serve beer and wine ."
i think our total tab was around $ 00 for 0 of us and my son .
