reminds me of the movie young frankenstein you can spot the conservatives in that mob they are the wingnuts with the pitch forks !
"who cares when i was in the military , i liked thedon't ask , don't tell policy ."
it should like that everywhere and the military should go back to that polici politicians do not have guts to say what is truth .
problem is with muslim faith and its followers .
the imams in mosques double speak .
muslim parents and religious leaders are the ones master minding the terrorists attacks .
"they should preach to love the adopted countries , love the people from other religions and stop thinking of islam/muslims all the time in all the situations ."
you mean that commissioner at dps lied to me about how much his salary was increased under frank ?
the landlord next to me has trees growing six inches from his house .
"what that's doing to the basement masonry , heaven knows ."
"landlords suffer from both sloth and greed , just like the general population ."
obama said why punish them because they did not wrong ?
- by the same token why reward them they did nothing right eith the funniest thing is that this was an entirely self-inflicted wound .
had mcconnell simply let warren read king's 30-year-old letter to a nearly empty senate at 10 pm it would have gone almost unnoticed .
"instead , his arrogant , sexist partisanship put warren in the spotlight and handed her a megaphone ."
i guess mitch never heard of the 'streisand effect' .
"with legislators like pete kelly , coghill , and dunleavy , the state will go broke before a fiscal plan is put forth ."
now many muslims in the middle east and environs have been killed by british troops since ww2 ?
when will the uk pull its troops out of the area ?
i hope that our politician are considering pulling our troops out .
the example on parliament should have made an impression .
the attackers attacked the source of the decision to invade afghanistan .
"i think i have tried my best to argue for common sense among my friends , especially my catholic friends who voted for him anyway because the bishops told them to ."
perhaps they voted according to their consciences - against the culture of death .
will you explain how keystone will get out energy to the asian markets ?
"at my vancouver school in the mid-20th century our ( long-since-deceased ) principal , john arthur colbert , strapped children at the drop of a hat , most of us jewish ."
"i wish more stray cats were gay , then we would have fewer of them ."
allow me to comment on a different point from those below .
"in a time where twitter wars , personal slurs , and a general lack of civility have become the norm , it is encouraging to see ms ."
keesmaat and mayor tory find only good things say in public .
what do you think that the doctors are doing with those samples ?
they are giving them to patients who don't have private insurance .
"to say the least your article is biased , and this is understandable ."
for you are the a member of the elitists which were voted against .
we should all listen to your rant because you are a professor ?
"you have the right to state your opinion , but your area of expertise is asian languages , and obviously not truth in news ."
but i am glad you wrote this article .
"the more people who see and hear your rants , the more support trump gets ."
we are tired of the elitist telling us what to think and what to do .
maybe when the news organizations start reporting the truth people will listen .
there is a reason fox has gained so much following and the others you site are losing followers .
it's because of the the untruths and slanted news they spew .
no these you sited are the left lions .
"but keep it up , for we are winning ."
because of loss of followers i got an email offering me 8 weeks of nyt for five dollars .
if you don't ask the right questions you will never get to the truth .
below are a few excellent questions that should be asked in any clean energy survey .
1 ) would you support clean wind energy in if you knew that the industry had been rigging all turbine mortality research for several decades to produce fraudulent results ?
2 ) would you support clean wind energy if you knew that the interior department had also been rigging research for several decades to produce fraudulent turbine impact results ?
3 ) would you support clean wind energy if you knew that tens of thousands of eagles had been killed by turbines and their carcasses hidden by the interior department ?
4 ) would you support wind energy is you knew that energy production numbers are greatly inflated so this wind industry developers can gouge taxpayers ?
several more clean questions will be added in the next comment .
although i do find it odd that your posts here seem to be counter to other posts you've made about islam .
"then maybe that should tell you something about your assumptions , and question the filter through which you read my other comments ?"
dear ncr/ dennis coday: please let monica d edit and fact check msw's columns before they are published .
but someone has to do it .
sincerely the rogue cathol why are all globe columns about islamic matters always written from the militant muslim's point of view ?
are the rest of us just outsiders ?
no moderate muslim is ever given credence .
all non muslims are dismissed as mere hate mongers .
taking the side of muslims against social secularism ( which would otherwise be considered for the common good ) can not end well .
so tempmanoa are you saying that ignorance is an acceptable excuse for the potus .
are the pollster's still using the same methodology that said that trump had no pathway to 270 to become the next president ?
"sorry , emmanuel , but many people , with good cause , don't believe what the epa says ."
the epa kind of reminds me of the stickers that warn of cancer causing in the state of california .
everything is dangerous in enough quantity .
"the real , scientific question is what is the real danger of these leaks , flares and other plant operations ."
"let's see some scientific evidence or pragmatic proof that leak sniffing needs to be done each month , and not every two months , or that the levels released justify the expense ."
"based on experience with the them , i wouldn't put any weight at all on the epa's opinion ."
the truth is the epa runs off bureaucratic protocol .
"my interaction with them has not been in enforcement , either; i have no ax to grind with them specifically ."
"it is just that this is most likely a waste of money that , in the end , comes out of our pocket as consumers , and serves no benefit to anyone except some bureaucrats in the epa ."
the democratic party hates white folks ?
says the democratic party hates non-whites .
you right wingers need to get your story straight .
"sad , there are animals walking around who can fire a weapon ."
hope they are caught and dealt with severely .
there was a time when they might have given a serious lesson .
"now , it is more like a slap on the wrist so no lesson is learned  the large corporations and wealthy business people who pay off politicians to pass legislation that make them much wealthier are the 'real takers' ."
we need to put an end to the 'real takers' by getting rid of those government profiteers .
"both parties are guilty of this practice , though not necessarily equally guilty ."
brian schatz is a strategic thinker and planner and has demonstrated he works with republicans who have a different perception of the same problem .

hirono's term is up in 2019 and i will be happy to see her go .
the trump administration is doing everything they can do ensure there will be another terrorist attack .
have you somehow missed the many warnings by national security experts that the holy war on islam ratchets up the threat ?
remember how the bush 43 admin played right into osama bin laden's hands by invading a country that had nothing to do with 911 ?

wu reported her son's condition to the appropriate mental health authorities to ensure that he wasn't able to purchase a firearm .

i just have to say it is refreshing to read a g&m reporter provide an account of the game than a news service .
a great account of the game .
i would add that the leafs were not fazed by the weak goal .

they seemed to have the game at hand after their second goal .
they were tired but in control as displayed in handling the 5 on 3 disadvantage in the third period .

"all people who participate in journalistic contexts , should work in the open and disclose all significant conflicts of interest ."
"oppegaard , how do you suggest a commenter should do that when such disclosure would take up a significant portion of the 500-character length limit civil beat imposes on comments ?"
"personally , i have zero conflicts ( not paid by and not speaking on behalf of any company or organization ) , so for me such disclosure is not an issue ."
"for me the issue is that the length limit makes it impossible to adequately explain my position on a complex controversial topic , and the fact that your new peer review system allows a handful of radicals who disagree with me to censor and remove some of my comments which they label as uncivil merely to get them erased ."
and the manufacture of body bags .
"inside the mind of a trump voter: according to chip , us steel: • didn't care how sloppy his work ethic was , • did terrific things for him , • did chip no favors ."
"people who fall on hard times have things when that happens , so she went and got the dust off her tent and set it up ."
maybe she lives in that tent .
"good god , i've seen those and other sites like them pure alt-right horse sh*t ."
"why not add infowars , or are they still too busy chasing pizzagate ?"
"according to the article , potus has no legal authority to order wiretaps ."
"have these fake sites got a workaround for that , or do they just assume that if the doj ordered taps , that the kenyay muslim gun-grabbing anti-american terrorist loving tyrant must be behind it ?"
we're all eagerly awaiting pruitt to gut the epa .
"they brought it on themselves with their sue-and-settle practices to skirt oversight and have been in bed with radical environmentalists for years , and created dozens of scandals ."

com/2016/01/13/epa-lost-two-years-worth-of-emails-for-employee-who-colluded-to-kill-pebble-mine/ or how about when the epa was caught playing fast and loose to promote an agenda instead of hard science ?

there's an appalling amount of overreach and illegal maneuvers by zealots within the epa that needs to be corrected asap .
the epa is demonstrably corrupt and it needs a top-to-bottom overhaul .
fire everyone there and start fresh .
"maybe , but in many cases substance abuse is actually self medication for existing mental illness ."

"i'm not naive enough to believe the lies that emanate from breitbart , and this lie about cnn is worthy of trump and breitbart ."
"however , steve bannon was the ceo of breitbart , and he is the ceo of the trump campaign; and bannon is a well-known white supremacist and anti-semite ."
"trump has run a filthy , racist campaign from the get-go , and bannon serves as the guarantee to his racist base that , when the campaign is over , he will remain true to those racist roots ."

what a brilliant idea - using church property to provide a service to the community and provide sustainable income for the church .
it's too bad the diocese denied st .

"as a former catholic who is now a member of the united church of christ ( formerly congregational ) , i can say that we , at least , know where our money goes ."

"independent for now , who will always vote for #neverthecrazy# first , constitutionalist second ."
"what threatens western society , as in muslim countries like iran , is islamic extremists ( one day in the future ) taking control by force and subjugating the majority ( as in iran ) and cutting off our heads if we keep listening to music ."
those with actual negotiation experience will not interpret mr harper's comments the way you have .
you will find hundreds of references to this vile practice that is widely used by them against infidels .

the church needs to learn it is not god .

not all christians see the bible as the same .

lithia motors enjoys obvious economies of scale that local dealers have a hard time competing with - lithia is in effect a wholesaler selling to the public .
lithia can easily adjust operations to accommodate an additional 2 .
"5% cost , and still enjoy those economies of scale profitably ."

"i don't think lithia will pull up stakes in oregon , why would they ?"

the raid on the fund is going to drain it pretty quickly since it only made 1% last year .
"even with this raid on the fund , an income tax , a tire tax , 3x fuel tax there is still not enough to fix the budget ."
"the government needs $5 , 000 from every alaskan ."
the only way to fix the budget is to get our fair share of revnue on our oil as robin brena explains simply requiring the producers to pay us our historic fair share would increase revenues by roughly $3 billion under current conditions http://www .
com/opinions/2016/07/03/alaskans-fair-share-of-petroleum-revenue/ and how to fix it ( 1 ) increase the base rate for the major legacy fields ( 2 ) eliminate credits ( 3 ) eliminate loss carryforwards ( 4 ) eliminate the new oil 5 ) increase progressivity .
6 ) add the auditing and legal resources necessary ( 7 ) increase transparency https://www .

"but at my last job we penciled out both ways , in house and contracting ."
4 jobs for what a contractor charged for one .
every third job was free if we did it by those numbers .
"the state has a baked in cost advantage of about 40 percent - no taxes paid on profit and no profit needed , just get the job done ."
"kicker ice is that a contract carries a ~12 percent management penalty , ie the state has to spend about 12% of the contract cost managing it - accounting , oversight , deliverables actually delivered ."
"when i worked at the state , we could put a phone on a desk for $14/month ."
the vendor that won the contract immediately doubled that number .
( the contract also failed in less than two years another story .

"van jones on trump: 'he became president of the united states in that moment , period' it cannot be a reference to raymond cardinal burke as he is not a knight ."

funny thing is i hope the the new health care also does not go through .
i want it to collapse on the democrats .
the insurance companies that caused the health care crisis will either straighten up or bankrupt .
no one can afford either current plan .
only non earners with free medicade benefit from either .
this has nothing to do with murkowski being a liar .
"once she has abandoned her party commitments her days are numbered as a senator , kind of like what has happened to the democratics once they became a party of liars ."
she voted for repeal when she knew obama wouldn't sign but now she won't .
the world's superior health care systems are all hybrid public private health care systems so is ours and getting more private with each year .
it's death by a thousand cuts .
the private public partnerships ( p3s ) are more expensive and have corruption and fraud that follows along with them .

the best anyone can do for afghanistan is stop invading it .
"the pakistanis , on the other hand , are afghans cousins ."
india is pakistan's enemy and probably trying to destabilize afghanistan .

the liberals are so bull headed and it has been shown since they were elected .
it has cost tax payers billions of dollars .
all this liberal member has to do is change one word in this motion to have every canadian on board but no they have to single out islam .
the un had a similar motion it was finally agreed upon to remove the word islamaphobia .
anything to do with putting one religion above another or signaling them out whether in a good way or a bad way is just not tolerable .
this is why their is such wide spread reaction .
"our diversity makes us stronger only when everyone is equal , the liberals don't seem to realize that ."
the discussion around m103 has served as something of a catalyst .
it's opened a pandora’s box of broader questions and concerns about islam in canada that can’t be neatly put back togeth mahalo nui anita hofschneider and civil beat for shining a light on the true costs of the us militaryʻs pacific pivot .
there is so much in this report that resonates - with what hawaiʻi has been subjected to historically and today and what the peoples of the cnmi are now facing as well .

i don't think it's about the current level of emergency services being offered by the state .
it has to do with foundation programs and operating budgets that doubled in response to 100/bbl oil and one time federal stimulus funds .
there is no reason why our state can't go back to a 6 .
5 billion dollar overall budget and maintain current level of emergency services .
stripping earnings from the permanent fund and the capability of the alaska workforce to sustain a 9 .

"or something wrong with a religion that has already sent people into a church to cut the throat of a priest while he gave mass , and therefore , the need for catholic self defense ."
but i forgot: progressives are blind to history .
some of you white folks just can't get by with out the help of black folks .
you needed us for 400 years to turn a profit here .
"if this were really a capitalist nation , white folks would have to pay for that help ."
most white folk refuse to pay for that help .
i guess socialism works for white folks when it is based on racial discrimination .
some white folks just can't take responsibility for their choices .
they act like the are victims of race based slavery .
how did black folks keep you from volunteering to support the xmas parade ?
there is so much demand for housing in toronto due to immigration and natural population growth of the residents .
but there is no more land available to build new homes due to the restrictions placed on expansion .
so to solve the problem the govt must either stop immigration completely and bring in a one child policy like in china or remove the green belt and allow the city to expand .
people who support trump lack critical thinking skills .
"gary mason should dust off his notes from the bc rail affair which is when bc's lobbying industry was exposed in detail; though not by the national media which scrupulously avoided investigating all that came to light in the pre-trial hearings of the basi-virk case and before corrupt lobbyists including a prone-to-sue one who sues if his name is mentioned as collecting lobbying payments from bc rail , cn *and* the province all at once , completely illegally his misreporting of the basi-virk trial evaded any such investigation in general the national media has played the role of suppressor , not investigator including investigations of payback for donations such as the 'gift' of the fast ferries to the washington group of seattle likewise the southern railway , and how it was that enron/anderson consulting came to own the management end of bc hydro , more could be said if not for the g&m's limits on posting lenth took you a long time for you to smell the coffee mr mason regarding:“ms ."
"hammond’s allegation that snap has abandoned its survivor outreach work is highly uninformed , if not malicious and defamatory , ” said kruger , alleging herself that hammond raised the suit “for personal promotion and financial gain four years after she separated from snap ."
” - in these circumstances it is always wise to ask: who is the driver of this lawsuit ?
"- is there a consortia of 'pure catholic church' types , be they episcopates or lay , who have inspired and impelled this lawsuit with accusations of organizational behaviour on the part of snap that could not be said to be illegal , much less unethical ?"
the komen foundation is more about keeping cash flowing then fighting a sincere good fight against breast cancer .
politcal groups and terrorist groups are not protected .
"it does not matter that they are offensive or not , not one has to make politcal or terrorist cakes ."
it is ridiculous to think they do .
it is ridiculous to think they do .
that's why i never said they were .
i am talking about an individual as i pointed out quite clearly in my previous post .
if you want a picture of john lennon on a specialty cake that does not make you a beatle .
it makes you a beatles fan .
and the argument can be made that gay marriage is offensive to a whole lot of people because it fails to pass in one of the most liberal states in the union again and again .
before the supreme court decision gay marriage was legal in like 3 or 4 of the 50 states .
the little guy muslims have been accused in attacks on many countries .
usually labeled as home grown terrorists .
"however in every case where a muslim has attacked a country , such as the us , britain , france , spain , canada , germany those countries had attacked muslims ."
"muslims were attacked in many countries especially in palestine and afghanistan , iraq , libya and now syria ."
"it suggests that if the west had not gone into the middle east and environs , killing , the western countries would not have been attacked ."
please point to a large scale open pit mine that has not caused irreparable damage to the environment .
mine owners have been required to provide a bond to insure reclamation after the nine labs out .
"and second , reclamation is a term of art and quite different from restoration ."
reclamation means to make the property usable .
restoration means to make it as it was before the mine .
"so no matter what , the property is never going to be as it once was ."
and reclamation is what pebbke promises .
"a variety of ethnicities and religions so this dude was screaming out against catholics , jews , mormons , protestant , lutherans , christians , etc ."
"john badman , hopefully this home-grown red-neck didn't speak out against your religion , if you have one !"
maybe we can all assimilate into your religion ?
"god knows , we don't want to be different ."
brexit is big enough to trigger a new vote .
"i support my white culture - i introduce people from different cultural backgrounds to the food , music , literature , etc of my history ."
"it has never included suprematism , violence , subrogation of others in order to keep and share my white culture ."
"these people are not trying to keep their white culture , they are trying to actively suppress other cultures and pretend it's about keeping their own ."
"i don't do anything that i would be ashamed or worried about my face being identified and broadcast to family , friends , employers or general public ."
colleges and universities should embrace diversity of thought and allow the speech of those that happen to disagree with the majority .
"instead , opposition speech is shut down and speakers are threatened with violence ."
trump was a reality show actor the lowest grade of actor  i don't make up rules .
i just adhere to those dictated by common sense and agreed upon by civilized people .
"as everyone but you , apparently , understands , changing screen names is different than changing shirts because one is intentionally misleading and the other isn't ."
"unless , of course , your habit is to wear your shirt over your face , which i wouldn't put past you ."
you can drone on all you like about divine love and family and all your other greatest hits .
"but as long as you insist on playing these silly little games , which betray disrespect for the people on these boards , nobody of substance will take you seriously ."
required union membership is negotiated in the union contract under the clause of closed shop .
"i don't get why people who choose to work in a closed union shop late , like dick , bash organized labor for collective bargaining pay raises , bennies , and retirement ."
the anti-union crowd want something for nothing .
if you don't like or support organized labor then stay the hell out of those workplace environments .
union need a strong workforce that has respect and supports what the union does for them .
what the hell are you talking about ?
"you are now against a statue of our blessed mother holding her son jesus , on the top of a cathedral ?"
"what a joke , i could find more catholic beliefs on an atheist site ."
"there will probably be some kind of al smith dinner in twenty years , but it's highly unlikely the presidential candidates will still attend ."
the catholic demographic is declining numerically and the influence of the church over catholic voting patterns is already very slight .
"like it or not , catholic prelates in the us should begin preparing for a time when their phone calls to the secular powers go unanswered ."
the potus has a sharp eye for perceived enemies and is quick to point out the most camouflaged ones on twitter if he deems them worthy of criticism .
"but when the enemy is a threat to the american constitution and is parading its colours nakedly , he can't seem to discern the obvious enemy from the rest of the crowd ."
last week it would have required a healthy dose of cynicism to speculate that the likes of david dukes and the kkk get sympathy from trump .
"now that mainstream american politicians are pointing out what has become obvious , it's fair to say that trump does have room in his heart for their own un-american sympathies without being cynical ."
the part i do not understand is that our society and the laws that we live by are based on christianity .
"basically , live right or you will be punished ."
"if we did not have these laws , our way of life as we know it would cease and lawlessness would prevail ."
"i can see allowing prayers from all of the major religious faiths as they all espouse the good and reject evil , but to allow pro evil goes against the nature of government ."
we can't allow it at a meeting of a governing body .
that is the argument that the government should have used to prevent this .
"satan has no laws and thus , no place in our society ."
"from day one it was apparent that her task was not to protect the public , but to endorse dirty governance ."
she offers as much protection to the public as a loincloth would in an ice age .
the worst is yet to come .
"ce: seriously , read what you wrote: the real victims are people who did not get harassed and raped ."
"strange thinking , in my view ."
"not true , jerusalem was jewish 2000 year before it was seized in bloody massacre by islam's genocide armies ."
the entire middle east had been roman and then christian 500 years muhammad married his 6-year-old bride .
it was islam and mohammed who invaded and destroyed centuries of western states .
"constantinople , syria , and jordan were all christian and the crusades were failed attempts to take back what was rightfully western from the forces of bloody conquest and death ."
"long overdue , but just about whatever it takes to get more lanes added is good news ."
everything else about this disaster of a potus is fake .
where in the bible did jesus christ condemn homosexuals ?
he's probably shaking his head every time he sees people using his name to promote discrimination against a certain class of humanity .
and this is why the socialist left never said a word when isis and the taliban desecrate buddhist statues and temples and blow up christian churches we need to rid ourselves of the scourge of liberal socialism immediately .
i demand the arrest of the socialist black bigot senator xbxtxch from missouri who is calling for the assassination of our president put her in jail now and shut down the islamic terrorist sympathizers in the media .
i too appreciate the work of mr .
evans these last two and half years .
"one correction to a previous assertion of mine , is the study is not the 2015 ipsos affluent survey , as i had assumed , but is a separate solicited research project that ipsos carried out in fall 2015 ."
"i notice that , beyond the russian propaganda sites , you never provide any backup , links , evidence , to support your wild claims ."
"i don't know , i would like a refund ."
"what is your proof and how has $50 , 000 , 000 stolen gone undetected ?"
"if you are just crying about costs , get some senators in there that are willing to overhaul our broken health care system ."
"terrorism is terrorism , why do you condone it ?"
"maybe , saudi arabia , egypt , united arab emirates and bahrain are agreeing with u ."
president trump's request for muslim countries to help fight islamic terrorism .
maybe qatar should stop supporting islamic terrorists .
shouldn't iran want qatar to stop supporting islamic terrorists ?
a psychologist once told me that i would be bowled over at how many people suffer from mental illness in various forms .
a priest from america who has travelled the world said that south africans are in his opinion one of the most stressed nations on earth .
also not difficult to dispute that .
these were both many years ago around 12 perhaps .
a disaster from start to finish .
"decades showing the exponentially increase of blatant toxicity by republican efforts says differently , and as bad as dems have performed here we all should be extremely grateful the cons never had the upper hand in far away hawaii or we'd be even worse off than kansas , illinois , or most other con-trolled states who are now decimated by these nasty gov's and minions ."
''hope'' in regards to the current admin .
"is like russian roulette , not good to even consider ."
he keeps saying muslim ban when the word muslim never appears in the orders .
why let a little thing like the actual wording get in the way of a good outrage ?
i have said many times that scotus will decide the issue .
let's sit back and watch the news commentators turn red with rage while trying to use twisted logic to explain their view while ignoring the facts in front of them .
not sure if something else was discovered during the examination that contributed to their finding .
there is such a thing as privacy .
"whether these people were canadian or not , having a muslim heritage , they should have anticipated that there could be push back at the u ."
"with what's going with the muslim ban and all , as a canadian i would not be planning a trip south anytime soon ."
he's trying to justify the officers actions and the subsequent cover-up by laying blame for the officers actions onto the cultural struggles of the accused .
this is a textbook police response when they are trying to change the narrative .
it only took him three months to finally remembering he has constituents that don't write checks for his re-election campaign .
and an apology is due for a staffer's anti-catholic joking .
"moreover , hillary's pro-abortion stance , including third trimester abortion or , should i say baby-killing , is deplorable ."
"well the value of the minerals ( i know you mean oil and gas ) is zero until they are out of the ground because until then , you don't know with certainty if anything is down there ."
we have nearly a million recorded ounces of gold a year leaving this state .
more than enough to have our own gold standard .
strong central banking is what truly drives a stable economy .
local investment private investment with alaskan owned banks backed by alaska gold .
there are genius type money people among us that could with the infrastructure we already have by way of the permanent fund and the alaska constitution set us on a bullet proof course .
get the monster gas line project whacked back into being an alaskan energy provider for our own economy and residential heat source for a long and productive future .
we need the feds for our military defense and large transportation infrastructure but we need ourselves for building a busy profitable economy by our own gold .
canadians just don't quite get it yet .
we've been very lucky and had a great pm to get us where we are .
but we are a beaver in bed next to an elephant .
if the elephant is in a good mood fine .
"hello mark shore , you might want to re-read my post , clearly you did not understand it when you read it the first time ."
"i commented on the crowds in that street who were white , as was abundantly evident in the photos and video clips released at the same time as the article ."
"the question that i posed was about the article's reporting on the crowds in that street , where i clearly asked: given that this is a racially charged scenario , why is the newspaper not mentioning that the car plowed into a street lined with crowds that appear to be , um , white people ?"
why are you focusing on the driver ?
"i never questioned the reporting on the driver , i questioned the reporting on the crowds in the photos and video ."
"blacks will not get special treatment , they will be treated equally ."
equality isn't always what they wanted .
i would also tear into any elected official that claims the election is false .
"the mainstream media , at the expense of country's future , are trying to sow doubt about the results of the election because of their bigotry against christians , farmers , and those that voted for trump ."
i would spare no mercy in attacking these enemies of democracy if i were trump as well .
the ndp are in the works to join the liberal party .
you need to wake the hell up .
google george soros for christ sake .
i don't think one has to believe the text is literally true in order to conclude that the argument made in this essay is specious .
both michael and the monsignor state that catholic social teaching is grounded in the hebrew scriptures and they make the mistake of attributing the exodus account to the supposed exilic period .
"the hebrew scriptures include a number of texts that speak of welcoming the stranger , but scholars agree they refer to fellow hebrews ."
"the same scriptures portray the hebrews as conquering and annihilating neighboring peoples , which you correctly point out is neither historical nor deriving from the exilic period ."
"so there is no basis for their argument , which is just fine with me ."
i think it's perfectly reasonable to state that catholic social teaching has developed into what it is and we're all committed to it as the basis for our reflections on justice .
dragging in mythical figures and stories adds nothing to the argument .
it is a putin and trump bonanza .
and some of rorate caeli's sources are openly anti-semitic .
"com/blogs/feastofeden/2013/04/traditionalists-expert-on-pope-francis-is-holocaust-denier/ especially those liberal progressives who tweet angrily in the middle of the night about comedians and magazines , and then don't bother to go to intelligence briefings because they're so smart - they're a real riot ."
so she looks like she's about 8 years old .
how does she know she's gay ?
like obama didn't offer arms to saudi arabia ?
where was the outrage in september of 2016 when he offered a $100 bn arms deal to saudi arabia ?
when obama accepted bling from saudi royalty and bowed down before saudi royalty ?
i don't remember hearing much outrage from the op-ed section back then .
the peaks of american hypocrisy were reached well before trump's dealings with sa .
"tax hater asks , corruption as bad as harper ."
why is it impossible to find an honest government ?
"it starts in the local riding association , often a group of municipal politicians of various sorts a mayor/councilors/school board trustees/the local dog catcher , local business association members , local high profile/connected residents , a lawyer or two , representatives from a couple of community charity clubs essentially the kind of people who come up on the street and shake hands forever asking themselves , how can my knowing you benefit me ?"
"why do offspring and other family members of former politicians end up in politics caplan , chiarelli , clement , copps , crosbie , fulton , dewar , ignatieff , jackman , layton , lewis , mackay , manning , mcguinty , nixon , notley , o'toole , peterson , rae , trudeau and yakabuski to name but a few coincidence ?"
you have more faith in the public opinion than i do kathy .
"either 1 ) the public isn't , or can't be , well informed on business practices 2 ) very few of the public vote and no 'consensus' can be known ."
( do 50% of eugene's eligible votes turn out for local votes ?
what you get is a pretense of a 'public' referendum that is actually a display of a minority activist group .
"( activist on either end of political ideology , but that's mostly liberal in eugene ) ."
"sometimes the pretense of being 'for the people' , is just serving the opposite cause , rewarding active special interest ."
i like oregon's moves to make registration and voting easier and more widespread .
i'm not sure results are confirming it turns out more voters yet ?
"we completely agree that a public utility should remain public , not sold to private interest ."
"the fault is clearly the officer's , or his training ."
"on a stop involving a missing taillight , the first mistake was going up to the car with gun out ."
and what don't you get about black lives matter ?
it means exactly all lives matter .
"i love the poor attempt to spin it into a anti-racial attempt , but you can't ignore racism in this country , and you can't have all lives matter without having black lives matter too ."
"and if gardner's position is strong and backed by so many , how come he doesn't hold a public meeting and bask in your adulation ?"
have you been watching the news ?
any attempt at a public hearing is shouted down and consist of lot of yelling and screaming .
"cory is not scamming the majority he is doing exactly what he was elected to do , repeal obamacare ."
trump does pay taxes you could watch rachael maddog show when she had his taxes .
there is no up side for trump to release his taxes returns .
"there is nothing to retire , it's a fact ."
"i am the same as your child born here from immigrant parents , i am a proud first generation canadian from immigrant parents , like everyone here we were/are from immigrants at one point ."
"pendahoo is a racist , by saying toronto is 52% foreign he means not white ."
i'm white btw and he's still a racist .
we are bidding farewell to a moment that represented the entirety of the u .
population in a way the coming era never can .
the results of the past election provides evidence that this was not the case .
the obama administration perhaps represented the views of the enlightened urban population and the liberal arts educated media that serve as their voice .
but the polls have proven that the american population as a whole was not represented as the majority by their government .
"bernie sanders won the popular vote for the democratic primaries , but was not anointed by the great and powerful obama and the democratic party brain trust and did not get the nomination ."
"the pollsters did not see the trump win , but only because they didn't bother to venture beyond the great city limits that provided the answers to the polls that they were seeking ."
this fact was brought to light by a few brave pollsters themselves .
the counties mood was reflected by the elections outcome .
"in the early years of christianity , people joined the way , because it had a meaningful application to their lives ."
you confident and joyful catholic identity of the jpii and benedict years clearly has not resulted in any stabilization in the numbers of the catholic church in the so-called first world countries .
"rather than laying the blame at the feet of those who are leaving , perhaps some soul-searching might be in order ."
"there is no need for her to apologize , she spoke academically factually ."
"as is so often the case , i truly enjoy listening to the words of francis ."
"and as is equally often the case , i doubt his words will come to fruition , at least in my life and the life of my children ."
"all of this go slow , and it takes time to change something this big talk is fine , as long as one is willing to essentially sacrifice the lives of so many who will never live to see what good ( if any ) comes of all of this ."
"this concept of ignoring the present , and focusing on some unobtainable future is part of why there was and is so much anger over the scandal , the promised tribunal ( s ) , the commission , etc there is a clock ticking , and people will do what our biology requires: we will die ."
does the church owe anything to the currently living ?
"somewhere buried in that question , and the answers , are some pretty deep questions about the nature of the church , and whether this was what jesus had in mind , both in the way he lived , and also in what he said  i think you can draw a straight line from the 2011 white house correspondents' dinner , when obama mocked trump over trump's racist birther drivel , to trump's candidacy and , god help us , to his presidency ."
i think not canadians see what is happening in france and england as a result of immigration and refugees .
"parallel lives refers to cultures that move into a country , live physically in that a country , but obey their own laws and culture , with no intent of integrating into the laws and culture of that country ."
be zdf - islam - effects on germani the presidency of george w .
bush left us with two wars which he did not pay for and an economy that was crashing as he left office .
"i think history will judge that bush allowed dick cheney , arguably both the most consequential and easily the worst vice president in history , to have too much power and influence , at least for the first six years ."
"however , this much must be said in gwb 's favor , and from our current perspective it's more important now than it was when he was president: while waging war on terror ( however misguided it was ) , w never yielded to the language , the rhetoric of religious bigotry ."
"he did not wage war on islam or on muslims , but on terror and terrorists ."
"there is very little , square surface area in hawaii , compared to all of the continents ."
"there is very few resources ( like water ) , in hawaii , compared to all of the continents ."
"you can only make so much money in hawai'i , with hawaii's limited geography & resources ."
"america will become a joke down the road , but that is american's choice , i really don't care ."
the tv weather hype on local news channels are a waste of our time .
"you do understand it's the republicans that caused the recession , right ?"
so why should i listen to any republican can .
they don't know how to do anything but spend money we don't have and destroy what we do have .
"wayne , how about supporting black criminals instead of the police , supporting the sharpton group who does nothing for the black community , pushing obamacare down the throats of 67% of the american people against their wishes , and on and on and on county revenue grows with economic growth ."
there doesn't seem to be considered in the county government and to date the port of grays harbor seems to be leading the way in economic growth .
"candidate nichols , so far , is the only supportive voice i hear in this political forum ."
"referring such responsibilities to an independent agency , as the greater grays harbor , llc does not fully satisfy or encourage new economic growth ."
"mighty , the pfd dole program should go away ."
i do however think you should get every pfd dole check from the beginning .
"that's the problem with government dole , you have to suck up to the government to get it ."
the fifth and fourteenth amendments protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged .
"sunshine , maybe you should read up on the constitution ."
maybe you could refrain from passing judgement until you have proof beyond a reasonable doubt .
of course you worship the fakenews .
com god so that may be too much to ask .
"just saying  when mccain did photo ops with syrian muslim terrorists , mccain showed he cares little if at all about americans ."
"one thing is clear - i think our experts , who have been confounded about the astronomical housing prices in vancouver in the past , and their decoupling from wages and the local economy , haven't a clue where price and demand is heading ."
"hmmmmm1 , yes your feelings count ."
feelings however are what we don't base rational decisions on .
"unless there are measurable reasons why a transgendered person couldn't be an effective contributing member of the forces , then there's no reason not to allow them to enlist ."
there are thosands of scientists who do not want to associate with ipcc and other thosands muzzled .
thousands of unconnected people and hundreds of millions of dollars bingo !
governments will spend with no cap in grants to research that proves their agenda of milking the stupid and will ridicule any findings not in line with the consensus .
as far as i am concerned the pope is plain vanilla communist who does all he can to ridicule the church and make it irrelevant .
"this ban should have happened a lot sooner , but the democrats lacked both spine and political will ."
"in addition , their refusal to enforce security along the us-mexico border and overall disdain for working class america was completely unacceptable ."
breathtaking gains have been made in the treatment and surgical treatment of chd ( congenital heart disease ) .
i am only here because of pioneering heart surgery in 1958 .
good for kimmel; he took the moment to plead for accessibility to - life .
let's be clear what that means; a child who will die is provided the opportunity to live a full life .
"this is as clear cut an issue as it can be , and certainly a strong argument for universal health coverage ."
i've been doing some serious soul searching about this whole issue and i've come to the conclusion that whining that the oil lobby is only paying 85% of our local government's budget and concluding that they need to pay the other 15% is ludicrous .
where are we going to find the other 85% when there isn't an oil industry ?
that is the question that seems lost here .
"the pfd program is the only logical solution to a long term problem that no one seems willing to acknowledge that alaska's future , at the moment , looks pretty bleak ."
"the cat-nutters have invaded alaska  doug: ya , and if his business did not deflate , he would have to go into the emergency room and get a shot in his business to relieve the pressure ."
"have a buddy who just had to have that done  actually , when you do your homework as opposed to repeating things that scratch your ear these fires occurred every year before white folks showed up ."
"in fact , us injuns used to start these fires to clear the grasses before nature started the fires when the fuels had built up as we now allow them to do ."
"furthermore , the pacific region has always dealt with the effects of el nino and la nina , we have always had droughts followed by massive rains the cycle continues ."
"what if we have catch a cat days , annually at first , where residents are encouraged to capture strays and take them into humane society and other cat-friendly organizations and participating vets for free spaying and neutering ?"
pet stores can perhaps provide cardboard carriers for those who don't have .
those with notched ears could be taken to centralized collection areas for transport to humane societyʻs facility in hawaiʻi kai etc .
"by letting the city and county and state provide some incentives to those participating , perhaps all involved will feel it as a win-win ."
"i hate seeing all these poor animals , most of which appear to be domestic cats , abandoned and left to propagate on the streets ."
"personally , i would love to participate in such a round up ."
i think a lot of us animal lovers would !
i'm willing to kokua such an effort on the west side - where lack of proximity to resources leaves abandoned animals without much of a chance of adoption .
"people rant and rave about cars and pollution or coal plants and pollution but no one seems to care about the amount of pollution that 1 container ship puts on as it crosses the ocean bringing parts for an electric car , or mining tools for a lithium mine ( also terrible for the environment ) ."
who cares about some accord that redistributes wealth so other countries that haven't figured out basic economic models can continue to screw the planet .
"if you want to save the earth , live in a tent , only eat what you produce , ride your bike , buy nothing but what is produced locally , and support nuclear energy ."
this means having nothing that is labeled made in china since buying said goods means you directly funded a container ship .
this is what it's all about and it will only have cost canadians untold billions to get the little egotist his worthless seat .
the nccm is the same group that provided input to the tdsb that resulted in a definition of islamaphobia calling any criticism of islamic culture or politics islamaphobic - the tdsb called it an accident right .
"assertive political islam is a threat to canadian values of gender equality , freedom of expression , and freedom of sexual orientation - they encourage regressive cultural practices that are synonymous with authoritarian regimes all over the world , without exception ."
"in canada the niqab is about freedom and modesty but everywhere else in the world , it must be worn under penalty of lashings or worse , go figure ."
the reason the niqab is not common in canada is because canada has evolved into a modern civilized progressive country .
"the niqab is only common in countries that are regressive , misogynist , and authoritarian - there are no exceptions ."
"canada isn't different than countries with the niqab , canada is civilized , period ."
perhaps some sympathy should be shown for those who fight these wars .
war is prosecuted for economic gain and those who benefit do not send their own children to serve .
"those who enter the services mostly lack the opportunity to better themselves as a result of poverty , lack of education and ignorance ."
they buy into sophisticated military advertising that promises not only a career but a meaningful life only to find that after discharge they are forgotten and neglected .
call those who serve sheep if you must but it is the herders that need to be held to account fema is hardly a right wing program .
hmmmm so who'll do the groping !
"a little bit of both , in florida , but mostly catholics moving south ."
"many catholics with disposable incomes are active and give generously while many young families , anglo- and latino , are joining parishes , getting involved because they like what they see ."
"parishes i visited in orlando , naples and tampa are booming ."
"the real challenge for all christian churches , however , is attracting the non-affiliates ."
"churches are great at sheep hustling from each other , whether intentionally ( as among some evangelical churches ) or unintentionally; but us christianity in general still stays the same low percentage -- 70% , especially with southern baptists reporting continual declines ."
i personally think catholicism benefits from a heavily evangelical population owing to the latter's active church participation and financial commitment to their churches .
"catholics mimic them , as it were ."
but evangelicals are declining in many parts .
who are the ruthless and uncaring rightists to whom you refer ?
are they the christians who feed people or the baptists and salvation army organizations currently helping thousands recover from hurricane losses ?
"are they the tough-love folks who think able-bodied people who receive government handouts should be subject to workfare , not absolutely free fare ?"
are they those who think that individuals--not big bureaucratic government--are best able to decide who gets their charitable donations ?
are they the poor black church-going folks in the inner-cities who are clamoring for more charter schools and praying to win the lotteries to get their children into non-government schools ?
perhaps you are simply channeling margaret thatcher's liberal media critics or swallowing the fear-mongering served up by schumer and others of his ilk .
"why , just this week , he forgot to say how republicans what to throw grandma off a cliff ."
one thing is for sure: you haven't been to austin lately .
"in reality , i couldn't care less what you think ."
"all i know is i never had to pay anything out of pocket worth mentioning until recently , when suddenly i'm writing checks in the hundreds and thousands ."
it seems to me that it is both fair and important to recognize this action for what it is .
there is a whole branch of the church i love who honestly believe that they have been called by god to refine and purify the adventist church - and that until that occurs we will never reach the level of purity that is necessary for us to finish the work so that jesus can return .
"people like ted wilson , stephen bohr , doug bachelor and many others in their particular camp sincerely long for the shaking to occur so that the latter rain can be poured out and we can all go to heaven ."
"in pursuit of that goal , this and other things that are in the works are something that they are intentionally doing to purify the church and to shake out anyone not in line with their particular view of adventism ."
i think that most dispassionate observers can clearly recognize that this carefully considered and calculated move is the opening salvo in what promises to be a catastrophic series of events !
rail will end at middle st cause there will be no more money from the feds and the voters will not stand for another tax increase .
"part 2 ( see below ) a parable garrett hardin wrote , among other things , an ecolate view of the human predicament ( see online ) ."
he explains an essential law of nature--of god's creation--the carrying capacity of the land .
in it he includes a parable from nature--the parable of st .
matthew island--a brief example of carrying capacity .
"is off the coast of alaska ( yes , that's its real name !"
during wwii reindeer were left there as an emergency source of food .
"there were no predators to control the population and the deer were left , forgotten ."
they multiplied to 6000 and then one winter the population collapsed .
overpopulation results in environmental degradation and then starvation .
and remember the previous warnings--malthus explained the exponential math of population growth .
"and in the bible , in revelations , the 4 horses of the apocalypse reveal what humans already knew--famine , epidemics , war and early death are population control of nature ."
"these should not have been laicized , imo , or allowed to resign , but sent to an island ( or other place of isolation ) to live out the remainder or their lives ."
"that's no solution because there is no , and never will be any [isolated] fantasy island to sequester these sexual predators ."
"for all their deep flaws and failings [i understand how dangerous incarcerated life can be] , prisons are the only safe place to house these sexual predators ."
"during my time on the sf review board , the archdiocese purchased a building on california street hoping to warehouse all their sexual predators ."
the problem was that archbishop could never find any competent individuals willing to supervise these criminals in an after-care situation .
"my idea: convert one of these closed or under-used , fairly rural seminary properties to house priest predators - supervised by the very hierarchs who for years have been complicit in the abuse and sexual assault of priests on children ."
white people need to sit down and listen or something along those lines  to wit: i posted the comment below in a thread that is now closed .
"it may be a cliche , but some of my best friends the folks we've been hearing from here are not catholic traditionalists ."
"they use some catholic words and concepts , but they do not know , understand or believe the tradition ."
"when they try to sing a catholic tune , they are off-key ."
these are the characteristics of religious fundamentalism across various religions and denominations .
"fundamentalism is , in many respects , not so much a theological deviancy ( although it is that ) but a psychological deviancy ."
"> yes , that speaks volumes ."
i am sure little potato is too busy praising cuban and chinese dictators to worry about it .
"no one alive committed any of these offences and only a fool thinks reconciliation should be paid in dollars and cents it is ransom by imposed guilt and it's now a cottage industry that lives in perpetuity courtesy of those to weak to stand up for themselves because the live in fear of being called a racist , very sad ."
while none of us know exactly what happened and whether there has been any history of violence .
"in my opinion , this entire situation is an exemplification of how we ( state of alaska ) feel/value lthe elderly , veteran's , mental illness and the 2nd amendment all in one incident ."
"this is every child/grandchildsnightmare as they see their parent/grandparent grow old , while no one in the community is willing and able to help ."
"there are no easy answers , it's just sad ."
"yes , but add lack of supply to that as well ."
that is the most significant factor driving the prices up .
"i find it interesting that so many on the gop would force this on ppl , yet , it is the left wing that continues to push for funding to help these kids , while the right and far right want to cut off the families from help ."
and i have little doubt that mr .
lewis' family has made heavy use of gov aid .
cassie i have a friend who sent her daughter to stuebenville i happened to like both my friend and her daughter a lot but i would never have felt comfortable raising any controversial issue with them as they were truly saved and in the arms of jesus charismatics and steubenville was really the only safe place for them we send our kids to jesuit schools and state and private universities we debate everything it could be argued that we are adults  orthodox catholics are with our lord on this one .
it's funny how a singer's technical problems on new year's eve and a terrorist attack that killed 39 on new year's eve get about the same amount of attention in the media .
i'm sure it says more about humans as a species than anything else .
"several posters have provided the full quote , proving the fallacy of the right-wing's claim ."
"yet not surprisingly , you and other right-wing posters ignore the context of pelosi's comment , twisting it to an entirely different meaning ."
so where are all the unleashed scientists ?
"and if a basic dictatorship is you bag , you should pack yours and head off to be with your chinese friends ."
"bav , you may be proud to be a trump support as an anonymous poster , but have you told your family yet ?"
"don't worry , they'll still love you ."
let's see what you left out of canon 212: can .
"conscious of their own responsibility , the christian faithful are bound to follow with christian obedience those things which the sacred pastors , inasmuch as they represent christ , declare as teachers of the faith or establish as rulers of the church ."
they have a right to make their statements .
they did this two years ago .
their pastor and bishop did not see it their way .
"there is a canonical procedure they can follow , although with the picayune complaints i cannot imagine them getting what they apparently wish ."
"in exercising their rights , the christian faithful , both as individuals and gathered together in associations , must take into account the common good of the church , the rights of others , and their own duties toward others ."
all participants in their ordinations have been excommunicated .
"ah yes , the rich natives telling he poor natives not to stand against the pebble mine ."
hear this rich natives are taking advantage of natives the same way rich white people screw over white people .
think about how sophie minich makes her money and power .
"read the initiative , then make your choice ."
anecdotal evidence suggests no it doesn't .
it suggests that you're just making things up because you don't have any *actual* evidence for these claims .
it's not clear that when bannon said platform for the alt-right he was referring to the specific subset of white nationalists .
there is no indication that bannon himself is a white nationalist .
a more accurate term would be american nationalist .
"anti-immigration , anti-pc , anti-muslim , pro-jingoism ."
if this is racism then it's a specific *kind* of racism that was mainstreamed after 9/11 and describes the views of at least half the people in this country .
people respond by saying that islam is not a race and therefore it's not racism .
but it's no coincidence that we're bombing the crap out of a certain region and that this kind of foreign policy probably would not be tolerated if we were bombing all the terrorists in ireland or some eastern european country .
it's only acceptable because muslims are others .
"andrew , you have absolutely no sense of humor ."
these mishaps are way to out of the ordinary i feel these oil tankers and cargo ships are ramming our destroyers on purpose so it will be the captains fault even though it was hit in the left rear of the ship these ships are targeting us this many times is to suspicious .
sexting was/is as common as hell .
i hate its immorality and frankly think those who are into it deserve the problems it brings .
"i think however that in this case , the consensual part is what will play the important role ."
then do something about the deleteriousness of drugs and alcohol .
encourage lawmakers to provide more funding for treatment .
"when you tell kids how terrible it is when the evidence of their eyes tells them that's false , it says to them you lied about other drugs ."
"if you keep it out of the black market , kids won't come in contact with dealers who may not have any weed that day but has this stuff called smack ."
if you and the parrots below had your heads out of your butts you'd have read the books and articles over recent years that detailed just how such an attack could happen .
"don't need no stinkin icbm , a ship-borne , high altitude launch from the gulf of mexico could do it ."
"a high , mid-country detonation wouldn't kill many of us , but a year without electricity ( fuel , medicine , communications , computers , food , etc ."
) would -- about 90% of us .
"( btw , exactly how do you think wallyworld and your local grocery stores stock their shelves , by magic ?"
") for about as much foreign aid as we send to pakistan each year , we could largely fix our vulnerability to such an emp attack ."
"if they'd get off their sorry butts , we might be able to do just that before it's too late ."
sign me as one of the 90 percenters .
anyone bernie sanders supporter or not who would vote for clinton after all of this corruption has been exposed is totally insane .
"they tried to do it to bernie , they did it to bernie , conspired against him being jewish , taco bowl , racism and bigotry within the dnc , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , why do you not think that they are doing the same smear campaign on trump and you are buying it ?"
"remember when you were mad at your parents for not letting you do something that all of your friends were doing if all of your friends went and jumped off a cliff for fun and said that you have to do it too , would you do it too ?"
your parents were right don't do it .
"however , unlike many in her party clark is a true blue liberal ."
the rest of the party is certainly a right wing coalition ( anything but the ndp ) .
this whole election result just confirms the well known truth in b .
( for the 50 years i have been following politics anyway ) .
the spread between the ndp and the right wing party is extremely razor thin .
it was only the intervention of the greens to throw everything out of kilter .
"ivan has conducted some of the most statistically accurate polling in the state for decades , you can't make up your own reality and then judge other people's failure to adhere to your make-believe world of falsehoods , sorry ."
yes and your point is what about today ( it's 2017 ) ?
"no worry , if ige gets booted , he's gone ."
"no , i'm honestly not trying to rationalize ."
and i say this with sincerity .
vatican i explicitly taught that peter did not become the pope until after the resurrection .
so i did not make this up .
peter's threefold denial of christ ( and his being told get thee behind me etc ) all occurred prior to his becoming pope .
"jesus' threefold commission to peter regarding the sheep , seems to redeem or offset peter's threefold denial ."
where are they becoming more extreme ?
"and even if so , don't you agree that everyone is more extreme ?"
looks at the political viewpoint charts .
"over the past 30 years the right has moved way right , while the left has almost remained the same ."
political correctness is no worse/different now than 20 years ago .
"that landscape isn't changing , it's just that the right is pushing back more now and it's encouraging their folks to keep pushing ."
"but in reality , nothing has changed ."
"gay people have different sexual natures which is their own business , not yours ."
romans 2 - what you are doing is sinful .
because it's a much bigger problem that the liberal mass-media won't cover because of the political agenda .
in 2016 apx 250 blacks were killed by police nationwide .
the majority of those shootings were investigated and deemed justified .
"up to this point in 2017 , almost 480 people have been shot and killed in chicago and over 2200 have been wounded , the majority of he assaults being black on black ."
"cho , it's willful ignorance like yours that is a major contribution to this cultural downfall we are experiencing here in the u also if these are owned by working families with kids , how do they afford , property tax , upkeep of house , clothing , insurance , food , hydro costs , daycare if children , etc ."
i think his 5th avenue remark really drove home the existential truth about his base supporters .
"the subsequent release of the billy bush tape drove home the duplicity and rank cowardice of the gop in the face of trump's base , and it also proved once again , the base's willingness to accept that for them trump is not just above the law , but above any notion of common decency ."
what happened in charlotesville will be repeated and it will get uglier .
"we have not just trump's racist base to thank for that , but also white christian pro lifers who put potential life above above any sense of the national common good ."
"welfare queens always drop out in high school , that why two governors from valdez with a valedictorian card were paid $1 ."
"it's tough to pass math , reading comprehension , and 8th grade civics when you get it for free !"
do you dislike all white people .
you do realize it is the village of akiak made up of mostly alaska natives that is doing this .
so if i understand your feelings it is ok to do what you want because your native and white people should just follow what ever you want !
"just so you know i think he should leave the town and it's teacher housing ( when contract says ) i just don't believe you as a native have the right to being judge jury and executioner and banish anyone from an american town , village , or city to alleviate your problem and put it on someone else ."
stop hateing others and your life will improve .
this story just seems to get murkier and murkier by the day and it is very difficult to know what is truth and what is bs .
sadly the daily world story doesn't seem to make things any clearer .
can you clarify a bit more ?
senior doj officials are as corrupt as hillary and bill .
of course they wouldn't want comey to disclose the truth !
"as i read over my comments on this thread , i probably should have tempered them a bit ."
"nobody tempts me toward setting aside my christian charity as much as the current president , i'm afraid ."
i need to work on that .
"hope you never ble when the members of the usccb suddenly jolted their awareness into our current unpleasant trump reality , my first thought was how similar their 'dismay' and 'disappointment' etc ."
"was to captain renault in casablanca: i'm shocked , shocked to find that gambling is going on in here !"
trump is now what he has always been .
some voted for him in spite of it and some voted for him because of it it appears that our prelates are not just trying to climb out of bed with their messy friend they are hoping to sneak out and then claim to be on the side of justice and human dignity .
here is a long list of what their candidate has done and undone they own it .

i get about 25 cords a wood in the summer and continue chopping in the winter for heat .
all i feel is i`m getting older each year while i am doing that .
"how do you know this , when no one else does ?"
the correct answer is that you just made this up .
if she was that bad one would have thought it would be easy to unseat her .
"instead , she consistently won her ward by huge margins ."
i can see why you chose the moniker you did .
all you have to do to make easy money is to abandon your moral scruples .
but it is possible to do it in journalism too .
the bbc's evan solomon didn't worry about moral scruples himself while sanctimoniously lecturing the politicians .
html i prefer to stick with rasmussen considering how badly the ones claiming otherwise are the one that bungled elections predictions so badly they are still in meltdown .
that would be cool that he transits is don't drive that take the bus too .
and it is much cheaper hen taking the truck or car down too .
we might take the bus to silverado some time or brementon too .
9/11 was almost sixteen years ago .
"if this was about making the us safe , then we should have banned people from these specific countries right after 9/11 when it would have made sense ."
it didn't make sense and the bush administration wasn't full of bigots who hated immigrants like the trumpkins .
"in fact , bush went out of his way to make sure that americans didn't blame all muslims and i betcha that because of that there were less hate crimes against muslims right after the attacks ."
there is no clear and present threat from five-year-olds from iran and grandmas from iraq .
this is about giving people who don't even have a passport and probably didn't even know yemen was a country a scapegoat to assuage their dumb and irrational fears about terrorism .

i was trying not to be so well blunt .
"but , the words you use work very well to describe some actions by the church , behavior that worked in the past but is not consistent with how much of the world thinks and acts and lives in the present ."
there are no longer kings and princes with divine rights in the world of today - no absolute rulers who claim their power is from god .
hard to understand or accept that change in how power and authority are claimed and used also affects the princes of the church .
but they are not held in the same awe today as in the past and their claim of that kind of authority is no longer accepted to the same degree .
i think we are trying to figure out how much authority popes and bishops will have in and over our lives .
but it isn't and won't be what it was in the past .
please provide some proof of this vast media conspiracy .
"when confronted with factual evidence , reality appears to escape you ."
take a look at your initial comment .
it is genuine propaganda in every sense of the term .
and to just keep repeating it compromises your intellect .
trump has never held any elective office at all .
not even a school board seat .
people need to have a longer memory of what these political elitists have done to sell us out and use every opportunity to turf them out .
presidents retain their title for life .
we've been calling former presidents president so-and-so throughout 44 presidents so far .
"why , after 43 consecutive times of this not being an issue , are some people coming out of the woodwork and screaming and foaming at the mouth about president obama ?"
what is it about president obama that makes him so different from the prior 43 presidents and causes some people to want to disrespect him so much and erase him from history and break with tradition just to spite him ?
i suspect we're living in an age of entitlement and those who whine and moan about issues like this are the most entitled of all .
i'm deeply offended by this column .
i didn't hate muslims before and i don't hate them now .
and i know many people just like me .
i think this article says far more about the writer's personal prejudices than it does about those of canadians .
lawyer up if you think that you have a case .
"oh no , more muslims as oppressed and marginalized victims propaganda ."
"although i guess it's no longer a surprise , seeing as how canadian media is saturated with this narrative ."
"it's like the author mentions in her own article , it appears we can become accustomed to anything , provided it’s repeated often enough ."
so you're saying afghanistan is khadr's home ?
"a telescreen from nineteen eighty four , by george orwell ."
"no , stupid lefty , it isn't a dog-whistle; no matter what your perfessers told you ."
"i can't for the life of me understand why right wing groups in the states are anti-semitic , when american and canadian jews are not responsible for one single death ."
they don't drive into groups of people nor strap exposives to their body .
"they are not seen in the streets of canada and the states , brandishing ak-47s , 74s , akms and aks's , while invoking whatever deity ."
how can jews possibly be removed from judeo-christian society .
"what would we have left - nascar , dixie beer ?"
this is not raising any tax but is closing a loophole which should have been closed a long time ago had any previous government had the courage to do so of course if such a loophole is closed those who were using it will not be happy .
but to pretend that this is an increase in taxes is false .
the two pages maddow reported on don't have the information that is actually of importance .
"the further information trump has released doesn't , either ."
this is nothing but a distraction .
this very paper proudly published an artice called deconstructing whiteness by some race baiting huckster or another .
and these are the people who go around calling everyone else racist doubtful .
obama's approval rating is over 50% .
who was at 25% his last year in office .
"michael , what are you basing this comment on ?"
what catholic theology speaks of ordained priesthood as a right ?
"continence is not misogynistic , it is a norm of living recognized by all faithful catholics from the earliest days of the church and is also the model of jesus christ himself ."
"those who reject this have a warped idea of sexuality , the conjugal act and continence for the sake of the kingdom of god ."
newsflash: wealthy contributors influence political leaders how shocking !
maybe canadians can prevent such corruption by electing a party that isn't beholden to corporate donors .
every party is run by corporate donors .
and when did we know it ?
"pnw mike , you might not know that in 1875 the us supreme court stated , the right to bear arms is not granted by the constitution; neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence ."
"the second amendment means no more than that it shall not be infringed by congress , and has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the national government ."
cruikshank ) webster defines militia as a part of the organized armed forces of a country liable to call only in emergency .
the second amendment grants the right to own guns to members of a well regulated militia .
only those who are part of an organized armed forces have the right to own guns .
notley knows she is doomed next election bar a massive turnaround in the polls and the oil price .
so she is swinging for the fences as this is the only strategy that will secure re-election .
if she is right she stands a chance of winning .
"if she does nothing , the status quo , she will lose , and , if she is wrong on this call , she will also lose ."
better to out it all on red and hope for the best .
seems very reasonable and while you are at it converting the defined benefit plans of universities into defined contribution plans would be helpful too .
the one i've been forced to pay into has a large unfunded liability and my concern is that the money will not all be there when i need my pension .
i would much rather have a defined contribution plan where i have some control over how it is invested and know that the money is there ( barring a financial catastrophe of such a scale that even defined benefit plans will be toast ) .
the us has an excellent system like this with many universities using tiaa-cref .
welcome to the globalization of canada .

"oh ya , his followers are already frothing at the mouth over fake news , they just don't have the smarts to distinguish between what is or isn't actual truth ."
"in the absence of that ability , they regularly attack the media ( except faux news , the biggest liar of all ) as their dear leader has instructed them to do  i wonder what his frequent flyer miles are he is from georgia or perhaps he has his own plane that he can deduct as a business expense ."
"we've been meddling in the mid east for many years , though not as many as the arabs and the jews have been at it ."
"however , the latest forays were all begun by georgie , though in his defense , he was ordered to do them ."
i would be interested in knowing how trump is putting a stop to any of it .
the only president who will be able to claim this will be the one who completely withdraws american troops and advisers from the region .
those who increase troops are only aiding and abetting .
wasn't it trump's latest plan to increase the number of troops in afghanistan ?
roads are an investment in infrastructure .
but pali highway is a state highway - not anything to do with rail .
just as good an investment is investing in kids in poverty who never receive adequate early education .
they do very poorly in school and in life if they miss the important developmental tasks in their early years .
for them it's a basic need .
and for us it's an investment in their futures that they cannot afford .
studies show that even at ages 27 and 40 they lose out and are on the bottom of the heap .

today's activists are more likely to throw rocks and bottles and to smash windows and set fires .
"it is doubtful that the police officer involved is representative of his department's officers , at least i hope not !"
the article states there is a rule prohibiting staff from receiving gifts from parishioners .
the author should have checked the facts .
there was no such rule posted in the staff handbook on the venice diocesan website .
and i would guess that most priests receive gifts from parishioners such as going away or other events .
heck our parish took up a collection and gave money to the new priest to set up the rectory with whatever he needed .
"for the record , i have never said that you are totally whacked , nor have i said anything of the like ."

"midas1 , the claim that diversity is meritorious is not just opinion ."
it exists in the domain of fact and there are studies to back it up .
"according to mckinsey , companies in the top quartile for racial and ethnic diversity are 35 percent more likely to have financial returns above their respective national industry medians ."
com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters many other studies have found that diverse groups outperform homogenous groups .
the groups with racial diversity significantly outperformed the groups with no racial diversity .
being with similar others leads us to think we all hold the same information and share the same perspective .
"this perspective , which stopped the all-white groups from effectively processing the information , is what hinders creativity and innovation ."
com/article/how-diversity-makes-us-smarter/ r&r you have it all wrong .
it's an attempt to tend to the souls of those who are just plain embarrassing themselves and don't know it .
"but they have participated in something that will cause great harm , possibly to millions ."
they need to recognize and own the role they played in creating what could harm millions .
it is no small thing - it is huge .
i am still of the mind that i will not make use of catholic hospitals or nursing homes .
"i fear in the competitive world in which we live , that they will drive out of business some other care givers who have a greater respect for those they treat and those they employ ."

i appreciate your wanting to be sensitive and the fact that you recognize the good they do .
"but they also harm others , disrespect others ."
i won't pretend they are all goodness and light .

v=wechg1khmty it is not just “right wing” catholics that are wondering what he is doing .
"venezuela has complex and deep-seated problems , based , to a great extent in extreme social inequality ."
i am glad that the church is beginning to pay attention to the needs of the people .
"i only hope that , going forward , the church will not be aligned with the wealthy ."
it is time to put things in order to bring order .
warner shouldn't worry about trumpies dining at his italian restaurant .
most trumpies pick up italian cuisine at walmart frozen counters .
i agree i was showing the absurdity of the previous post .
"when you say pay according to one's ability ( and receive according to one's need ) , that's a tenant of communism ."
many on the right believe their wealth validates their hard work .
for the poor their low income shows a failure of character .
"black lives matter is hypnotically dramatizing george owell's story , 1984 ."
i read the book in high school in the '60's and never imagined there would be any citizens so stupid a to suppress free speech in america .
both antifa and blm have done so by trying to harm people who want to speak .
the issue is one of safety related to the airport .
"this field is within the airport overlay , and must be clear of trees for the safety of pilots and the public ."
"no one is profiting from the removal of trees ( except maybe the crew doing the work ) , and there will be no buildings on the property ."
"if anyone took the time to do a few minutes of research online ( which does take more effort than complaining ) , they would find detailed information on the project on the port of orcas website ."
this includes the requirement for wetland creation and enhancement .
"the list of native plants planned for the project is extensive , and should create a much more diverse wetland than has been there for decades ."
concern for runoff from enchanted forest road is misguided .
"it cannot run uphill south along lovers lane and into east sound , but must instead run into the swale and the engineered wetland before it enters the bay ."
"runoff in the village remains a serious issue , however ."
let me count the ways: ( 1 ) i'm 63--birthday 05/10/54 ( 2 ) i have a decent vocabulary because i'm pre-computer literate .
( 3 ) i only have a dumb phone .
( 4 ) logical and your mind are contradictions in terms .
btw--what name did i call you ?
hey your right ( for some reason it survived a refresh on my browser ) !
must of been that s e x word .
i don't think ever the puritans were that staid .
there really are some sad people here .
"for centuries , christians went on rampages of destruction to eliminate statues and graven imagery from churches ."
much of the classical world was demolished to cleanse the world of pagan idolatry not unlike how these zealots now destroy art they don't tolerate .
"today , muslim armies of isis also blow up and destroy artworks across the me to eradicated history they want to obliterate ."
"the sjws of america , championed by the news media and democrats cheer as they descend into barbarism ."
once again proves it is the most corrupt and one sided organization on the planet and should be scrapped !
it is totally dominated by an islamic and socialist agenda !
"ah , so heterosexual couples who cannot conceive take a sort of pleasure in a mimicking sort of way ."
you have bought into the idea taught by the stoics that sex must be justified by saying it must be for procreation .
you then give us some speculation about essentially fertile that some theologians who push the idea about justifying sex through procreation .
sex can be good for its own sake .
"it is unifying , for both gay and straight couples who love each other ."
the court is packed with obama judges that supports children killing children .
i will vote for trump to save the law .
oh meathead the market only fell to under 7000 due to the momemtum of the g w bush economic crash .
you need to pay attention more .
this was the worse recession since the great depression .
"perhaps if gw didn't give tax cuts during a time of war , he wouldn't have left the next president with a trillion plus budget defficit ."
there is no reason at all to increase refugee quotas or scrap asylum .
trudeau has already made his headlines and gotten his grandstanding over with presenting canada as the opposite of the u .
perpetuating the canadian brand is all that matters .
no one will ever know his offer was more fraudulent than his 'canada is back' humanitarian gesture of bringing in 20 or 30 thousand syrians .
or on freighters carrying north korean cosl ?

korean freighters carrying hyundais or samsungs or hps to the us ?
"the only way i can foresee there not being us military action within the next couple of weeks is for either there to be a government overthrow in north korea; or much stronger punitive actions by china; or a capitulation by north korea that , in some way , allows them to save a little face - maybe a bit at our expense ."

someone complains that they can no longer say merry christmas because they fear someone else will be offended .
how often does that really happen ?
"i'm atheist and i'm never offended by good wishes , however phrased ."
"if you want to say merry christmas , then say it ."
"it is possible you will meet a few idjits who get offended , but if they were raised with manners , they will return with kind words ."
"if they return with insults , then you are the better person ."
dalon joshua white should be in jail for the rest of his life for doing this what a sad person alabama the quest to overtake mississippi continues .
"to find the answers , dr ."
"well , some of the answers ."
"typical oversight , unfortunately ( see the g&m's unfounded series , for example ."
") and there's this: the writer says , the conclusions are complex , though suggest some clear patterns ."
"well , if they only suggest then perhaps the patterns aren't all that clear , after all ."
"which negates the following phrase: in fact which negates what comes next: and that , in turn , predicts it's not necessarily a fact and so cannot predict anything with any certainty ."
in short: nothing much is known for sure .
"as i recall , the marital break-up had nothing to do with her success--or his lack of it ."
the simple fact was that ( 1 ) he was foolin' around and ( 2 ) she caught him out .
jesus kept telling her to shut up .
"and i recall one particular time when she and the family , due to some concern and probable embarrassment about his doings were asking about him ."
"he used it as a great teaching moment about his own family bond with us and , we assume , conflabed with the fam afterward setting their minds at rest about his mission ."
i agree with you about the need for young voices .
as a former religious ed teacher i was continually inspired by the soulful contributions of my students .
kishimoto's name may sound japanese but she looks more caucasian than asian .
"regardless , she is carrying a lot of unflattering reviews from her previous positions ."
"well , with the new approach of minimizing tests and ranking of schools to not hurt the sensitivity of dumb students , she should fit right into our public school system ."
"without facebook and twitter , islamic state wouldn't exist ."
"what makes aklng the most risky is that this project requires the sovereign not to just support the endeavor ( with loans , limited funding , grants of access , tax incentives , etc ) but to actually become an equity partner in the enterprise itself with an open ended liability ."
i don't think any of these other projects in the pipeline graveyard had this dangerous parameter as does aklng .
"of course many of these projects ( certainly agia , denali , and aklng ) are another variant of the ruse used by the governments and their supporters when they find themselves on the losing side in war ."
they then attempt to bolster the morale of the people ( and to delude themselves ) by promising a new wonder weapon that will turn the tide .
"sorry , but the tide is very hard to hold back and impossible to reverse ."
the rams/49ers game on thursday had 56k paying customers .

"nfl players could join isis , en masse , and denverites would still fawn over them ."
fortune magazine article on 9/20/17 nfl ratings have fallen significantly across all providers over the past seasons and so far 2017 is not looking any better .
the nfl can whistle in the graveyard but both you and i know the players are killing the model .
mlb and nhl are both looking at adding franchises .
because the nfl is dying a very public death due to flagging attendance and lost viewership .
alienating potential customers by insulting them ?
doesn't take a harvard mba to figure out the income trajectory .
"see player protests in mlb , nhl , mls , or nba ?"
there is no regressive social message .
this isn't nothing new about trump and one shouldn't be surprise .
trump was bashing senator mccain that was a pow in asia for over five years .
he tried to treat a muslim family like dirt that had lost a son serving in the us army .
"so , this is consistent with trump's behavior , the way he is accused of offending the family of the fallen soldier ."
"you don't get it , trump doesn't have much under his hat ."
"we have been providing bombs , weapons , intel and even refueling american made saudi jets on their way to drop american made weapons of destruction on yemen ."
and now we act outraged that someone shot a missile at us ?
"we are creating over there today , the enemy we will be fighting at over here tomorrow ."
the age of the oil wars are over - we are now a net oil exporter .
we don't need arab dictators anymore than we need african dictators or asian dictators as our friends .
we never really needed them in the first place - it was the big oil company folks who did .
military alliances should be reviewed every five years to determine if they still are worthy of our defense dollars and soldiers lives .
blindly backing dictators has backfired in our face every single time .
there's just some uncertainty between mr .
trump's rhetoric and some of his choices as it relates to personnel and other things .
"this is keeping doors open , perhaps the best thing to do ."
but we all need to be careful about how far we can go in accepting uncertain rhetoric and questionable personnel .
"when/where is a step too far , one lie to many ?"
really - massacres in bowling green and islamic terrorist bombings in atlanta ?
there is not a single thing said by conway or spicer that should not be first doubted until confirmed by a source with actual facts .
"i mean the real kind , not the alternative kind ."
here are a few stats for you: https://www .

islam must also go through an enlightenment .
"i knew a year ago hillary clinton couldn't beat anyone the republicans put up against her , including president-elect-pumpkin-spice- —– grabber you could have stayed classy , but veered off into vulgarity ."
"you attempt to add to jesus' words , too !"
jesus' words i like very much .
your accretions are a different story entirely !
"whatever the verdict , canadian taxpayers better not be on the hook for any more bailouts ."
"there were some parishes that gave sanctuary in the 80s to fleeing salvadorans {mine did] ncr should send the above picture { methodist church] to every us bishop and ask how many of his own parishes had a sanctuary meeting by 11-15-16 , if none then kiss the pic and say good by to the millions of catholic latino immigrants both documented undocumented and native born ."
the pews are smaller and fewer .
"thus , the church appears to be better attended ."
"québécoise transgender actress gabrielle tremblay for her first film role received her first nomination and the first transgender to be nominated as best actress in a supporting role to the canadian screen award for her performance in the film « ceux qui font les révolutions qu’à moitié n’ont fait que creuser leur tombeau» ( those who make revolution halfway only dig their own graves/ best canadian film at tiff , 2016 ( huge success !"

"so glad they will be in redmond now , i won't need to shop anywhere else !"
"i do not like london , nor the britons ."
"for me , these people are funny , but often at the expense of the minorities , the poor , and the downtrodden ."
those bombings happen regularly not for no reason .
a zionist lie retold a thousand times is still a zionist lie .
"the broncos spent very little money to see if charles , a game changing speed back , still had some magic left in his legs ."
"he'll be a speed back that will complement cj , our main 'thumper' ."
lynch is a thumper and he would be competing with cj .
"and not only has lynch taken a major pounding in his career , mentally he's played that i'm retiring no , im unretiring game ."
charles has been hurt but has never wavered about his desire to play .
i had wanted to elaborate on that last sentence a bit more but ran out of space to finish it ( another annoying product of civil ) .
"by black mark i meant by hanging around too long , or worse , being a detriment to the senate being able to pass anything ( which is already a difficult enough task with the current senate make-up ) ."
"if he did hang onto the seat but left it vacant for months ( especially now , and at this age ) , i think that would unnecessarily leave a black mark on the end of what's a great career of service to the country ."
i would hate for people to think of that as his final chapter as a senator .
your comments do not paint a complete picture .
"as i detail with references elsewhere on this board , there are now 1 ."
"6 million canadians who say they're ethnically chinese but , astoundingly , somewhere between 0 ."
"5 million of those chinese-canadians are living in hong kong and mainland china , not in canada ."
that is a huge number living on the other side of the ocean .
the city of hong kong has been home to more than a quarter million canadians for more than a decade .
"contrary to your post's claim , there is a very substantial portion of chinese canadians whose workplaces are located across the ocean ."
"and that portion is far , far higher than it was for say hungarians or portuguese or japanese who came to canada half a century or a century ago ."
"when they came , they came and stayed , they and their kids - university educated here - did not dash back to the homeland en masse for high-paying executive jobs  this should read: growing conflicts between humans and every other natural thing lead to deaths of pretty much everything not human ."
they are the virus that infests .
no one seems to get that .
"the banks and cc companies add on at least 2 1/2% as a fee , except the amazon canadian card ( chase bank ) ."
that's what i really meant to say .
let's neither do that or give ourselves any reason to get attacked by a grizzly bear the practices used to obtain meat are as horrifying as those used to obtain most fur .
suggest you read eating animals by jonathan safran foer .
"there is also a need to create more opportunities for all of us to be able to earn enough to be the primary providers of our own health care , housing and food needs not only whole working but in retirement as well ."
"we also have a personal responsibility to know how to lead healthy lives what to eat , how to exercise and sleep so we will lessen our need for health care and be in a better position to fight the effects of diseases including cancer ."
as a free people we should be willing and able to take on more responsibility for our own welfare and be dependent on government mainly for defense against foreign enemies and terrorists with weapons of mass destruction and for recovery from and survial during and after large scale natural disasters .
the less demands we make on government the fewer taxes governments will have to collect .
"the federal government alone has $20 trillion deficit , the best way to lower it is to make fewer demands on government ."
"hillary could have ended the turmoil of feckless recount efforts , bogus hysteria over the supposed hacking of podesta and dnc emails by the russians ( as though the source of any truth contained in the emails is more important than the truth itself ) , and now the effort to create faithless electors who do not vote as they promised they would when they were included on the ballot , by two simple words stop it ."
"hillary lost the election and conceded as much on election night; unfortunately , her lust for power makes her incapable of reigning in her cult followers , who are persisting in all this first and foremost because of hillary's all but explicit encouragement ."
i'm not convinced that more than 2% of the homeless in eugene are illegal aliens they appear to born & breed by caucasians in the usa .
"a wall around texas would be nice but seriously , the republicans appear to be incapable of learning from their to the mistakes ."
mittens blew it with his dinner party comments and the donald ?
", well he pretty much offends anyone with an education past eighth grade which might explain his appeal to the racist , sexist crowd ."
"what he really is though is a shape shifter , adopting conflicting perspectives depending on who he's talking to ."
"so , all that other stuff like the guns on campus and purchase of the wf building are now dead ?"
"no , they will figure out how to buy that building ."
several commentaries here have expressed the view that it is the business of state government to provide free government for them .
many of these same people want to cut off the free government of others in order to keep getting their free government .
"when understanding of these competing notions overtakes my limited cognitive ability , i will have achieved a plane ."
"as this story shows , it is interesting what number combinations that can pop up when the dice are rolled ."
"these days a $17/mo modem connection gets you instant access in your own home , or anywhere on a cellphone , to the world's largest library ."
i haven't gone to a physical library in years .
they're for technophobe luddites and people that have an obsession to hold paper in their hands .
they do make places for homeless people to sleep but isn't it cheaper to build shelters ?
"yes , we have an obligation to provide access to information so citizens can make informed decisions , but few politicians respect the will of the majority anyway , so what's the need for physical libraries any more ?"
"why not just provide public internet access in kiosks like coffee shacks , distributed within walking distance of everyone ."
even if they had to drive there it would take less time than going to a central library .
;- ) tell me why you need a big special building for a library ?
"this showed up as a response to me- i'm still trying to figure out how he went from praising the tweet , to calling it boneheaded , to whining at all the people who considered it boneheaded in the first place ."
hey all you people who thought this was a dumb tweet five minutes before i called it a dumb tweet - you're all way too thin-skinned and sensitive !
it is a dumb tweet-he referenced japan/us history long ago which made sense as to why that reference but he never should have tweeted it .
"most catholics have no alternative to the novus ordo , many , most have never experienced the mass of all ages ."
pope francis has recently expressed his difficulty in understanding why young people who never experienced the tridentine rite until recently are so attracted to it .
"he dismissed them of course as rigid traditionalists wedded to the past , much in the same way he dismisses anyone who disagrees with him ."
it's a continuation of a tax increase and a sneaky way around property tax limitations !
when is it going to end ?
"this bond measure isn't about streets , it's about freeing up money for pers ."
i guess there's only so much mourning to go around .
"we have a close , historic tie to britain ."
at least the british government is trying its very best to root out and prosecute islamists who choose violence to support their aims .
governments in yemen or nigeria - - not so much !
the electoral college has no affect on state and local elections .
hamilton helped create the electoral college to make sure a unqualified charlatan didn't make it to the office of the presidency .
my question to all of the electors is this please clarify who you do consider unqualified for the office of the presidency ?
"hitler , pol pot , ghadaffi , bin laden , david duke , or do the all get a pass as well ?"
there are resources fro hundreds of billions iof us in this solar system .
layla4 i am trying to understand why people are surprised when muslims kill brits .
"british soldiers invaded iraq and killed countless muslims in fact i was surprised that there were not more attacks , the attack on iraq was so blatant ."
i thought that more than muslims would be upset at the world's most powerful country attacking a weak defenseless country .
we knew from vietnam that the us uses lies to start a war .
"and then even more appalling , the brits , knowing that , join in the slaughter ."
"finally , the attack on iraq was due to a lie - weapons of mass destruction ."
how can one think us and uk without disbelief .
she said her ancestors were jewish so that means she isn't anti-semite .
which would be like me saying some of my best friends are colored so i can't be racist .
"knowing and occasionally eyeing nsheema khan commentaries , i can safely say , she doesn't miss an opportunity to further her agenda of her 'inclusive' culture in canada as a dominant force in our society ."
how about the inclusion of a catholic nun in the globe commentaries section ?
"all we have to do is eliminate corporate welfare and the the country will have billions in the coffers  to those interested in this thread i think that the custom of baptizing infants grew out of a mis-application of jesus' saying that unless you are baptized , you cannot enter the kingdom of heaven ."
and then we mis-applied the idea of an 'original sin and all the rest .
eventually leading to a need to create a doctrine of 'limbo' to solve the self-created problem of innocent children not going to either heaven nor hell .
i feel much safer knowing that pm gomer is looking out for us .
"the nicest people are usually very tough on those who would exploit the most vulnerable this makes the pope's exceedingly stern rebuke of the nigerian priests in question , including references both to mortal sin in not following the pope and to the danger of scandal arising from this all the more intriguing ."
i have no problem with a pope who alludes to mortal sin or who calls catholics to obedience or who wishes to avoid scandal .
"but , it is hard to ignore that this unprecedented ( for francis ) rebuke is directed at priests on an impoverished continent over what even in the internet age counts as a quarrel in a far away country between people of whom we know nothing ."
would francis have reacted similarly in say a german diocese ?
might c kasper's very low opinion of the african church have been important ?
"is this the only , or the most serious , scandal facing catholicism ?"
how come mortal sin figures here but never in 200+ pages of amoris l ?
this reminds me of the bishops from south america lamenting to pope francis about people going to priest of parallel catholic churches .
both seem to think the laity is ignorant .
the bishops fail to realize that people will respond if the bishops are not honest and accountable .
the people in south america spoke with their feet and it will be interesting to see how the people in mn respond .
there are plenty of parallel validly ordained priest ready to serve the people of mn .
please tell me you are joking lizzy or maybe have had a few too many irish car bombs ?
you might want to go back and read your original article .
the only outside source you reference is eater nothing about people on twitter .
"i feel like someone who makes five figures an hour doesn't fly commercial , let alone coach ."
the article should not be too disappointed at how the vote on moral and social issues went down .
the political noise coming from the flight deck of the usccb is the sound of one hand clapping .
all of the groups cited are examples of directives from the top of the pyramid that never really make it to the pews .
"in a church that fails to regularly evangelize and teach from that top , and instead chooses to extemporize and condemn with the tip of their index finger , it is no wonder that the faithful have become tone deaf ."
"in california i was disappointed that the death penalty was not disallowed , but i heard not one word from the altar to support this important measure ."
"in the catholic structure and in the rare air of the episcopacy , there is too much talking among themselves , self congratulatory back slapping , and look good in rome nonsense that doesn't go anywhere ."
"it is time to come down from the mountain , roll up your sleeves , and stand in the mud with the rest of us ."
outsider: the distinction was really quite clear .
'the bakery regularly made wedding cakes for heterosexual couples' wedding .
they specifically refused to make a cake for a lesbian couple .
same service baking a wedding cake service provided for the heterosexual couples service denied to the lesbian couple .
discrimination against a protected class and a very clear case it was .
you might research the question of discrimination based on political affiliation a bit .
i provided a very helpful link for you .
take the time to educate yourself a bit .
"gary crum because of trump influence , the price of the epipen has dropped at cvs from the death defying $600 to a mere $100 for a generic product , and even to $10 with discount coupons ."
"he will be despised and loathed for reduced prices on hiv drugs , especially by the lgbt community , ordinary americans may find that with lower drug costs , which trump is encouraging , comes affordable health care ."
part 3 anselm's ingenuity made his work popular .
he emphasizes that it was for us and for our salvation that christ came to earth and was crucified .
"however , his theory has problems ."
"he has jesus' death alone , apart from his life , constituting satisfaction ."
nor does he consider the resurrection .
"also , god seems merciless and relentless in pursuit of justice and honor -- or if not merciless , helpless by being fenced in by the divine law ."
"when caught , she was so upset but only because she had gotten caught ."
she couldn't comprehend being upset about what she'd actually done .
"a textbook compulsive liar , a lot like our president ."
is it not pandering to obama ?
"so if i understand you correctly , if i promise to smear the mexican border idea , i get to drive a bmw ?"
there is a reason why the bishops don't talk tough to catholic politicians who support legalizing abortion .
it's because abortion was not legalized by congress .
it was legalized by the u .
supreme court striking down state laws criminalizing abortion .
"the only way to again criminalize abortion is to change the composition of the supreme court , a slow , indirect process since justices are appointed for life ."
"this is the reason why , although i am socioeconomically liberal , i vote for republican presidents who are more likely to appoint pro-life justices ."
- whenever i can justify such a vote .
( li voted democratic in the last election .
")  sorry , but you don't get to decide who's protestant and who's catholic ."
"i stated that gumbleton's approach is consistent with mainstream catholic scripture scholarship , and it most certainly is ."
do a little independent research and you'll see that i'm correct .
or continue to take a backwards fundamentalist view if you prefer .
your politics exceeds your understanding and history of a natural climatology processes .
"pot , meet kettle  kk , i am not a big fan of targeted tax credits ."
"while i am all for a viable economy , i do not see tax credits as anything but a way for politicians to create high targeted tax rates and then provide tax relief to those who keep the incumbent reelection war chests funded ."
crony capitalism created by politicians for politicians !
the sexual mores of our current society are more subjective and nebulous than any other time in our history .
"although i may consider what this senator did as being highly contemptible , it would be disingenuous to say the least if he was expelled by his peers for this apparent indiscretion ."
i am reminded of the gospel of john ch .
it's not a law - it's a motion .
"think of it as a form of 'virtue signalling' - the conspicuous expression of moral values by an individual done primarily with the intent of enhancing that person's standing within a social group - for politicians , and you won't be far wrong ."
you are not really suggesting that you actually believe the legislature exists to serve the needs of you and other constituents are you ?
at least now we have a real witch !
"if trump ends nafta , he hurts many of the farmers who voted for him ."
maybe we will see more manufacturing in america .
"so far , despite all his nastiness , trump has failed to do much ."
a lot of his dumb ideas will get reversed by the next president .
you honestly believe distracted driving laws are there to protect us from ourselves ?
admit it economics is more about agreements than merit .
"you agree to wear a suit , cut your hair , and provide excellent customer service ."
"in terms of evolution via group selectivity this way of life , this moral standard of professionalism is nothing more than the instinctive urge to identify in packs , to single out another , and to make them subserviant ."
"homelessness is made hard by society breaking them up and keeping them on the run like rats , but there is nothing about you and your way of life which makes you more deserving than someone walking 25 miles/ per day recycling cans and living off the land ."
"in fact your way of life is far more destructive than a hobos and in fact it could be called theivery slaying entire forests for constructing your home , polluting the entire planet for the sake of your car , stealing nutrients from hard working animals , then turning around and claiming you did it all yourself !"
trudeau has his pat answers for each situation .
instead of confronting terrorism he talks of division .
we need a leader who calls these terrorists what they are and confront the culture they come from .
they are not terrorists because of anything else but islam .
that's all you can do in hawaii .
"weird , i replied but i guess my reply was deleted ?"
"i originally quoted it in french but here it is in english , from each according to his ability , to each according to his needs ."
"you see casey the bums are not giving according to their ability , so there is no need to recognize their needs ."
the bums have chosen to be junkies .
they have decided they would rather inject poison into their veins than be active citizens .
the rest of us can then decide that they are not giving according to their ability .
if they refuse to contribute then we should be free to drive them away .
"the junkies and bums are not , and have no intention of being , a part of civilization ."
"that's why they compare july to july , not april to july: the number of homes sold fell 40 ."
4 per cent in july compared to the same month last year .
"any argument about it's summer , vacations , long weekends , etc , would apply equally to the july of both years ."
jesus was of the house of david .
"probably had a jewish nose , looked very jewish ."
"the supremacists probably won't be revived until the second resurrection , for judgment ."
but you're point is well made tmq .
there will be lots of surprised souls at both resurrections .
did you read this morning's dunesbury ?
"i'd feel a bit sorry for him , but who i am to step in front of the karma express ?"
"what about equal treatment for the majority , i'm guessing you believe in the constitution as long as it suits you , how about the second amendment you believe in that , there is plenty of room in the world for everyone , if i own a business and refuse to serve a white redneck , would there be a lawsuit and lose my business , if i was gay i would not want a cake baked by somebody who didn't want my business , its pretty pathetic that some people need the government to force a another's lifestyle upon them and gain legitimacy by government intervention , this is not the way to gain legitimacy , that is gained by actions not political activators ."
"this city has gone to hell , i applaud the owner of grubstake auctions , this city does nothing !"
i have a buisness effected by theses degenerites !
"i feel bad for the real homeless or people hard on there luck , but the ones walking the street are thugs that are taking over others rights !"
look at the tesoro at northern lights and seward hwy .
"they sit on private property daily , they should be arrested for trespassing and liotering , but the city does nothing !"

2 ) you blame democrats for doing something when the option was nothing .
republicans and conservative democrats are against single payer - which is what obama wanted to do in teh first place .
the aca was a compromise to those hard lined democrats who would not vote for single payer .
"republicans complained about obamacare for 7 years and then when it was their turn , they put something together that amazingly takes us a step back , instead of trying to move us forward ."
"before the aca , millions of people did not have insurance that now do ."

the 100% jew run cadmus group they are city state government contractor for the epa and homeland security .

the jew met his just domain .
killed by a white who defended himself against 3 assailants .
who also killed a vet homeland security contractor .
your buds think the two deserved to die at the hands of this trump supporter .
lets chat about the klinton lies shall we .
my intent was to demonstrate the dishonesty of the us media .
such a big deal over the kofm which previously was treated as an unimportant charity until the boogeyman burke was dishonestly portrayed as a decisive protagonist .
this was not confirmed by the three kofm officials who gave their own narratives .
"compare this entire kofm episode of little importance to the complete media blackout - except for a few catholic websites - of the pope's continuing efforts to reconcile with the anti-semitic sspx , by the way , burke is now using the notoriety the us media gifted him with in order to get involved again in politics ."
"he met with matteo salvini , the leader of italy's populist right-wing northern league , last week ."

so if there's so little fishing occurring why did we need to ban fishing ?
"oh yea , to combat climate change and protect sunken wwii relics ."
stock assessments of pelagic species are conducted by analyzing catch per unit effort .

this means that it's going to be just about impossible to actually demonstrate that the expanded monument has been successfull .

did the anti-war movement wear out nixon ?
"i'm suspicious of the idea that the north vietnamese could have been bombed into submission given that about 1 , 000 , 000 people died under american bombs without inspiring any submission ."
this also happened in north korea; massive body count from massive bombing but no submission .
"the reason our military adventurism hasn't ended is that the elites learned the lesson of vietnam: no massive deployment+no draft+low body count ( ours ) = no anti-war movement , no matter how many people american arms kill ."
your history of the black resistance leaves out malcolm x and the nation of islam .
it also neglects how civil rights were not automatically granted after 1964--and they still aren't .

what church did you say you attend ?
"yes , kon , we all know it's always up to the dems to fix everything because the republicans are too stupid and too lazy to do anything but whine ."
"in this case , kon , the gop has already said it doesn't want no steenking proposed changes are anything else from the dems ."
it just wants to ram the legislation through as quickly as possible .
"like a rapist assaulting someone in the shadows right outside of a police station , and about as savory ."
so why don't you pose your questions to your republican masters .

they were the ones calling a clear gerrymandering in colorado by democrats a 'gop' favored plan .
but when you depend on the 'brennan center' as your 'objective source' you are going to have horribly skewed results .
"of course when they contradict themselves in the same article to show colorado was heavily gerrymandered in favor of thedemocrats it's hard to use anything out of the articl self-proclaimed christians , as opposed to real ones , tend to be more judgmental and consider themselves better than others ."

i notice the adn doesn't bother mentioning who these people are: are the ones making the conscious decision to wreck their lives businessmen ?
there is comparable data on national trends of use-- but why would they not give any for alaskan's use ?

"from the state's epidemiology report , overdose deaths in alaska were 17 per 100 , 000 people ."

those who see francis' choices for cardinal in liberal/conservative terms completely miss the point .
he isn't interested in mundane politics but in getting back to the roots of the gospel -- the poor church for the poor .
"in order to do that , he's slowly correcting the historic imbalances in the college of cardinals that had europe and north america over-represented and the poorer nations of the world grossly underrepresented ."
"if you want a glimpse into the pope's mind , pay attention to what he told cardinal-elect mangkhanekhoun: the strength of the church resides in the local church , especially the church that is small , the church that is weak , and the church that is persecuted ."
this is the backbone of the universal church .
"how does this match up with the traditional wisdom that those who cab , do; those who can't , teach ?"

i do not see the word christian in either of the quotes mentioned in this article .
adam vaughan speaks of scheer as someone opposed to civil rights advancements while pablo rodriguez speaks of scheer as a social conservative .
neither of these comments is in any way anti-christian .
many christians support civil rights and have been prominent in the struggle for the recognition and protection of those rights .
"not all christians , by any stretch of the imagination , are social conservatives; and certainly not all social conservatives are christians ."
"simply because some right-wing , socially conservative christians may think they are truer christians than those who support more left-wing , environmental , or human rights causes does not make it so ."
how come every group of people in the world other than whites is entitled to a homeland that's not over-run with foreigners ?
the liberals have not been forced to conduct these champagne and canapé events because the cancelled subsidy has deprived them of funds .
raising monies at the grass roots ( electorate ) level is a far different proposition than privileged access such as appears to be occurring in this instance .

but what we are discussing is if the protest spirit of the 60s is almost dead .
the marches all over the country and world are larger than any march or protest i can think of in recent history .

"turns out she stole from an equally worthy institution , a nyssa school district , evidently without remorse or restitution , although she was treated then with the consideration we'd have likely offered her here as a female white collar criminal besides the lack of budget oversight which allowed her to get away with such a massive theft at sl , i'm disappointed in the professional staff at serenity lane who failed to note these defects in her character ."

congratulations to the denver post editorial board - great example of an opinion in search of facts to support it .
the board's decision to simply ignore or gloss over inconvenient facts is the hallmark of those like plaintiffs in the original suit .
the victims that the board sees are the two who sought to have a cake .
"if the couple had come into the store to purchase a off-the-shelf cake , nothing would have been said about their plan to use it for a wedding that they were a same-sex couple - and the bakery would have sold it to them ."
"rather , it was a custom-made product that the couple wanted and , in doing so , the artist/baker would indeed have to use his artistic abilities to express something he did not believe in ."
this case differs from the heart-of-atlanta motel case .
"finally , why would this couple want this baker to make their cake ?"
are there no other bakeries or any gay/lesbian/transgender bakers in denver would have gladly made the cake ( and probably done a better job ) ?
send me your keys ( keys were given that day ) and the birth of the key campaign began .
senator ellis had a jar of keys that represented people who experience disabilities; sitting on his desk .
for him it was the challenge to represent the people who experience disabilities; for them; it meant they had someone to represent them .
i had the pleasure of meeting and working as an advocate for the key campaign along with senator ellis .
"i was proud to be in juneau when sb174 passed ( a bill that supports autism therapies being paid for by private insurance; that took years to pass ) he was endlessly working , advocating; he was passionate about what and or who he was representing ."
he showed people dignity and respect .
he gave people hope; as he tirelessly championed their causes .
i could go on and on; but in the end; i am one of the lucky ones to have met him and advocated with him .
thank you senator ellis; for everything you have done .
i checked the report and there isn't any valid data to support a worsening of income inequality .
"actually there isn't much valid data to support anything , it is mostly just an editorial loosely backed by some diverse and disconnected data points ."

hopefully albertans have learned their lesson and will toss the ndp out permanently .

"whom ever is posting state income tax is deductable from federal income tax , i would like to ask where are you getting this information ?"
"i just looked at a form 1040 , nowhere does it have a deduction for any income tax at any level ."
it has state income tax return to be included in your total income so you are taxed on your state tax return money .
"so mr mcnairn , i should oppose measures for tax fairness so you can make money helping others avoid their fair share ?"
should i also oppose legalization of pot because it will cut into the profit margins of the mob ?
i bet the homeless veterans who served our country who now eat of dumpsters would like this articl saying tommy douglas 'changed his mind later in life' is misleading - this was a university thesis that didn't appear to affect anything he did after that date .

the irony is that calling someone a troll in the sense of denigrating them though name calling is being a troll .
i think it is perfectly reasonable to post arguments that cause people to get upset as long at they are on topic and avoid personal attacks .

king street is a one-way four-lane thoroughfare through the city: far more people use it to commute than the bus system .
the street narrows to two lanes through part of the downtown ( and not the jackson square/convention center/office towers part ) .

"by the time the lrt is finally operational , it will be a dinosaur , as newer systems will be taking over elsewhere ."

someday nye's statement will be accurate .
as of today his statement was an outright lie .

i certainly hope you believed that being elected was a signal mark of ability and integrity when clinton and obama were elected .
"i certainly didn't believe that of bill clinton , but i have no reason not to believe that of president obama ."
trump is none of the above .
if that is true then the senate will be exactly as it was before any changes were experimented with .
have any notion of how many additional inmates we'd see in prison and the cost ?
not that there is no cost for people who drive drunk .
just want to know if you ran the numbers .
i had a friend in the 90s who did dj work and drank too much .
"he got a duii , and on condition of only using his car for more dj work , attended diversion ."
"he completed his program , kept his job , and never drank and drove again ( that i know ) ."
"he was a responsible business owner , got married and help his new wife raise her kids ."
should he have gone to jail ?
"when nobel purchased the school in 2013 , ammidown became the principal of merryhill and reported to krista bielat , the lawsuit says ."
one can only wonder who nobel bought it from .
as in the michael flym chant re hilary ?
"is that context for the lock her up , statement ?"
"don't shoot , don't shoot…it's just me john tetpon , native… ."
"age 73 , no weapons , just walking along the street…i'm not muslim and i'm for sure not a rabid babdist bigot…don't shoot… ( though i know for sure i'd get blamed if i wind up dead anyway ."
)  it looks to me like alaska was led to the poor house with out begich at the helm or even in the legislature .
"how did that happen , pray tell ."
right on the money this time john !
"agreed with many of your picks , especially mansbridge , wesley , trudeau ( so sad !"
") , o'leary , can tire's gary ."
won't make much difference however; too many big egos involved .
"i guess you missed the pastor burning obama in effigy , or the non-stop birther garbage , or even the he isn't a real american or christian , or whatever other crap they felt might stick that day ."
"as for kids , they spent a ton of time musing about whether or not the kids were his , so , yeah , unfortunately , the rs really did a ton of this crap ."
"i absolutely agree that kids should be completely off limits , as i said in an earlier comment on this article ."
"lucky y  ( part one of two ) ( springfield , illinois bishop thomas ) paprocki says the enormous outrage shows how strong the lgbt lobby is both in the secular world as well as within the church ."
"or , it shows that most people are not monsters ."
—david badash “would that we had died at the lord’s hand in the land of egypt ( before we came “out” ) as we sat by our fleshpots and ate our fill of bread !
but you ( blessed bishop ) had to lead us into this desert ( without your sacraments and solace ) to make the whole community ( your faithful ) die of famine ( from lack of compassion ) ” ( exodus 16:3 ) .
“the lord gave them ( lgbt and the rest of the grumbling faithful ) bread from heaven” ( psalm 78:24b ) .
"does judge malcolm meet the bilingual requirement of the trudeau government , as it is not mentioned in the article ."
"a little off topic here , but i study the use/effects/relationship of alcohol among the alaska native population and a theory that i posit is: most mainstream people are 12-15 the first time they see a heavily intoxicated person , and they don't see a family member or close adult imbibe to excess until they are maybe in their 20's ."
"in rural alaskan villages , most people have very early memories of seeing an intoxicated person and have seen a close family member or adult friend intoxicated by the time they reach the age of 5 - this says as much about the family and community demographics of rural alaska as it does the amount of alcohol consumed ."
but do you think these factors combined may affect the way the alaska native community sees/accepts/interacts-with alcohol ?
i would hope that the residents of the river road area would now know to be alert to spin and to read and understand the fine print on future proposals for neighborhood changes and rezoning .
but after all these years just one thing .
and he can go back to being a stand-up insult comic .
you actually believed that all of humanity spoke a common language before some mythical event called the tower of babel ?
"dennis , that is my exact reaction ."
"if neko is being railroaded out and our resident conservative snipers stay , there is something rotten in the system ."
i personally am up to my eyeballs in being instructed on the fine points of the catechism or od's 'way' .
"i have read the catechism , i don't need it thrown in my face as the ultimate in truth because it isn't ."
i wish civil comments would automatically remove posts which quote the catechism .
if people want that they can go to catholic answers .
the tolerance for that kind of mind numbing post is pretty much destroying my desire to comment in this system .
more likely a whistle blower on fraudulent gas mileage claims for the weaponize vehicles sold to the worst human rights violator in the world .
this is a very interesting observation .
"i was under the impression that the canonical process for selecting bishops has never been changed since well before v2 , and remains unchanged today ?"
"that is , the current ordinary sends three names to the nuncio , who investigates and forwards his info to the congregation for bishops which selects and forwards that choice to the pope for confirmation ?"
"what did change , as i understand it , is ( 1 ) only the guidance give by each pope to his nuncio and the congregation , and ( 2 ) the abnormal practice of jp2 and b16 to reject the names on the terna in favour of others , just vitiating the last vestige of local input into the process ."
"i am against racism , not for it ."
why are you under the impression that my being the first to say brown skinned people means it's not valid ?
that's what the silly border wall is all about .
that's what ice roundups are all about .
and that's why sanctuary in churches is suddenly a bad principle to right wingers .
"you know it , i know it ."
so nothing at all is wrong with me .
"answer , because of lawmakers like this one ."
"somalia immigrant ilhan omar , muslim , in minnesota , sworn into office with the quran , who pushed to get life insurance payouts to family of terrorists who die during the islamist acts of terror ."
"and muslim huma abedin ( hillary's gal ) -huma abedin's dad , syed abedin , was a firm defender of sharia law ."
"keep in mind , there is a history on islam and how they do get entrenched in what was a westernized culture ."
better get on your knees and pray to jesus for that balance because right now mother nature is in control and she's not happy .
"that millions of palestinians have languished in refugee camps abroad that and the ease with which terrorists in the middle east - isis , al qaeda , - are able to use the occupation of the west bank to recruit new fighters must suggest to reasonable people that the current policies of the israeli state are a permanent incitement to terror and violence in the middle east , northern africa and around the world ."
those policies only exacerbate the threat to jewish people world wide that they were proposed to eliminate .
and most versions of zionism are far more sophisticated than this false equivalence .
the rise in lake levels has nothing to do with global warming .
it was only a few years ago that people were panicking over the extremely low water level of the great lakes .
if science cannot predict the variation in lake levels over a 5 year horizon how can it possibly predict where climate ( and sea level ) will be in 20 or 50 years .
"well - god is sovereign over life and death , that is clear in the bible ."
that does not make the parents choices in this matter right or wrong .
that is not contradictory to believe that .
"i personally believe they were wrong , but do not know what they think ."
i just hope this same standard is applied to trump .
all trump is doing is rallying his opposition .
"build better and cheaper ships here - palani , show me one hawaii shipyard capable of building a commercial container ship ."
"after the merchant marine acts of 1920 and 1936 , all plans to build the shipyards at hawaii were scraped and other states got the federal funding to build the shipyards ."
"admirable , the only states that benefit from the merchant marine acts of 1920 and 1936 are ( ship building and some repairs ) louisiana , ( ship building and repairs ) virginia , ( main port of entry to u ."
", democrats labor union dockworkers , warehousemen's , longshoremen's unions ."
"jobs that used to be at hawaii ) california republic , as paid for by the citizens living at paradise since the u ."
"territory of puerto rico , and other paradises ."
"you want this to be fair , sure slap the paradise tariffs on the other 49 u ."
the ultimate criticism of white privilege as a concept is that when it is implemented into a policy it ends up corrupting groups and individuals identified as non-white by advancing and promoting them with less merit than what reality demands .
in short the effects of anti privilege policy is corruption and a social scandal .
it's also at base an illegitimate concept for a liberal democracy to hold .
"which makes one wonder , are we really living in a liberal democracy ?"
"in my estimation , not entirely , a patina of social dirigisme and authoritarianism has crept in ."
a major danger in using highly abstractive methods in political philosophy is that one will succeed merely in generalizing one’s own local prejudices and repackaging them as demands of reason .
the study of history can help to counteract this natural human bias .
"raymond geuss , “neither history nor praxis , ” outside ethics ( princeton: 2005 ) , pp ."
"the state gop mirrors the national circus - supports trump who is not a republican , a president that hijacked the party body politic just like the other non republican factions that make up the mob including the freedom caucus and tea partiers joe miller and sarah palin ."
"news releases issued by dhs listed crimes for which immigrants were arrested , but did not detail how many people had no convictions or how many entered the country after the jan ."
"1 , 2014 date set by obama ."
the type of crime also matters .
"under obama , the priorities were those who had committed at least one felony or a misdemeanor of significance — such as drunk driving or dealing drugs — or three misdemeanors ."
"according to ice's website , 99 ."
3 percent of ice removals in 2016 clearly met the department of homeland security's priorities .
doesn't exactly read like hypocritical partisan blindness to me .
"you are welcome to read the entire story at mbc latino how ice arrests , deportations under trump could differ from obama by suzanne gamboa as opposed to a 70 year old potusa having a 47 year old wife ?"
"70 - 47 =23 64 - 39 = 25 it must be pathetic for the left wingers to ignore the job losses that have come after forcing huge min wage raises as has happened in the usa , where in the north west , restaurants laid off people and in la stores have been closing and moving !"
", , , however liberal corrupt sheep and propagandist playing economist will continue to perpetuate the lie that it does no harm when clearly this 30% will see many lose their jobs and the economy shrink as we all have less buying power with prices soaring http://www ."
com/minimum-wage-leads-to-job-losses-2017-3 all the really matters in my view is that they are 3-1 heading into a well needed bye week .
they can work on the problem areas but it's not great to see that seimian is really regressing .
he runs into sacks and holding calls .
he's starting to get the deer in the headlights look and he's holding onto the ball afraid to make a play .
i was a supporter of his and thought he would do well but he's not at all .
bad development with osweiler as the only other option .
"wow , it’s a great pleasure to read this post and to know about these flash cards ."
it will be best for my kids .
recently i had bought for me some educational flashcards from carddia .

now i am looking forward to buying some of these cards mentioned here for my kids .
"michael , don't think the princes ( we need to eliminate that regal obsolete term ) have gotten the message from pope francis about serving others ."
it would be a positive gesture .
how does this attrition rate compare to decrease in the numbers of practicing catholics ?
"meaning , if the challenge to make the faith appealing to children of mixed marriages similar to that of keeping people in the faith ?"
"if people grow up with an acceptable alternative to catholicism - rather than being indoctrinated by parents who guilt trip you , it appears that the preferred alternative is to leave ."
"the pastoral suggestion to pay special attention needs to be paid by the church to children of mixed marriages so that catholicism is presented in an attractive way that does not alienate the child by belittling should be applied to all children , and the disgraceful but deeply rooted practice to belittle any deviation from the mainstream should forever be abandoned ."
"you need new revenue anytime you lose your main income source , however a lot does need to be scaled back before we have a solvent way of declaring how much is needed you wouldn't look for the lowest source of revenue possible you look for who will pay you the most hence in essence that's what walker is doing with the pfd restructuring he's ( looking at what will pay the most ."
the problem with that theory is that rather than a job the income is coming out of alaskans pockets .
majority of that income flows into the local businesses and is the way rural alaskans supplement their year of survival .
restructuring doesn't help if we're putting a vast majority of more people on welfare .
i'm describing the ones who basically live at just above poverty level .
"just what we need - another fat , balding geezer with tattoos and a noisy motorcycle ."
so the federal government is giving 60 million dollars to wataynikaneyap power so they can supply power to a first nation that is a part owner of wataynikaneyap power .
we should let the people decide in 2020 .
all wonderful and noble words but canada loves to talk the talk and rarely walks the walk .
the recent federal report on science is particularly disturbing in its conspicuous lack of attention to the north .
"canada has the largest area of tundra on the planet and glaciers , sea ice and permafrost are in a serious and rapid state of reduction ."
and this reflects changes that affect the entire global energy balance and drives changes in atmospheric circulation that is now impacting all areas outside the arctic .
"yet , arctic science in canada has been ravaged during the past three decades with research grants reaching levels so low that even veteran researchers can't afford to work in their own country ."
for more than four decades even parliamentary committees have called for a canadian polar policy to guide our vision and commit resources .
"embarrassingly , canada is the only northern nation lacks a policy , lagging far behind britain , the us , norway , even wee finland !"
i'm a big fan of steve fields .

citizen voices are not restricted from being heard .
the results from those voices calling for illegal and unconstitutional acts is .
"that 9th circuit court opinion does not mean the state law is unconstitutional , it just means that some judges decided their agenda / judicial activism , in their opinion , outweighed the state sovereignty ."
and they knew it would be more of a pain to the states to continue appeals .
"states have limited resources , just like the supreme court has limited resources to act on all constitution related cases appealed to them ."
other news sources say the us missiles did not target the stored illegal chemical weapons for fear of their contamination of innocents .
why would we say that if we thought there were none there ?
"evidently some or all of those 17 intelligence agencies aligned against all countries know where the poisons are stored , that they exist ."
will be interesting how long this presidency can keep making it up as they go there really does not seem to be any coherent strategy behind their decisions other than attempting to appease their unappeasable base .
"keep an eye on that 300k in incremental transgender related expenses , before it balloons just like most other line items trudeau touches ."
and keep an eye on the overall deficit number this fiscal - if canada is the fastest growing economy in the g7 then a large deficit and tax hikes are absolutely inexcusable .
and how is an amendment to the very successful montreal protocol that effectively eliminated the production of cfcs within six years of its adoption not part of the real world ?

i hadn't known that jesus said anything about mercy vs .
a question for you: what does jesus say about mercy vs .
"i know that in the next world , we won't stand a chance if jesus is pure justice ."
we'll all be in a beggar's posture .
but tell me how you think that equation works out in this life .
"the question is important to me , because i was a career prosecutor ( now retired ) always seeking to secure justice while also trying to extend mercy ."
i was rarely satisfied that i got it right .

i get that people get upset about the other side .
"but when faced with the status quo and the unkown well , we have a pretty good idea where that unknown will lead ."
too bad the gop couldn't get it's act together while it had a few of the better candidates left .
jc: i think the gang problem is more of a city responsibility than a state responsibility .
"lazy junkies are the norm , it seems lately ."
i have to be amused by both the bible ostriches and the atheist laputans .
the ostriches simply deny that anything has ever been learned since biblical times .
the laputans airily dismiss thousands of years of lived religious experience--including countless geniuses and creators--as completely irrelevant .
"simply on their faces , both are ridiculous positions ."
"i am not myself a believer in any specific religion , but i have been deeply shaped by two and learned valuable lessons from them all ."
i suspect pat that if we oppose everything that trump does that is horrific there won't be much time or energy left to support him .
think your piece is well meaning and essentially a lost cause .
"trump plan: making america great again , one white nationalist at a time !"
"a well-regarded psychologist and university researcher , philippe rushton , wrote about race and evolution ."
"race is a fantasy , so you say ."
"i just love the non-sequitur of the dissent written by chief justice john roberts: clinicians , not judges , should determine clinical standards , and judges , not clinicians , should determine the content of the eighth amendment ."
sounds profound until you unpack it .
"as roberts demands , in atkins v ."
"virgina , scotus did determine the content of the eighth amendment ( as state in this article , executing the intellectually disabled violated the eighth amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment ) , and that judicial determination created the need for psychologists to establish clinical standards to measure intellectual disability ."
"the majority ruling , it seems to me , asserts that the lower courts did not do that , but rather substituted the judgement of lawmakers rather than for the latest judgement of clinicians as roberts et al ."
"would , on my analysis , have it ."
kellie leitch supporters are banking on wasp hatred to get her elected leader .
have a problem with your sloppy 400 hundred years .
"van r and co arrived in 1652 and whites only got control , direct or indirect , of the whole of s ."
africa somewhere around the end 1800's .
thus if your 400 rears of apartheid is true who was doing the apartheid in the huge part of s .
"africa not inhabited by whites , up to about 1880 ?"
"a few weeks ago saw a short bit on viet nam , a pom i think was touring and doing a mini documentary ."
"he asked a few people about their view on colonialism ( about 400 years of chinese , 150 years of french and a bloody destructive 10 year+ war with the usa ) and all shrugged it off as past and looked the future ."
perhaps whites should openly recognise the 100 -400 years of destructive apartheid and ask blacks to clearly articulate how we should go forward .
seems most whites want to forget/forgive and most blacks want to be trapped in the past .
"time we talked to each other not at , heard each other especially whites and agreed a way forward directed by blacks ."
but are we doing anything about the 'moose' 'lamb' problem ?
i'm sorry but your timeline is wrong and your rationalizations are faulty .

the stadium didn't even open until 1995-- do you really think that businesses suddenly popped up only *after* the stadium was completed ?
go back and read articles during the years between 1990 and 1995 and educate yourself .
it was inevitable even in the 1970s when bill saslow did the blake street bath and racquet club and showed people could live in the warehouse district .
"--no , it wasn't inevitable at all ."
"in fact , the development in lower downtown during that period contributed to the demolition of historic buildings to accommodate parking , and people were *already* living down there because the rents were cheap ."
that's the prime job of our intellect .
to make judgments and comparisons about things .
it's odd how the don't judgers fill up the pages here with their own judgments .
thats one reason why so many catholics have lost a sense of sin .
they've bought into the language of the therapists .
you hear them saying things like this: “how can something be a sin if doesn’t hurt anybody ?
” “how can it be a sin if it is done in the privacy of my own bedroom ?
"” “it used to be a sin , but it's no longer a sin !"
” i'm no longer in love .
i don't feel love for this person anymore .
“we are not hurting anybody” “we were born that way” stop judging ( or judge much ?
) “it’s none of your business” fix yourself first how can a catholic cast a vote for abortion ?
so now have a 10 cents a gallon tax on gas which further increases the gap between what w pay ad the average in the lower 48 .
once a politician gets their hands on your money they never let go .

the differences between what clapper reportedly said and what trump said on twitter have been widely reported elsewhere .
what trump said is not what clapper said or did .
why doesn't this issue go on the ballot when the mayoralty election comes up ?
the city of san diego held a vote whether to agree to a hotel surtax that would be raised to pay for a new stadium for the chargers .
the citizens voted no-and that was it ( the chargers have subsequently left for los angeles and ultimately will play in a >90% privately financed stadium that they will share with the rams ) --so nenshi--put it to a vote as to whether the citizens of calgary want their tax $$ spent to finance such a venture ?
there has always been tension between the two groups but until the us invaded iraq and deliberately excacerbated those tensions they have not actually been killing each other for centuries .
in this case is is the right thing to do i understand what you are saying .
and i'm curious how they got these folks to come in in the first place .
"however , i believe the chronic , dysfunctional homeless population this is designed for is also the costliest in terms of public services and public safety ."
for that reason i think it's worth a try .
"i would like to see some tough love in getting them into treatment for mental illness and stabilizing them to see how much they can progress , and of course getting them indoors under supervision is the only practical way to do that ."
"i am concerned this program may go too far in allowing a self-determination approach , but there has to be something between locking them up in an institution and throwing away the key , and letting them roam the streets in squalor ."
maybe they will find that folks can learn to prefer indoors and be more willing to undergo substance abuse and mental health treatment and stick with the new lifestyle .
i hope the dp follows this closely .
"no pam , that is the point ."
republicans are no longer conservative and do not believe in republican values .

"i think that's also why ash wednesday resonates so deeply , even for those who never otherwise darken the door of a church ."

"building planes is engineering , not science ."
"science is about understanding things , not about making them work ."
"engineering is about making things work , not about understanding them ."
"indeed , most of the science engineering use is grossly inaccurate or just plain wrong - no scientist would touch it with a barge pole , but engineers still use it , because it's close enough to make stuff work ."
conflating the two will not get you accurate conclusions about anything .
"no scientist will ever claim to have the absolute final answer to anything , and even what they are certain off , they continue to further research , believing there are even deeper truths waiting to be found ."
"but for an engineer - either the plane flies or it doesn't , either the bridge stands or it collapses ."
the scientist is happy if we understand better than before .
the engineer is happy if the bridge stays up .
"so , based on your last statement , you have left out the fact that if a student were to shout out to a professor , he/she will run the risk of being removed/suspended/expelled just the same ."

colleges is perhaps maybe where they should be .
but the biggest problem of all is employers not investing in training their people from the bottom up .
i do not understand why companies are not paying more education taxes as they are being heavily subsidized by the taxpayer for an educated workforce .
every time i hear a company complain that they cannot find the right people it means they do not wish to invest in their own people and want someone else to pay for it .

it is not the laws fault the the insurance companies and hospitals are raping the average citizen by charging outrageous prices for medical procedures .
a friend of mine had his child break his ankle last year .
"simply fracture , a cast and split and some pain medication ."
"it cost almost $45 , 000 dollars ."
"the materials involved cost around 100 dollars total , and he was in the doctors office ( out patient visit ) for less than 2 hours ."
"that cost $45 , 000 dollars ."
the same casting/setting of the ankle has an average cost of under $1000 dollars in most other countries .
"keep telling yourself that the aca is the problem , not the hospitals that hid charge master accounts , or the insurance companies that fight tooth and nail to not compete over state lines ."

"i do agree that the unhoused who are mentally ill or unemployed but want to work , need help ."
the rest need to have the welcome mat removed from our town .
now wouldn't this be a great infrastructure project for the feds to invest in ?
nova scotia already has the highest marginal tax rate and one of the highest cost of livings .
"they are paying their fair share besides , pm trudeau promised that his deficit spending strategy was to be for infrastructure and creating jobs , not government opex ."
"from an albertan tvo is good but its entire evenings beyond paikin are mostly comprised of foreign material paikin is getting long in the tooth so even that is not a compelling model for the cbc what we need is a globalized educational network where all national broadcasters exchanges their best shows to distribute through their individual nwtework in the 1930s , canada pretty much closed itself off to immigration because of the great depression ."

hope denver loses all possible federal funding until denver voters and politicians change their tune .
"re wind: i am no expert on tom thompson or the group of seven , but i know douglas firs grow in b ."
"thompson's paintings depict white pines , sometimes jack pines , thus the names of some paintings , pine country and pine island ."
"perhaps feist was thinking of frederick varley's iconic painting , stormy weather georgian bay , which also depicts what is clearly a white pine ."
"oddly , so far these voters who are becoming disillusioned report that they would still vote for trump ."
the lesson learned is that it's not enough to dislike trump .
people need something compelling and relatable as an alternative .
"i hope the dems don't overlook that fact , or they may well have another surprise loss on their hands next time around ."
cabinet ministers are pretty much the same in canada .

it is europe that has been the center of anti-semitism for two thousand years .
it is certainly a matter of preference .

"she is a master of taqiyya , the deception and dissimulation used by muslims against infidels , kafaars , christians and jews to protect islam from scrutiny ."
she knows islam is creating a mess across europe but she will blame the europeans because it is her solemn duty to protect the name of allah and mohammad .
why don't we question the principles and ethics behind all of our laws i think that is a very good idea !
that kind of re-examination should be going on all the time .
in fact that kind of re-examination is what has lead to right to die legislation around the world .
and the removal of laws criminalizing inter-racial marriages .
and changing the law to give natives the vote .
the same kind of re-examination resulted in homosexuality being removed from the dsm as a mental disorder .
good ideas don't need censorship to support them and they don't need to be protected from critical comment .
good ideas can stand up for themselves and/or be rationally supported by well informed people .
edebali has a good chance of making the team because he's a good olb and because of the injury .

there's nothing worse than a boss scolding or criticizing there employee in front of everyone .
"i don't care how much money you have or how you did it in the civilian world , but making this type of statement is one of the most ignorant things you could have said ."
it shows your lack of intelligence in political etiquette .
and it makes you look weak .
how do you expect people to stand behind you when you make statements like this .
this is the kind of crap that's going to make you lose re-election .
because you sure haven't kept most the promises you made during your campaign .
"that's because you , unlike the assailants family and their lawyers , have moral clarity and a brain housing group that isn't holstered in your lower digestive tract ."

"miller , we can argue about statistics and numbers all day , but the primary goal of obamacare was to improve access to health care products and services for nearly 50 , 000 , 000 citizens ."
"some of them can not afford pay for it because they are truly poor , some can change their spending practices and buy coverage , some are willing to go without any coverage and suffer the consequences when the inevitable happens , and some are fortunate to work for the government or private companies who provide health care benefits ."
progressives believe our great country can afford to insure that all citizens have an equal opportunity to receive health care and that the country will be much stronger when we do .
it is an issue of priorities .
"i was very happy when obama courageously led the passage of the affordable care act because even though it is flawed because of compromises necessary to get it through the gotp opposition , it will be impossible to repeal without a less flawed replacement plan ."

"i think accountability and transparency are critical to a functioning democracy , across all ethnicities , and good journalism , as you say , demands all public officials to be accountable and transparent ."
"the places that are less corrupt have better journalism and more safeguards in place , more explicit checks and balances ( human nature demands it ) ."
"the less infrastructure , the less regulations and the more resistance in the way of corrupt practices , the more corruption will happen ."
i think it's really that simple .
"that's where hawaii should focus , on strengthening its safeguards ."
let's leave race out of this .
"since puerto rico is not a state , its citizens ( who also are not white ) are 2nd-class ."

i guess he'll have to try and scripts the media like harper used to do because conservatives can't seem to face the tough questions .

com/words/a-historic-event-or-an-historic-ev motleycrew early comment: to keep blaming everything on obama is not factual and does not address the issue at hand .
1- the japan deal was in effect in october without t-rump .
then it was 100 billion dollars .
so who's getting the other 50 billion ?
2- we should believe t-rump sold his stocks why ?
he has yet to prove he's the billionaire he says he is .
3- he is exaggerating the price of air force one .
is he mad it won't be ready for his administration ?
4- according to politifact t-rump has told the truth 51 times .
so why would anyone believe this moron ?
( this does not include his last month of bs .
)  was his act a disgusting stunt because it offended your sensibilities or because it cut directly to the issue without any way to deny a reality ?

"guns don't kill people , people kill people ."
cue the gun humping snowflakes crying about their fake constitutional rights and calling me too ignorant and stupid to comprehend the issue because i lack detailed technical knowledge of firearm modifications .
then they tell us these massacres ( one on average every 3 or 4 days in america ) are just the price we have to pay so they can be free .
"funny how for gun owners their second amendment rights always trump the right to life , liberty and pursuit of happiness for everyone else ."

"while saving the life of a young child from the islamic state is certainly cause for celebration , lets not get too embroiled in embracing the yazidi culture ."
yazidis ( not unlike the worlds other religions ) are chock full of messed up messages for children who are brainwashed from a young age into medievalism .
"elements of these religious cultures are massively xenophobic , abhorrently ignorant of science and reason , and ultimately destructive to our well being ."
"celebrate the life , but never be afraid to scrutinize the culture ."
"for the 'official' church [hierarchy/clergy] as well as the other 96% of the laity , it can no longer be business as usual' ."
"the church in america is changing---whether it deals with youth who are hispanic [or immigrants from india , china , or syria] , whether it deals with nones , whether it deals with the lgbt community---things are changing ."
"it means that pastors [clergy/arch/bishops , cardinals] , must not only be life-long learners [reading] , but they must keep their fingers on the 'pulse' of their parishes/arch/dioceses ."
"they must also get out among the people---not only the well-to-do and articulate , but among the poor , blue-color middle class and white color middle class ."
dialogue---not monologue from 'on-high' is what building community/evangelization is about .
all---including the pastors----need to learn and grow .
this is just what hell looks like .

"after all what living in america having being a part of his acomplishments to this day he's still not satisfied with what he's gotten being an american , complaining having a foreign black taking away a black american role ."
"being of black heritage he'll always use that to complain , at times and instances i believe he has the right to do that ."
"reminds me of michelle saying , for the first time in my life ."
even if in a great position they'll always use that racial line of defense no matter what because of being on the short end of the stick racial wise .
it's their escape and reason to complain .
no need to complain only as a black american actor being shunned but should have said american actors being shunned .
why is it considered intolerant or racist to speak out against an ideology that is intolerant and racist ?
commoner ------------------ comment of the day it is thus considered because the media is dominated by leftist progressive ideolog love of christ and his church .
"one more thing: he refers to seminary high school , seminary college as well as , seminary ."
not sure what that specifically means .

trans is just one of many disqualifications .
"if you're too short you can't serve either , but you didn't whine about that today ."
"ah , i see your point ."
"but you , like liberals , mistake what repubs really want ."
you haven't gone back far enough .
what we want is what the framers gave us .
we want enough government to keep us safe and to do enough other things to make our country run well .
we want fiscal responsibility instead of run away spending .
"we want a strong military and we want lower tax rates , especially corporate rates ."
"some of us are social conservatives , but none of us want gays in the closet ."
we want the first and second amendments to be honored and we want the press to report the news instead of trying to create the news .

when you got on a small plane you had to make a judgement call on things you had little knowledge of .

"marie collins , an irish clergy abuse survivor , said she will not pre-judge pell's guilt or innocence regarding the charges against him ."
but she said francis should not have appointed the cardinal the prefect of the new secretariat of the economy in 2014 .
marie seems to forget it's a long standing fact the vatican takes those under their wing when real danger to the establishment reaches the front door .
"john paul ll was a good example of that with marcial degollado and then argentine bishop , archbishop , cardinal now argentine pope francis and now cardinal pell granted a citizenship within the vatican and under the wing of greg burke the pr mastermind engaged to clean up their image and care of damage control ."
"on the surface at least , a grand effort considering  to trump and his supporters , they were bad as recently as last year ."
he blasted both ted cruz and hillary clinton for being too close to sachs and other wall street firms .
he claimed he was a reformer who wouldn't be beholden to their line of thinking .
"now , his cabinet is stuffed with these types ."
i'd call that a pretty egregious example of both selective outrage and memory .

we have been killing each other forever and we love it and will continue to do it .
what i object to is your notion that natives were somehow immune from this .
they committed as many atrocities against each other and white settlers as they were capable of .
in the end they are simply one group conquered by another .
"once conquered they were given reservations , welfare checks , and health care ."
if it were the genocide you claim it to be then the killing would have continued until there were no more .

"not every child is ready for college at 18 , if ever ."
"sorry , but it is way too late by then ."

what's the meggsy plan for bcs economy ?
you mean the constitutional right that was granted in 1791 when muskets were all the rage and it took minutes to reload one shot ?

"dave , i believe that by having two ilh team be in the same bracket is like playing another league game , as well as for the oia ."
"if that is the case , they should just go back to the prep bowl ."
you're just doing another league playoff for a chance to get to the prep bowl .
maybe it would be better to have less oia teams in the states open division .
instead of having the oia teams declare which division they are playing in .
"just let the oia do as in the past , and play their regular schedule ."
"then have the top 4 teams playoff for the 2 open division spots , as well as oia champions ."
"like york said , open or bust ."
"the oia can benefit from a high drawing game , and get all the revenues ."
the ilh would take their top 2 teams for the open division .
a 4 team open division championship ( ilh #1 vs oia #2 & oia #1 vs ilh #2 ) .
these games will draw the interest of fans .
the other 18 oia teams can qualify for the d1 and d2 tournaments .
"of course , a larger number oia teams will qualify for these ."
i bet you drink coffee eh ?

why do muslim refugees from muslim countries want so desperately to migrant to non muslim countries like canada and the u .

"you're right , but the problem lies with employers , not labor ."
if employers abided by the laws of our nation they would hire through selective programs and pay prevailing wages .
"i am familiar as a former general contractor with immigrants , legal and not , taking construction jobs , but except for raw labor those sometime residents perform semi-skilled jobs at usually high wages , and work much harder than many if not most citizens ."
"an exception is state licensed guild work like plumbing and gas supply systems , which illegal labor can't get ."
i question that those workers have a significant impact on any citizen with good work habits .
"are you aware that socal offered field jobs to citizens at eighteen/hr with transportation to and from the farms , and had few takers and fewer who survived the first day ?"
"and when they express their personal opinions via the ballot , it's called the will of the people ."
the people of port angeles have been absolutely consistent every time we've been given the opportunity to vote on fluoridation -- we don't want it .
"one loon spouting idle threats proves western society is islamophobic , but thousands of islamic terrorists slaughtering thousands of infidels don't represent islam ."
this may be the most idiotic thing i've ever seen .
let's not pretend that false allegations of sexual assault are a common occurrence .
"even the globe's series admits to a rate as high as 8% - and that number comes from provably false accusations , i ."
no doubt about them being false .
and there are studies showing a much higher rate than that .
that is 1 in 12 accusations .
you need to investigate with an open mind before drawing conclusions .
being roman means having a great sense of appreciation and enjoyment of the roman ritual in it's fullness .
"in other words--a liberal use of chant , processions , smells , bells , latin , etc--the whole of the tradition ."
in other words--liking the pageantry of high church worship .
one of the things i like about pope francis is that he prefers simplicity .
he does not have the appreciation for the pageantry that his predecessors had .
"while i do not share his theological ideology , i do appreciate his liturgical sense ."
a lot of the younger clergy tend to have that appreciation for the pageantry .
my point was that there is not necessarily a connection between an appreciation of the roman pomp and being conservative .
one can be high church without being conservative .
just look at the american catholic church or the anglican church .
"they have all the trappings of traditional high church roman pomp , but little to none of the substance of the theology ."
"desouza and arroyo are definitely small potatoes , but not without their own audience who consumes this garbage ."
the same money that supports politicians like twitler also fund this right-wing talk site [ewtn] - so the similarities to foxnews who waged propaganda war against president obama as kenyan-born muslim are understandable .
i hope that someone in the papal household has a copy of this video so that rev .
"gerald murray will get what is coming to him , too ."
burke has already been exiled to malta - which is about the limit of his competency .
shades of catherine of aragon - a queen without a queendom .
"burke has been publicly humiliated by his demotion , and he just can't stand it ."
this is the way politics is played in the curia .
burke's problem is that bergoglio is a better politician than he is .
the corruption of the curia is so entrenched it will take several pontificates to clean out the muck and mire .
"sadly , popes may come and go , but the curia is eternal  she said london and new york have an awful lot in common ."
they both are crime riddled and are neck in neck to see which is the most dangerous .
hispanics and latinos are going to deny trump the presidency .
it's not nice to tell a giant voting block that you're going to keep their relatives out of the good old u .
"of a by , laughably , building a wall ."
"now who was the republican president that said , mr ."
a republican columnist joins the expanding slate of the equally cowardly former trump idolators as they head for the hills .
hoping against hope the nation's populace will forget their basic anti-american stances and policies in favor of all things trump and republican .
"now that the republican party has been exposed for the looting billionaire party that it is and has been extolled in all of the conservative columns , they are trying to save their own traitorous butts in order to return to the back rooms where they can espouse their anti-human , white supremacist , fascist ideology without consequence to their giant earnings for same ."
time to rid this nation of the republican party at all levels .
never to be allowed to govern again .
congratulations to the justin government for setting the same emissions targets as the harper government .

is climate change nothing more then partisan fodder for our confused and simple friends on the left ?
"regarding the poor clock management at the end of the first half , some of that is on siemian as he ran out of bounds on a second down play when he should have slid feet first to keep the clock rolling or to force the bills to use one of their timeouts ."
at the time when he ran out of bounds i was sort of incredulous thinking like wth is trevor doing ?
i'm more wary of socialist humanities department college professors more than anyone else .
"we just got 8 years of that - almost destroyed the countri i'm not a huge fan of hoa's , but if i was considering buying a home next to a house with that much stuff in the yard , i probably wouldn't buy it ."
"ccs has supposedly prevented this amount , ya , at a cost of $1 ."
"at 67 tonnes per person in saskatchewan alone , that is between 1 and 2 percent ."
"you do the math , pal and tell me how cost-effective that is ."
your assertion regarding bc is incorrect and misleading .
"in any event , christy clark has shown little interest in fighting climate change ( is a net enemy of the environment in fact ) and has thus mismanaged the bc scheme for several years now ."
"hey globe and mail , could you please stop running that video picture of o'leary at the end of every story about the conservative leadership race ?"
wonderful and yet we see his picture rather than bernier's .
o'leary should thank you for all the free advertising space .
i do know someone who was not affected .
but you right about equifax that's how they got hacked .
canada's military is underresourced and has been for more than 20 years .
major procurements have been repeatedly pushed off into the future .
this had serious consequences when we sent troops to afghanistan and the lav troop carriers canada had made them sitting ducks to ieds .
"during the decade that the harper tories were in power , they kept deferring major defence expenditures and starving the caf of operational funds in order to meet their deficit targets ."
the tories compensated with a sanctimonious showiness about troop fatalities which dovetailed nicely with their pitch to fight islamic terrorism .
"now that the trudeau liberals are at the helm , the shell game continues ."
the only trump card that canada can offer the americans is that canadian troops are literate and well-trained .
"useful cannon fodder , is another way of putting it ."
"domestically , is there an appetite for spending on defence , just ask canada's middle class if they would agree to tax increas ben harper will lead the way ."
remember: the first action of the current congress was to loosen restriction of self-declared mentally ill people to possess firearms .
current and former officials said either trump lacks an understanding of the fbi's role as an independent law enforcement agency or does not care about maintaining such boundaries .
"there was absolutely no question under harper that every senator that he appointed was a partisan conservative , sworn to work for pmsh ."
trudeau has appointed senators who have no obvious political allegiances .
"the only obvious exception was harder himself but trudeau had no choice because the constitution requires that there be a government leader in the senate and if there is such a post , surely to god that person must support or represent the government !"
"somebody explain to me , please , how a gay or trans person threatens anyone's marriage like actual marital discord does ."
"john , i am sure you thank god for tv , when you can change the channel if rick comes on and watch one of those great us shows !"
i am happy that you don't make the decisions on what we see on cbc !
motve: he was an outspoken athiest who hated christians .
"since 1934 , congress has strictly regulated the manufacture , transfer , and possession of machine guns ."
the firearms are regulated by the 1934 national firearms act ( nfa ) ( 26 usc § 5801 et seq .
) ---------------- we've had gun control for automatic weapons for 83 years .
no citations given for “studies show” equals urban myth .
"the most thorough studies to date indicate that liberalization of concealed carry laws is associated with increases in violent crime , particularly aggravated assault ( donohue et al 2014 , 2017 ) ."
no research has yet found a net protective benefit to owning or carrying a gun .
"if you carry a gun , you should also carry gauze and a tourniquet ."
"this was all too predictable , this legislative majority has been posturing for over six months now , and it's not done yet , nor will it be until after the november elections ."
"they have more delay tactics than carter has liver pills , this majority is not about to piss off the voters in their respective districts by making the hard decisions , for fear of being replaced ."
pretty chicken sh1t that they can actually rationalize taking our money and give it to the oil companies .
so you really have no excuse for trumps bizarre comments .
you're ok with the president of the united states boasting about his 'accomplishments' in the sack .
that works well for your church ?
that works well for wife and daughters ?
that works well for the son you are trying to teach sexual responsibility .
"you're not that big a jerk and i say this with all honesty , trump is making you look bad ."
"muslim have been singled out for a very long time , by trump , yourself and millions of others ."
the democrats offered a very different image of a muslim couple that showed their own family commitment to our nation .
you don't understand why that's important to other muslim americans ?
it's important to break the stereotype of all muslims being terrorist and stiop blaming those that aren't guilty of any crime .
i think it's criminal that the speed limit downtown and in busy parts of midtown isn't 25 mph like all other civilized cities .
5th avenue is unforgivably dangerous to pedestrians because of the speeds people drive .
she is exactly why trump won .
and they wonder why we hate them .
"awesome send a messag you are lucky enough to live in alaska , the black bears are a minimal problem ( and i spend a lot of time in the woods ) , so learn to live with them ."
black bears are not a pest .
they are wildlife that deserve to live in this area just the same as we do .
"btw , i have gone to kincaid park for 26 years and never once have i seen a black bear lots of moose but not one black bear ."
"sure keep fighting from your desks , secure that the bullets and bombs and other destruction that you authorise will not affect you personally ."
wouldn't it be great if those who start and perpetuate these conflicts be required to direct them from inside the conflict zones in the company of their families ?
and a sleep - over  a commie jew like ( ( ( weintraub ) ) ) trying to restrict freedom of speech for the filthy goyim ?
"i'm shocked , i tell you , shocked !"
sam lono passed away long ago ?
"come on now , this is fake stuff being used by culture hustlers to symbolically replace the real with the artifice for a fee ."
nainoa is not the leader of the native hawaiian people except in his own mind .
this is a false statement: traditional knowledge and training died out long ago .
i know a lot of native hawaiians this would come as news to .
that could be because no one at the time had enough industrial activity to pollute it .
it probably wasn't a moral environmental decision as you imply .
you really believe that pope francis is walking the walking ?
which brings up the lack of dynamics in universities these days .
there is little discussion anymore in classes because the students are shy or they do not have the english skills for expressing opinions or diverse thoughts .
"this leads to silent classrooms for the other 75% of the students who see dialogue , critical thinking and problem solving as positive as just not being there ."
we didn't ban people en masse from specific countries after the 9/11 attacks when there was an actual reason to be fearful .
there has been no terrorist attacks so there was no need for these restrictions .
it is a thinly veiled ploy by the alt-right to begin restricting muslim immigration and to give trump's racist and uneducated hardcore supporters the scapegoat and two minute hate that they want .
"a true idiot , and pius x , an authoritarian paranoid ."
"more seriously , the two popes listed claimed to love vatican ii while working against it ."
the bishops cited have tried to turn the church into an arm of the republican party .
there is much to ridicule in that .
their archaic view of homosexuality in a time where it is not disorder but simply a natural variation is not the charity the church stands for .
we are not operating under some kind of pc dream when simply stating the truth that the church was in error in condemning their sexuality ( both as a trait and as practiced ) .
"his hands are full with the priests : )  [we should condemn their ideology through starvation of attention , not silencing them ."
] the problem is that doesn't work .
the us tried that while wwii raged in europe and asia .
i agree with you that speaking hate is not the same as acting on it but i cannot deem it peaceful if it's very purpose is to disrupt the peace and spread such beliefs to others .
"[regarding white supremacists , my take was that he lumped all of the whites first/whites only groups as white supremacists ."
"] so why do you think trump said , some of those people were not white supremacists by any stretch ?"
he made some clear distinctions in regards to the protesters that i just cannot fathom how he reached .
they somehow wanted to protest the taking down of a statue robert e .
"lee but the only plausible reason is because of glorifying what robert e lee stood for , ie ."
defending the slave trade in the seceding us states .
[erase our history] is that erasing to just not glorifying ?
these ideas are so toxic that they cannot even be discussed in our politically correct and leftist-stifled world .
that is mostly what the political correctness movement has been about since it arose back in the 1980s .
"and yes , it is an active and muscular movement , originating in sectors of university campuses , aiming to silence unwanted voices , to silence ideas and analyses deemed dangerous to the wanted movement , unwanted brakes impeding the wanted sociopolitical end points ."
the columnist has hit the nail on the head .
oh look they cried and whined and got what they wanted - who didn't see that one coming ?
"this nonsense needs to stop , let's make canada christian again ."
"trump's like a crab that's put in a kettle of cold water on a stove and then the cook ( pollsters ) gradually turn up the heat , all the while giving the crab a false impression that he's safe ."
there is a large silent majority in canada just waiting for a party with radical views if one emerges they will win the election .
zgrey: i'm not sure canadians want a radical party of any sort .
"rather , i suspect most would support a rational and open party that objectively serves the broadest interests of the canadian public rather than one that panders to the interests of corporations , billionaires and lobbyists ."
i think many canadians would welcome the opportunity to have input on public policy relating to supposedly 'decided' issues like immigration and multiculturalism .
"public debate can be messy but it's generally more honest than having contentious matters decided by small groups of politicians , donors , lobbyists and political operatives who apparently think themselves more enlightened than the rest of us ."
at least you didn't counter with another round of drain the swamp .
com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2017/10/19/its-on-senate-judiciary-will-investigate-clinton-russia-corruption-n2397354 he worries 'jouissance' has something to do with the jews .
"there are hundreds of coaching programs out there , churning out qualified coaches ."
"to ensure a level of training and practice has occurred , your coach should be a member and certified with the international coaches federation , which has strict education and practice credentials enforced on its membership ."
there is a difference between a weekend coaching program and a year long one .
"also , choose a coach that specializes in careers , not everything , as many do ."
perhaps alaska delegation members can tell us why they are silent on trump's statement that he would recognize crimea as russian and lift sanctions on moscow imposed after its 2014 annexation of the ukrainian territory .
"trump was asked about that yesterday , and said: “yes ."
we would be looking at that .
"” you realize that over time , problems become more pronounced ."
"we're near the end of the dollar , not the beginning ."
"make n o mistake , between gerrymandering and voter suppression , the ultra far right is trying to guarantee itself a permanent electoral majority ."
he won't save a single life .
"in fact , this is not about saving lives it is nothing more than another tax grab ."
just the wives w cheetolini getting a strap on from all .
"the scotus is why , i believe , the presidential race should be above the fold , top , & center ."
"should hillary , & her flying monkeys occupy the white house , we can rest assured that her scotus nominees will be no friend of liberty in general , & gun rights in particular ."
she’d hailed the cab at 1 .
she was discovered by the constable 11 minutes later .
is everyone aware of this little bit of fact ?
"bigots , racists , nazi's , white supremacists , evangelicals , and some good people lol , part of the normal republican party these days ."
"and i heard this from reliable sources , special agent mueller is going to pop trump's a** soon ."
"imua , aloha & mahalo reading through the bs - the kochs realize the gop needs to stop getting on the wrong side of social issues ."
"an overwhelming majority of americans now favor pot legalization , especially medical marijuana ."
like many issues demographics show a tough future for the gop and its conservative stances on issues like drugs and gay rights .
a crackdown on marijuana could lead to ugly election results in 2018 and 2020 for the gop .
as a cradle catholic i take exception to your article .
i have attended the sspx chapel in livonia michigan since 1997 .
"it gives me the traditional latin mas and sacraments that the church had for 2000 years , minus the liberal modernist heresy condemned by pope st ."
pius x in 1907 in his encyclical which made modernism a heresy .
rome has followed this heresy since vatican ii although most catholics don't realize it .
i suggest those who may be interested is this matter go to the chapel in veneta and speak to the pastor .
you can also go to their website at: www .
my university has a whole office devoted to screening fake paper qualifications and it's very busy .
time to thank the leadership for the total sell out of alaska to the oil industry  don't put words in my mouth .
i did not say that a christianized land lacks free choice .
"the us was once thought to be a christian nation but that did not exclude people from other traditions to live here ( however , it made it difficult for some then as it does now !"
it is amazing that your god always hates the exact same thing as you .
even when nothing was said about it in your bible .
so not wwjd but what would blue eyes european republican jesus ( tm ) do ?
and the state senate regressives who decided not to let you vote on roads funding .
it's not what wbc believes that offends me .
it's how they go about expressing it .
"wbc is not gathering souls to christ , they are driving souls away ."
"who wants to be associated with such an hateful god , as their example portrays him ?"
"sure , god hates sin , and does not excuse it , but he gently persuades souls to repentance ."
wbc wants to bully everyone into adhering to their version of religion .
"yes , theirs is a religion based on fear and oppression , not on faith/trust in christ ."
"if trump loses , he will easily become the new grand wizard of the ku klux klan ."
every profession has their quack the rest of the country ( most of it ) is mostly muslim .
"malaysia ( muslim officially ) celebrates christian , hindu and buddhist holidays ."
"it is not hard to understand , 200k people arrive need a place to live they take up houses or apartments means less for the rest ."
pushes people to buy their own houses with low interest mortgages .
he was one of canada's greats .
"of course , cardinal reinhard we are not a subsidiary of rome marx neglects to mention the pope owes loyalty to christ as well , as pope benedict taught: the power of teaching in the church involves a commitment to the service of obedience to the faith ."
the pope is not an absolute monarch whose thoughts and desires are law .
"on the contrary , the pope's ministry is a guarantee of obedience to christ and his word ."
he must not proclaim his own ideas .
rather constantly bind himself and the church to obedience to god's word in the face of every attempt to adapt it or water it down and every form of opportunism .
” the move to renewable energy is fact .
all power stations have a life and must be shut down at some point i believe a few are candidates now due to the high cost of maintenance .
"the article highlights on time , foreign investment , job growth and most importantly skills growth for our people ."
why must we miss out on this trend because we are in africa it is time to stand up and become a leader .
actually you see the little ear pieces everyone has .
the winner was announced and all of a sudden the powers to be said no they are not black so they had to quickly substitute .
"it is unfortunate , but it may not be all bad ."
the trade imbalance might improve and we may have a reason to reconsider the upcoming dec .
i actually liked his campy style rather than the darker style of today's movies .
he also had a small part in robinson crusoe on mars .
the basis of insincerity is the idealized image we hold of ourselves and wish to impose on others .
i'm no expert but have had basic oil fire training .
the foam is used as a cooling curtain to allow firefighters to get in close and shut off valves and isolate the fire .
yet another example of below average management of our state and city leaders .
not enough or strong enough shelters is just the start .
"if oahu gets a direct hit by a cat iii or higher: 1 ) how many weeks without power , communications and fresh water ?"
2 ) how long before gas stations and stores open ?
3 ) how long will it take resources coming from the mainland to rescue us ?
"4 ) how many months , years before rebuilding to take place while awaiting for insurance and competent contractors ?"
5 ) where will everyone stay while waiting years to rebuild ?
we are not ready for a big natural disaster and the lack of shelters is just one of many aspects of this problem .
maybe amazon will sell mini homes for the vancouver workers .
everytime a driver activates a cell phone ( or something equally distracting ) a sharp spike emerges from the center of the steering wheel .
they can then continue with their choice .
people claiming to be devout agnostics or atheists .
i can only assume tongues are in cheeks .
anyone who understands science shouldn't be devout anything .
modern science helps us understand that knowledge is a never-ending quest and that faith is folly .
"it's going to take hours and hours to peruse all the news articles about von freyberg , burke's demotion in 2014 and statements by kofm officials themselves regarding the issues between festing and boeselager ."
i'll qualify that statement about the 13 cardinals to refer to non-catholic media .
my point was that it was covered by the intra-catholic media as would have been the whole kofm story if the name of the boogeyman burke been mentioned .
"the proud boys is a group of loosely-affiliated , low-information neo-nazi crybaby trolls ."
we can see where your sympathies lie; too bad you're too much of a snowflake to attach your name to your risible comment .
"well okay then , but you are officially off the debating team ."
the statistical nuance that keeps the officials from declaring a pot emergency will be lost on the average voter .
"add in the rise in crime and a parallel trend in the other legalized state ( wa ) , and this is trouble ."
"this could be one major bummer , dudes ."
"when i worked for my diocese , there existed a catholic black list , compiled by , i believe , the usccb ."
"diocesan funds were not to be invested in these companies , including retirement funds ."
i bet the k of c funds are treated differently because of who sponsors that fund .
"well karan , you show wisdom that you are going to take hits for your comments but no wisdom in your claim that your god is the only source of proper human behavior ."
the sanctimonious claims made by hyper christians are offensive to clear thinking reasonable and rational thinkers .
i am sure there is more to this than just charlottesville .
"maybe the rebel started out as an attempt to provide a voice for fiscal and social conservatism , but it degenerated into the kind of alt right nonsense that donald trump tacitly endorses ."
when your main purpose is hate and fear you have to take a good hard look at yourself and see if you really want to be involved in that .
a recent news report on bbc world confirmed exactly what you say .
japan imposes no import duty on dinosaur us cars while the us does charge an import tax on japanese cars .
problem is gas guzzling cadillac escalades don't exactly fit on japanese roads or japanese budgets .
214monteal needs to get his facts right before repeating us trade propaganda .
the quality of the cars says it all .
"you know , the only candidates running this fall who were party to this are the incumbents in the republican majority ."
why do they deserve to be returned to juneau ?
i will say that i think joel is at fault for what happened .
"i'm having trouble reconciling the idea that joel taught his family about guns and gun safety yet , after sleeping with a gun , gets up and leaves it on the bed ."
"tina says that the gun killed kimi , not jaxson ."
"unfortunately , jaxson did kill kimi because guns can't act on their own ."
"had the gun not been left on the bed by joel , jaxson wouldn't have been able to get it ."
joel should have been charged because he left that gun lying around and his irresponsible behavior resulted in the death of his great-granddaughter .
i read about people being arrested for this same thing but i don't understand why he wasn't .
he is a perfect example of a person who should not own guns .
joel left a loaded gun on a bed and it resulted in the death of your daughter .
"yes amanda , you do have someone to blame ."
"if you're saying it has come 48 hours too late , you are correct ."
"the white supremacists appear to have understood the timing , too ."
what's really ridiculous is the us widow asking for $125 million for compensation .
what khadr did on the battlefield is a separate issue from the torture he suffered while the canadian government sat by and did nothing .
"i don't like khadr , but he confessed to a crime and spent the time in gitmo for it ."
"a drunk , well educated adult killed six people ( three generations worth ) in toronto , and only got eight years in prison ."
you are conflating the church's teaching with christ's teaching !
"we have already learned much about this pope , including the fact that he does not pull out a clean handkerchief every time a right-wing cardinal , created by a predecessor-pope , sneezes or blows his [sic] nose ."
i've never been much for the pageantry and fetishizing of symbols .
probably because i was raised by christians who viewed such displays as bordering on golden calf kind of idolatry and actually close to blasphemy .
"probably why i don't mind wearing the flag , even though that technically violates the codes established for such pageantry , etc ."
"i happen to /like/ the flag , but i don't accord it the same magical properties others might ."
"if i was returning from such a conflict , i doubt it'd bother me , in truth ."
"if i did react emotionally and irrationally and someone ended up dead , i sure hope a jury would convict ."
to not do so would be to encourage lawlessness and vigilantism and general thuggery .
i have been to nederland a lot of times on business .
"it really is the most tolerant and egalitarian country in europe , maybe in the world ."
"now they are facing a real challenge , integrating people who cannot be integrated because of their religion ."
khomeini said it loud and clear: the sharia is our law and islam must rule by it .
so holland now is in this unique position of being more and more at unease in their own wonderful country .
"here the effect is nearly zero , except in quebec where they still believe in harmonious integration ."
"they should travel , feel the world , feel the brits , the dutch , the belgians and the germans ."
they get the refugees their own islamic powers like saudi arabia and iran will not even consider .
turkey takes in a lot of syrians which are historically their blood and integrate them well to have a more powerful population base against the kurds .
an immense organized invasion by islam .
this people need help but ontario government ( lead by lesbian ) cancel this program that was covered by ohip this nation was pioneered and founded by people of european values .
"today , we have many who want to attack that foundation ."
"catholics and christians are losing the rights to practice their religion , the gvt ."
"should not be forcing anyone to bake cakes , or penalize anyone who upholds their religious moral values ."
i'm not sure that's what she meant .
"i got the impression she had reservations about people taking the law into their own hands , but she wasn't clear with such a brief response ."
"bradley's response isn't clear also , but seems a bit more worrying ."
clearly it is a case of ophthamological appropriation .
"waste in government is certainly a conversation to have , but if that conversation is going to make meaningful change , it has to be about government as a whole , not just poking at things liberals or conservatives don't like ."
"basically , the dod needs to be looked at as hard as medicare ."
"oh , come on , steve bloss !"
"gardner is nothing more than a shill for that egomaniac , trump ."
"hmmm but when jpii and benny were popes , their every sigh and belch were considered an infallible teaching ?"
why this sudden change of heart ?
"we liberals were told in no uncertain terms to suck it up buttercup , roma locuta , causa finita est !"
"sounds like a backroom deal doesn't it , trudeau no doubt a soro's lackey and puppet for the saudis like the clinton's ."
how can all these leaders be so anti white and anti christian ?
i mean trudope doesn't even bring in persecuted christians from the me .
he sure loves the muslims and sharia .
science is a pesky irritant when faith seeks to suspend laws of nature .
"of course , apologists will be quick to counter that god can suspend such laws because the universe is god's to do at will , no ?"
"the distinguished physiologist , anton j ."
"carlson , when asked what he thought of the 1950 ex cathedra pronouncement of pius xii that the virgin mary ascended bodily into heaven , is reported to have responded that he couldn't be sure because he wasn't there , but one thing is certain , that she passed out at thirty thousand feet ."
"following that science , jesus and mohammed would have passed out and all who expect to be resurrected and recycled to heaven , no ?"
"apparently , it was the russians that won ."
all people of every race and culture has a territorial instinct and this situation is another example of it .
it shows up mostly in western countries because those are the countries most desirable to live in and are under siege by outsiders .
people in those countries are labeled as racist or xenophobic but being territorial is a common trait to all humans .
"china , for example , doesn't have much of a problem with outsiders because it is such a toxic , corrupt hellhole that most chinese people want to get the heck out of if they had half a chance and enough money ."
see my response to prima below .
sure they didn't and the secessionists papers that make clear their cause don't mean anything either .
over tax and over spend - the liberal way .
the media has been complicit to the ideals of the young hegelians for nearly 3 decades now .
reporting is now nothing more than propaganda to support one of the two political parties .
the media is now less reliable than congress and far less trusted by the american people .
the positive spin is there are new outlets coming along with will eventually replace the dnc coerced propaganda outlets .
on the other hand fox news currently seems like a ship adrift without a specific heading .
part of the problem with main stream media is their attempt to cover 24 hours .
"historically media reported four times per day , morning noon evening and late night ."
there is simply no need to have 24 hour news its like 24 hour weather 20% valid content and 80 % fluff .
"so the gop is even closer to satan than the democratic party that supports abortion on demand , gender on demand and suicide on demand ?"
"exorcists will tell you that abortion , homosexual activity and suicide are the three most reliable indicators of demonic influence or activity ."
"so the moral of the story is that if you want to kill someone , take them tonga and do it there ."
we have cut enough for now charlie .
"and with the budget this young state needs to grow it`s energy infrastructure and spread it`s tax base away from oil , and get out of the boom-bust cycle of oil price swings , we need educated and healthy kids ."
even if there are more cuts to be argued it`s enough at this point .
"it`s time to pay our way like other states in this union with taxes and fees , and a sustainable draw on part of the earnings of the permanent fund while leaving the dividends , and inflation proofing of some kind ."
i don`t want alaska to be under the boot heel of a feckless and dishonest industry claiming to be our partner but needing subsidies that we cannot even audit for effectiveness .
i support this governor`s efforts because it`s a well thought-out plan .
"until a sensible other plan is presented monday , we need to stick with the governor`s plan , which is still written in pencil like he said ."
"but jiminy christmas , let`s get to it ."
judge judy had a black drug dealer in her court who pleaded that he had to sell drug because he was poor .
"she countered that he is not selling drug because he is poor , but that he is poor because he is selling drugs ."
liberals would believe the young drug dealer and weep for how he suffered .
mike harris was upfront about his plans to paper over budget deficits by selling the taxpayer built 407 to private interests was he ?
i must have somehow missed that .
"a yorkie or chihuahua , maybe , and good riddance ."
"if only they got big enough to eat other useless , parasitic ornamental species like sarah jessica parker , melania trump and jessica simpson ."
"sorry , i'm wired that way ."
"they're well-represented , and usually also dangerous rather than just useless ."
"well , killary the blood-countess is dangerous , even more so than trump , but she's dangerous by policy and an hatred-driven need to settle scores , imaginary or otherwise , and the trumpy the kkklown is dangerous via narcissism and incompetency ."
the damage comes from subordinates which slip their leashes through his incompetence .
"pandora , it is not uncommon for ex-catholics , failed seminarians and clergy especially to harbour an unreasonable animosity towards the church ."
"it is a sort of transference of guilt , to blame the institution for one's failure and attack it ."
"when you get a result you don't like in 2017 you have to blame it on climate change or russian hacking , or both ."
"striving for equality is not going to solve any problems , but it will create many ."
and i think on this point you and i are going to have to disagree .
because i seem to remember jesus actively pushing the disciples to spread the good news to gentiles as well as jews .
"he pissed off the pharisees because ( in part ) he broke class , race , and nationality distinctions in order to heal , encourage , and teach equally ."
"he associated with unclean people , including the diseased , including the most despised samaritans , including the oppressive romans ."
and he pushed his disciples to do the same .
"i am very much of the opinion that how we strive for equality is more important than simply engaging in that struggle , and i will even concede that people with the laudable goal of promoting equality have occasionally done so in a detrimental manner ."
"but i cannot agree , even through silence , with the characterization of even those people or their goals as 'satanic' ."
"nice euphemism for adultery , failed marriage ."
replace murder with any other mortal sin and you get marty's point .
the us is in shambles thanks to all the trash the liberals let in .
it isn't right that an 11 year old was left to tend to 4 much younger ones by these parents .
on top of that you are claiming there were numerous safety issues and now most likely no smoke alarms and you still go off and leave your children alone in it .
com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/05/16/i-was-in-total-shock-ohio-police-officer-accidentally-overdoses-after-traffic-stop/ i am as adamant as they come in my defense of pope francis and of the doctrine expressed in amoris laetitia .
nevertheless i am not repulsed by kathryn ann lopez as she tries to defend not being judgemental and excessive polarization with regard to the conflict francis-burke .
if one avoids excessive polarizations one is free discuss the issues .
i have had to restrain myself from calling burke names in my writings in defense of al .
kathryn ann lopez convinces me that the effort to restrain myself was worthwhile .
she is also doing a very worthwhile task as a defender of pope francis in conservative circles .
"comey , and the fbi , were/are building a case ."
they need to collect all the information .
"they don't all anything until they have all the facts , i think ."
"robinson , didn't president obama promise us in 2009 that sea-level rise was going to stop dead as soon as he took office ?"
;- )  the very fact the op's post has been filtered shows that there's posters in here manipulating the civil system to keep dissenters off the record .
"the g&m has replaced their own censors with a small mob of censors , instead ."
obviously the trees are guilty of aiding and abetting and must be taken down .
it's not as if the eu has been a great ally of the us lately .
merkle seemed peeved that the alliance is not solely on europe's terms anymore .
"my goodness , that is quite a fairy tale ."
"here's the ending i would propose: and then they made sure their child was born in canada by saving up a few holidays around the expected time of birth , and then quickly left canada again and lived as expat- canadians until near the end of their days when they ran back to canada to the free health care that they or their child had not paid a penny in taxes towards , and lived the rest of their days , expensively and happily ever after on the dime of taxpaying canadians ."
the indians have become quite uppity since justin became pm .
about 11 million illegals are estimated to be in the us .
about 60 % of these have been there for a decade or more .
clinton got 95 % of the black vote .
looks suspicious to me  actually we didn't .
the texas territory was opened to white and mexican settlers by the mexican government .
they allowed the texans to settle if they converted to the catholic faith .
they started over taxing these settlers and there was a revolt .
the mexican government sent santa anna up to stop it .
"santa anna was defeated and mexico , in the surrender , ceded the lands to the texans ."
they were not invaded or occupied .
learn history and you won't get schooled on these threads .
kinder morgan had a massive spill in 2007 that flowed into a neighborhood in burnaby !
pipelines spill that is a fact .
without 100% certainty how can we allow any pipeline to operate let alone one that is twice as large .
btw kinder morgan was not fined for that massive leak !
"if you had read ( and understood ) it , you would never have made this comment: i don't believe the pope intends to authorize all the politically correct jargon or to suggest each priest just do his own thing ."
"the document is about the legitimate authority of local ordinaries , and thereafter conferences of bishops , to decide on the appropriateness of liturgical translations for their people ."
it restores the original post-vatican ii arrangement that the local decision be submitted to rome for confirmatio .
"not even a hint of authorizing political jargon , or inviting each priest to do his own thing ."
which is why i dared to suggest your comment is off point .
"i suggest to go to action graphics they make these signs , my was for carl and viola two of finest people i knew ."
"plus , surplus signs and damaged signs are sold as scrap ."
"i have a selection of over 100 at my auction yard , if you looking for wall art come on down ."

otoh maybe he doesn't think they did anything wrong either .
maybe he can't remember the sponsorship and other scandals .
what exactly doesn't he get though about campaigning on a promise to end cash for access and then continuing to run cash for access events ?
at best he broke a promise and perhaps deliberately lied to the canadian people .
nobody is so blind as to not see the problem with that .

"headlines on webpages: chaos , anger worldwide as trump ban takes effect , reports the globe and mail ."
"panic , exlaims the headline at australia's main tv news website ."
chaos at us borders says the new zealand counterpart .
"meanwhile , over at rt news , the russian news website , we have this news item: headline: forty percent of refugees in austria put religion above law a new study from the austrian academy of sciences shows that 40 percent of refugees in austria believe religious commands take precedence over the nation’s laws , prompting the country’s foreign minister to push for a rigorous new integration package ."
austria's going to push down hard against muslim religious beliefs in the country in order to address a widespread muslim religious resistance to accepting and abiding by the western rule of law ?
where do i read about that on the website of the cbc ?
lawd this is not the 196ps grandma .
saying the word ass is not a big deal .
if your under the age of 60 i am sorry you have lived such a sheltered life where the word ass offends you .

"first off , china is not a communist country ."
"the day deng xiaoping passed away , john howard , the prime minister of australia was hosting an apec conference in a chinese coastal city ."
"in conversation with the city's foreign affairs director , the question was asked by an foreign guest , what is socialism with chinese characteristics ?"
"he cupped his hands and in a conspiratorial whisper said , capitalism ."
added to that is the fact that china is the country of the future .
prime minister justin trudeau knows that more than most canadians except sinologists who have spent years associating with china and the chinese .
pierre trudeau must have also sensed this .
the usa now under drumpf has an abysmal human rights record .
"so for those in the know , canada's dealings with china is the way of the future ."
"why wait for spring , do it now ."
who would have thought letting 1 million undocumented muslims into germany could lead to this ?
1% of them are terrorists ( and that is low ) that still means there are 1000 of them in germany right now .
the utter stupidity of the left and their kum ba yah attitude to reality is why the right is in an upsurge again .
be prepared for more of the same in the near future and don't be surprised when it comes here as well .
"just to inject a positive note into this chaos , and maybe change the subject a bit , has everyone noticed how utterly successful the trump's travel ban has been ?"
"since its ( only partial , mind you !"

"for the first time in i don't know how long , we can feel safe ( at least from islamic terrorists ) when walking down to the local convenience store ."
"remington i'm all for unbiased journalism and citing sources , but why link to a white supremacist blog ?"
why not just document the source and let people who want to verify that the blog is indeed full of silly writing do so without a direct traffic stream from the wweek site ?
"with targeted advertising the way that it is , now we're more likely to see garbage ads that target the same people who go looking at white supremacist garbage ."
seems like a not good idea .
"another example , for those incapable of analyzing a simple argument , is the question of the skilled trades and other blue-collar sectors ."
ibbotson says that in canada these positions are often filled by immigrants .
"he goes on to say that since these positions are often filled by illegal immigrants in the states and since trump is trying to stem illegal immigration , he can't possibly adopt the canadian system as a model ."
"while there is a problem w individuals buying over the counter service animal vests and claiming their pets are service animals , the airline was clearly in violation of the ada and insensitive and should be penalized and you sir , are an a-hole !"

"let's get more catholics into the usa so we can finally get abortion , birth control , and divorce banned ."
and then we can start burning the protestant heretics at the stake .
it's ironic that the same people who rant about columbus and genocide are in favor of open borders .
both birth control and unworthy reception of holy communion are grave sins .

fundamentalist ways of thinking do not allow for critical insight .
one never uses only one source for information on a topic .
"it was the celebration of the psassover , where jesus instituted a memorial of a new passover , from death to life ."
a return to the aramaic was never intended .
i was referring to the gospel and the original vatican ii mass without the corruptions of the text brought on by a literal translation of the latin .

he was one of those people who gave a lot of himself .
i felt better for reading it .
"very tough , even with a part-time job at the local pizza parlor , but the proliferation of government student loan and grant programs have certainly encouraged college administrators to raise tuition levels at rates far exceeding inflation ."
numbers would be interesting: what percentage of nominal/self-identifying catholics support the death penalty ?
"how does this break down by mass attendance , frequency of confession , generation/age , mode of reception of communion , agreement with other church teachings , preferred form of the mass , liturgical preferences in the ordinary form , frequency of eucharistic adoration or other devotions , familiarity with the catechism , etc ?"
"the linked article is very intelligent , but it's too bad that nobody at the newspapers or other organizations that typically commission polls are asking just what kind of catholics voted against church teachings in nebraska ."
"trump never had a muslim ban , if he had he wouldn't have allowed immigration from any muslim nation and that's not the case ."
your tds is getting the better of you  isn't your pay and benefits public record ?
in any event what do you make a year ?
what make and model of car ?
you should have a look at a new piece written by thomas williams in crisis in which he criticizes the supposed ambiguity of pope francis who says that the security of immigrants is not trumped by national security .
his bottom line is that national security trumps the fundamental human rights of immigrants .
this deserves to be unmasked; mr .
williams couches his argument in unctuous references to aristotle and pius xii .
"i am furthermore in agreement wit kevin57 below , that this piece is inspiring: we need those immigrants because they could be the ones who still hear the words of the gospel as words freshly spoken ."
"most of them are still mired in the challenges of poverty , they still encounter the indifference of the affluent and , so , still look to the heavens for salvation ."
"i am a priest working with mayan mexicans in a rural town in quintana roo , mexico , and i know that feeling which shakes my soul ."
"} new fossil fuel electric generator and pay for the maintenance of a steel on steel wheel train with metal mostly structural , electrical and locomotive parts that are extremely vulnerable to oahu's year round , humid salt air environment ."
a more accurate maintenance cost for the electric powered train is more like $250 million per year .
"with 100% certainty the oahu , rail if ever finished , will be a complete failure and have to be abandoned , similar to the magic steel aloha stadium ."
"clearly , the sting of the lost election has produced an ultramontain reaction ."
what to do when one's agenda for open borders and climate change was foiled by cooperation between evangelical and catholic christians ?
"christians who are more concerned about abortion , illegal immigration and islamic terrorism than faith in socialism ?"
"obviously , you make the silly argument that such cooperation is unjust ."
nato needs to do whatever it takes and eliminate isis at every cost to humanity .
this isis terrorism campaign needs to end and end now .
nobody is safe and haven't been for a long time .
when a member of the local baptist church walks into a pot shop and blows it up along with themself then your statement might have merit .

"nope , nobody gets your illogical thoughts edwin krugman uses 'racist' against those who are wanting tighter immigration enforcement ."
"there are lots of people , and i won't try to quantify , that are protectionist , nativist , xenophobic , legalistic , but not prejudiced specifically by race ."
"krugman stereotyping the target the issue as low skilled latin labor , a specific subset of immigrants ."
it's that subset that he says that brands conservatives to racism ?
( do we hear about european or asian illegals - no ) .
"it's latin immigrant groups that most concerns those who want stricter immigration enforcement , imo ."
if that's the case there is a considerable amount of racism toward latin cultures and it shows up as the 'negative only' stereotypes written by people on this site ( i'm not saying all conservative writers on this site ) .
"immigration policy is large and complex , not a simple declaration of law ."

we should feel responsible to leave the next generation a healthy place to live and reasons for them to feel optimistic about their own future .

there’s a tipping point in these all too common mass murders where the american people say enough is enough .
"they aren’t there yet , sadly ."
"the driving force for gun rights is based on their convoluted understanding of the second amendment , financial considerations of gun manufacturers , and the honest fear that the only way to protect themeselves , is to be armed ."
ironically the only person who could reverse this trend might have been trump .
"most , not all gun owners are his people ."
if trump had personally witnessed gun violence then we may have seen some sanity .
nothing will change in america regarding gun violence .

hawaii is the antithesis to diversity !
"we all look different and we all have odd funny sounding last names ( first names , too , nowadays ) ."
but everyone in hawaii thinks the same !
no one here has an original thought .
no one here is a noteworthy alternative world view advocate .
"everyone in hawaii votes democrat , all the teachers preach leftism in their chapels that are the government schools , everyone in hawaii is for big govt solutions to their ( self-caused ) human problems , everyone in hawaii bought into the sustainable bs ."
"no , madame , hawaii is truly not an example of diversity ."

"yet , surprisingly , he much preferred dief to both lester b ."

my dad felt that way about diefenbaker because his own riding was isolated - way up in northern ontario .

this just in: your account is currently restricted your account is restricted because too many of your comments have been rejected as uncivil .
you can make two comments per 24 hour period i am happy to report this since it confirms that the snowflakes are feeling the heat .
"i think that legislative action might be necessary to allow lottery tickets or funds to be used for housing , homeless shelters+ ."
that is why i wrote to a few legislators last year and called a couple of the organizations that help the homeless .
this could be something to consider for the future if support were drummed up .
i might even start playing the lottery if i knew lottery money would help the homeless .
to imply there was no benefit is an oversimplification .
"sure , some of the package did not work ."
"however 'one year after the stimulus , several independent macroeconomic firms , including moody's and ihs global insight , estimated that the stimulus saved or created 1 ."
8 million jobs and forecast a total impact of 2 .
5 million jobs saved by the time the stimulus is completed .
[81] the congressional budget office considered these estimates conservative .
[81] the cbo estimated according to its model 2 .
"1 million jobs saved in the last quarter of 2009 , boosting the economy by up to 3 ."
5 percent and lowering the unemployment rate by up to 2 .
[82] the cbo projected that the package would have an even greater impact in 2010 .
"[82] the cbo also said , it is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package ."
"and i can tell you locally , that many homes for low income families received energy saving heating , cutting taxpayer costs ."
not sure about all that ms sideco is referring to .
"most of those who were freed to become catholic by vatican ii , can , and by and large did , identify with those who suffered a sense of loss ."
the fact is that those who were set free by and large also experienced a sense of loss .
it is a matter of degree more than qualitative .
"it was a matter of the rightness , the need of the challenge and the willingness to forgo certainty and predictability and absolute and dignity of status and deference to position ."
"as with any adolescent , leaving home is a two-edged sword but leave we must leave the security of conformity to the challenge of quest ."
i really have to question ms sideco's jesuit who bemoaned the challenge of the change .
"the jesuits - most of them - i was associated with ached , prayed for , prepared for the challenge of that change - to some extent - before as well as when it was happening ."
"i would suggest that not only china , but all of n ."

do you have any idea the letter he was replying to ?
how about the history of the government of connecticut at that time ?
"england's parliament passed the religious toleration act in 1689 , & it included a condition that connecticut's laws could not be in conflict with the laws of england ."
"that wall in his letter was talking about the ct general assembly faced with great intolerance from protestants , specifically anglicans ."

") , ct was able to disestablish the congregationalist mandate - and jefferson expressed his satisfaction in a letter to john adams ."

"with regard to congresswoman wilson listening in on the phone conversation , have you thought about how that might have happened ?"
"according to wilson , “when the president called , the phone was placed to her ear and put on speaker ."
"” did myeshia johnson do it on her own or did she do so because someone in the car said “quick , put it on speaker so we can all hear ?"
"” wilson also said johnson’s widow was “balled up” in the car , distraught after learning she would not be able to see her husband in an open casket ."
would a distraught person have the forethought to put the phone on speaker ?

"in a progressive system , top earners should pay a higher percentage of earnings as tax , since they receive more benefit from the country , as other posters here point out ."
"in canada , tope earners do pay a higher percentage , they pay the highest percentage share ."
the people who get the most benefit from a country are those who receive more in services than they themselves are able to pay for .
what has been plaguing the rail project is the continued rise in cost estimate .
defective materials have been successful in infiltrating the rail project: ** http://khon2 .
com/2016/05/05/engineering-experts-raise-quality-concerns-over-honolulus-rail-construction/ - i believe those things happen because hart has been and is prematurely hiring a rail expert to manage construction of the multi-billion-dollar rail project .
"the latest being andrew robbins , a senior director at bombardier transportation ."
premature because construction has not yet been finished .
"- to bring discipline in cost estimates and construction , hart needs to hire a civil engineer with expertise in construction project management ."
a rail expert is needed only when construction has been completed not when trains are not running yet .
- since elrey4 is shocked by this is is probably worth pointing out that both the government grabs i described hurt the poorest the most .

let's be clear the hanford site in washington state was part of a nuclear weapons program after the second world war .
"waste from that facility is stored in tunnels , and one of the tunnels has collapsed ."
"the us government has been cleaning their site for a number of years , and doesn't expect to finish until 2060 at a cost of $100bb ."
"no one has been injured , there has been no release of material mentioned by anyone ."
real journalists would get some detail before mouthing off about unfolding disasters .
free speech is vital to a democracy .

"and white supremacy , marching with clubs and torches , chanting racist slogans; and also the fringe groups on the left that support violence even in opposition to hate ."
"violence isn't free speech , isn't even speech; it's violence ."
it is not protected by the first amendment .

dimples82 asks: why does lil omar get an apology and $10 .
"5 million , while oberlander gets stripped of his citizenship ( again ) ?"
well lil omar as you call him was tortured against canadian and international law with the full knowledge and complicity of his own government which led to his confession and not one but several rulings of our highest courts of law saying that this was a fraudulent torture-obtained confession and thus invalid .
"oberlander is 93 , thus born in 1924 ."
he was a member of a death squad between 1941 and 1943 which means from the ages of 17 to 19 .
certainly an adult by our standards .
and the standards of his era .
khadr was only 15 and by law a child when his incident occurred .
oberlander lied on his application for admission to canada as an adult and the application doubtless included a clause saying false information will invalidate any decision .
everyone know the pro-sharia crowd are the instigators of violence .
is that meant to be taken seriously ?
