your defense of his actions toward these two women is as pathetic as clinton's attempt to avoid the truth about what went on between him and these two women .
"for example , women in combat ."

"for a moment i thought you meant justin trudeau to insist that there are iron clad reasons why women cannot be ordained , stemming all the way back to jesus' intentions for the church , is an attempt to avoid all questions around ordination and the sacraments ."
questions like: did jesus establish a hierarchical church with a system of male orders ?

i just wonder how well those absentee voters ( mostly servicemen&women ) would have known their local candidates when they voted ?

and how does that compare to other explanations including man for extreme change in weather ?

i think what happened is that the trumps campaign created pizzagate in order to retaliate against clinton for all of the women coming forward and saying that trump had raped and molested them .
trump felt that clinton was behind all of these women coming forward at the 11th hour of the campaign to accuse him .

i am sorry but this archaic way of doing things existed to make sure men controlled women in order they had more warriors and workers .

to say i should filter out women in these roles is insane .

the irony--rather hypocrisy--here is that caitk invokes misogyny to defend a woman ( rachael stevenson ) who advocated shooting an unarmed person off a snowmobile with a shotgun .
where we disagree is whether church teaching on women's ordination is misogyny .
shameful considering what bill clinton did to women .

"they are trying to call attention to the black americans--some women , one a child , who was only 12 years old , who are being shot by officers in this country-and not a single one of them has been punished with the slightest amount of jail time ."
hillary would have been a female obama !
i can't see how having this woman come in and speak does anything to advance anyone's cause .
president trumps exposes the same belief as it applies to knowing women in the biblical sense .

women are their own worst enemy .
its a good thing you are around to tell us what visually constitutes what is a sufficiently enough female body .
i guess this “strong” woman didn’t see the need to talk about it while she was getting movie roles .
i wonder how many women actually feel this way or if it is a mouthy minority causing trouble as usual ?
perry should also suggest young women in third world nations and islamic controlled countries be issued a pink 38 caliber pistol .
it will work for oppressed women too .
and i get the argument that the niqab and burqa are potent and regressive symbols of the subjugation of women under islam .

obama cares more about men in dresses serving than fighting isis .

most of them are in their 30's and i think that if you asked them they would proudly call themselves 'feminists' .
you might want to ask the women involved about no one getting hurt it is hard to figure what francis is doing or attempting to accomplish .
"so poor francis walks a fine ecumenical line ( as does welby , who , for example , didn't pair anglian women bishops with catholic bishops in a ceremony a few months back when the pope commissioned pairs of catholic and anglican bishops to work and pray together in their home countries ) ."
you just don't want these women to have any effect .

"how must a perfect man , perfect god worked ?"
i respectfully suggest you spend more time listening to women and less time telling them what to do .
not a single enlightened liberal male that i know of !

", the pregnant women's support act ) ."
she implies that thinking women are leaving but my question is what it says about the who staying .
"of course , if numbers of thinking women are leaving it speaks volumes about those who are staying ."
a corollary of this would suggest that the number of women like ms .

"your wife has two arms , two legs and a heartbeat ?"
"yes , my point is that the rules and standards have been set by the alpha males for centuries and that society's rules are just an extension of the natural world where non-dominant males are marginalized ."
we have now given those non-dominant males a voice via the internet where they can hide in anonymity from the alpha males .
i am no white supremacist and i have married a woman from a different culture and have mixed children .

the author of the book you've referenced is known as a very liberal feminist .
"well , beverly , mom is a vodka chugging , chain-smoking woman who knows she won't get sober ."
the reasons that women have abortions are many .
many women do give up their children for adoption .
one reason behind the 66% rate for women initiating divorce - often they can leave and their ok financially .
it's not clear to me why you believe that a consistent belief that women should have good healthcare represents a conflict of interest .
"manning serves on a voluntary board promoting women's health , which was both a theme of his campaign and a qualification for office ."
therefore the natural law and positive law proscription of homosexual behavior and the divine constitution of the sacrament of orders as pertaining to men only are outside the scope of gaudium et spes .

"currently , a local sears store has had amazing sales and selection in women's clothing ."
so even though he doesn't agree with female ordination to the priesthood he was willing to work with and even have a joint liturgy with anglicans that included female deacons as well as priests .
ultimately i don't expect him to change catholic dogma on women in the priesthood though it does seem changes are likely in the area of the catholic deacon this woman is complaining about the wrong people .
since then clergy and religious who oppose the church’s teaching that women cannot be ordained suffer an excommunication .
"then , jesus really did say call no man 'father' ."
and also billy boy clinton who seemed to like those oral skills of that woman he didn't have sexual relations with .

the nazis and white supremacists show up at these rallies armed and one of them weaponized a vehicle to kill a woman in charlottesville --- an isis tactic .
how this man can live with himself is unbelievable .

my initial comment is satire pointing out the civilian viewpoint about women needing 'special' treatment and the actual fact that military women are successful without the crutches the civilians want to shove under their arms .
trudeau's feminism is as insincere as he is .
i am a woman and can see right through his nauseating pandering .

what will matter is that you upset the white girls and their feelings are more important than evidence can prove .

how many marches will it take to wipe out the regular image of a man degrading his wife .
"a fellow uo professor , who declined to be identified , said the offending professor meant her costume to depict “black man in a white coat: a doctor’s reflections on race and medicine , ” a recent autobiography by dr ."

many woman that are comfortable in their own skin shun feminism and see what it has done to to limit their own gender .
"i'm sure he meant to refer to her surname , yet i know precious few women named darlene who aren't native ."
it is clear she can speak well to all kinds of people women or children and is likely to do better when not campaigning .
a woman has the absolute right to do anything she wants with her body !
"it's not even close , males who go to college will earn far more than those that don't ."
"i , on the other hand , will say that if you want to tell one of the tiny number of women in quebec who actually wear the niqab that she can't wear one , that's much more like telling you that you personally can't wear a cross around your neck than it is like saying that there shouldn't be one hanging over the chief lawmaking body of the freaking province ."

women should be required to get permission before getting pregnant in the military as that directly impacts your ability to do you job .
"additionally , women shouldn't be eligible for the draft ."
women in the military is fine if it is under their own choice .
women making that choice have the right frame of mind for what they are getting into .

a couple of months ago i encountered a woman in a store who was wearing a make american great again ball cap .
i asked her how she could support someone that has admitted to sexually assaulting women .
her response was that she would be proud to have trump grab her---he only grabs beautiful women .
"how do we display ourselves , how do we present ourselves as women , what are we asking ?"
"you look at everything all over the world today , you know , and how women are dressing and , you know , what they're asking by just presenting themselves the way they do ."
the person who said this was a woman and she was telling the absolute truth but then forced to recant under pressure from the fake msm .

on the contrary the holy ghost will ensure that the church does not fall into the error of believing that women can be ordained .
there are as many english grannies stopped at airports as young middle eastern/muslim men .
monty as the supervisor is responsible for this man losing his life .
the speech i am referring to had nothing to do with those women .
just because you haven't seen a woman breastfeeding doesn't mean you haven't .
does the female breast send you into uncontrollable desire like the previous poster claimed it did to him ?
"soooo , a 31 year old 200+ pound polynesian walks over to a 72 year old man's car and punches him and the older man shoots the assailant ."
trump will continue to smear poo on america's face and this dirty woman-hating country deserves it .
"man fires into air , man fires into mulch , man loses gun on trail , firing off deck these are all drunk idiots , not actively resisting arrest , and surrendering , your narrative is losing ground ."

"the man came to the parish with his cassock , biretta and a sense of mission -- to undo what was in place , to do it quickly , without attending to the culture or history of the parish , and without listening to anyone ."
i think that does not bode well for the man or for the parish .
"fact is a fallible , mortal man can only know small bits of truth ."
there is a measurable insinuation of guilt when a defendant is wearing an orange suit chained to 4 other guilty men .
i'm pro law and order; however a man deserves the dignity of representing himself as a gentleman in our courts .
"for every girl who cries rape or abuse , there are ten more who became successful in the industry ."
you have to put yourself into the head of this man .
"we all do hear through our own filters , however , and he may have an automatic , instantaneous resentment against any kind of female authority/intelligence/power -- which hillary exudes even eating pizza ."
"isn't this the same woman who said allowing women to carry pepper spray to repel attackers was sexist , as it put the onus of defense on the woman , and not spreading warm and fuzzy feelings ?"
"and now , somehow , failing to provide on-demand abortions on par with punching a woman in the face ?"
"no worries , trumps russian womanizing & american woman degradation will take him down faster than anything else ."
in many countries gay men have been murdered with police turning a blind eye .
i certainly wouldn't want people who support violence against women or children immigrating to our country .
i do not know any woman that has gotten an abortion due to rape/incest or for medical reasons .

"on obama's watch there have been over 700 , 000 slaughtered and almost 2 million refugees most of which are young illiterate muslim men have migrated to western europe with a destabilizing effect as they have no intention of assimilating ."

trump needs to put on his big boy pants and break his twitter rants and start taking the office of president seriously .
"if hell has no fury like a woman scorned , there is no falsehood that liberals are unwilling to invent and spread about any black who dares to not be compliant with them ."
so you're saying that all the women voting for trump are choosing party over women ?
"makes you wonder just how confused this young man is  i lived in the bush for many years , and participated in or benefited from hunting ."

"remember this: the temptation to throw bread crusts at a starving man is frought with peril , for once you give a hungry man free food , he will become dependent upon you ."
"a native in wainwright once told me we lived here without the white man for thousands of years , when the white man's money is gone we will still be living here it is the natives that are complaining that government does not do enough , not me ."
possibly one of the reasons there is a priest shortage is that young men do not want to become priests because they do not want to join a 'brotherhood' that is disgracefully chauvinistic .

i wonder what these women and the millions like them would make of opposition to bill 62 ?
your source states that the possible negative effects of pregnancies on the health of women are not important because they are not life-threatening .
"medical reasons for having an abortion do affect a woman's longevity sooner , after she gives birth , or later , a few years later due to damage suffered during the pregnancies ."
privileged women have obvious and legitimate self-interest in trying to ensure women's control over their own fertility .
the sole reason for not ordaining women is misogyny .

more incongruencies evident from these female protests marches .
"trumps campaign manager was a very bright female , the only one to lead and win the presidency in us history ."

"the game consists of women wearing garments that draw attention to , expose , and enhance their breasts ."
"other fashions sold not only by victoria's secret but by just about every major and minor women's clothing store , do very similar things ."

there are something like 18 women who came forward to accuse trump of sexual harassment or sexual assault .
who is the man of character ?
you agree that they used the argument of the inferiority of women .

do you follow sharia law which calls for the killing of gays and the stoning women who have sex out of marriage ?
"canada: 2013 , 1 out of 17 women raped ."
it's the ultimate insult to claim you are helping women by performing a procedure that kills her child .

maybe you can do a report on how many women make up the techy sweatshops in china run by foxconn / apple ?
"or , the call centers in india is that not women in 'tech' ?"
the picture of these three women hiding behind black garments and playing with a child disurbs me greatly .
this poor child is growing up missing the sight of happy smiles these poor women have it all wrong  and a man named trump cried out unto the masses gathered therein; i alone know all things and i alone will shall save you .
a poste elsewhere says it's about womens rights but i agree with you that it's being sold on the tenuous grounds of security .

i am beginning to find the media obsessin with this man disturbing .
"i bet bob is totally celebate , as all men should be , unless specifically creating a baby that they will be responsible for ."

"and some muslim countries , like azerbaijan , egypt , tunisia and turkey , don't allow women to wear niqabs to cover their faces ."
and saudi arabia doesn't let muslim women wear niqabs to cover their faces while on the haj in mecca .
maybe the courts in canada should finally make a decision whether the religion of islam really requires muslim women to cover their faces .

"we would be treated fairly by spring , but its men ."
just so i am real clear on this gerry because i get confused real easily so what you are saying is that a small group of men all gop ( because they are the one's in power ) have raised the cost of healthcare to all of us somehow or because due to the high cost of healthcare they are using the er's for minor partfy decissions and they are the ones who cry the loudest when things don't don their way .

one reason so many white men got together with each other is that how vilified we have been for the last few years from the left and the media .
"and seperatly , they have also been attacking men as well ."
"apparently , sexism is acceptable today , so long as it's against men ."
the question of climate change as it relates to man made activities is very complex and is vexing the most scientific of minds .

this isn't the first time that wente has used the privileged position of a column in a national newspaper to personally attack a young woman in a position of far less power .

no joe what what firewalled my power levers was the council woman's statement that an additional 35 ae-18e aircraft will draw the attention of terrorist with her dramatic perdition of another pearl harbor in the making .

i expect any day now gender equity consultants will start pressing for more women in dangerous lines of work so we can address the dramatic gender disparity in workplace injuries and death [crickets chirping] there have been many convicted criminals on death row that have been exonerated with dna and other evidence that shows they have been wrongly convicted in the first place .

we would be shining spotlights on these issues if missing and murdered women and these suicides were all cute little blondes .
"depends would the cute little blondes be choosing to live on incredibly remote ( at gta person has no idea ) lakes , that have to have everything flown in ?"
"perhaps these cute little blondes might either be so cut off from their family to such an extent that when she goes missing at 15 , it is only noticed after 6 weeks when an aunt calls it in ( the two cases of disappearance this paper covered a year of so ago in winnipeg , stated exactly that - aunts calling it in weeks after anyone noticed the girls gone ) ."
what credibility do these men have ?
hillary was in charge of what she herself termed bimbo eruptions and the political plan was to scorch earth any and all women would came out exposing just how extensive bill's philandering is .
i haven't been convinced that man is the reason .
i haven't been convinced that altering economic systems accomplishes a reduction in the unproven theory that man is the cause .

"of course not , but more of it is happening against white males than the professional victim sjws would like to acknowledge ."
but theology of the body---does spend too much time focusing on women's bodies .
women believe that they cannot flourish in the church until they are first and fundamentally perceived as baptized persons [gifted with a sacramental spirituality] and---not just as wives and mommies .
o'rielly's sexual predation is documented by the ( at last count ) five settlements he's reached with those women he's sexually harassed .

"god gave a woman the most incredible role in history , to give birth to and nurture jesus christ , his son and universal king ."
the church gives women a mop and bucket and a tin of brasso .
inquiry into missing and murdered women a failure: indigenous group no surprize here knew it would be a total failure the second it was announced .
the extremists are the right wing who actively work to remove the rights of women .
"furthermore , she acknowledges the need for a female leader in the movement and she is saying that a female can be given a chance but not as a president now because we do not have a female deputy and tradition stipulates that a deputy must lead when the current president steps down ."

he didn't say the man was not armed .
"he said if the man was not armed , then shouldn't we indict him ."
do you have any evidence that the man was armed ?
in my opinion the fact that all of the scj judges are white and now male is evidence to support the claim that we need more diversity in our leadership roles .
( and pay for the child if that is the end result )  i dare you to follow a lady getting a late term abortion to all her doctors appointments .
this woman seems intent on doubling down on her desire to prove that she is an idiot .
"we are not limiting god by not ordaining women , we are recognizing the limits that god has placed on the authority of the church ."
the ordination of women is outside the purview of the authority that god has granted to the church .
saying that the church by not ordaining women is placing limits on god is like saying that because 2+2=5 mathematicians are placing limits on god .
you call obama the infusion of gender fluid men .
look for talented women with the competency to serve .
there are too many examples of incompetent women gaining leadership roles: just look at the bc and ontario premiers .
i doubt there’s a non-sexist way to explain why it’s only women who hide their faces .
"festivals at night , men dress in masks , drink , get rowdy , pinch the frauleins speculating -- in former times , was festival a time of impregnations which increased variability in the gene pool and improved survivability of remote communities ?"
women so impregnated in festival were killed ?

no difference in the kesey career   gori ( white girl ) .
i am sure this phrase is always used with the utmost of respect  it is a mask these women are wearing .
and to think that these females are our leaders in government ?
"to the good ole days when women stayed in the kitchen , people of color and immigrants knew their place , and kowtowed to authority , and every word from elected leaders was accepted as the gospel truth ."
"anyway , genesis 1:26 says: then god said , “let us make man in our image , after our likeness ."

how can you ignore what hillary has done to women who were actual victims of the violence you talk about ?
hillary has repeatedly maliciously maligned and smeared women who have had the courage to come forward and report the numerous instances of aggressive molestation and even rape committed by her husband bill clinton .
"hillary meanwhile spent a tremendous amount of energy and effort , over the years , literally destroying those women who dared to come forward and speak of their ordeals ."
the missing & murdered women's inquiry just keeps resetting because they have no goal .
jackie robinson was a great man and deserves this eulog my donors ?
how about the $41 million for viagra for service men ?

"they shamefully cast doubt on the veracity of the accusers — 4 unconnected women who , with nothing to gain , spoke up against an abuser in a thoroughly researched and reported story that relied on more than 30 sources ."

i suspect this driver didn't even see the woman .
she has threatened and intimidated women who were raped by bill to keep their mouths shut .
"ok , a lady who lost to pretty much a neophyte in obama , was one of the worst sos's ever who managed to have all of the money in the world on her side and a sitting president who was pretty popular just handing her the baton and she lost to trump , all while blaming white women , russians , comey , the dnc , bernie , wikileaks and sexism etc ."

"trudeau's thoughtless and naive feminist international assistance policy , that was shoved down the throats of the already confused federal employees , who are scrambling to implement it without any new resources , by simply rebranding harper's international assistance and development programs while they happen is a national embarassment with global implications ."
"how sad for both women , both the killer and victim ."
despite all the political yammering by democrats gorsuch is the best man for the job .
this man should be arrested for hate speech .
there are no accusations that sajjan is not a brave man .
too bad about the woman though .
women should have the right to terminate their pregnancy .
"#anchorage police believe his girlfriend , bonnie degenstein , 27 , shot him once in the forehead after finding out he was dating other women ."

"the fight to bring the church into some relationship with democracy , with educated and adult laity , with empowered women , and with lgbtqi people is not going to end because they can't face reality ."

"let me tell you: being a bodybuilder and having all those sexaully over heated and thuggish women grabbed my biceps and giggled , or rubbed my chest like it was public property was humiliating , i wept from the humiliation i had to endure when they stared at me like i was a slab of meat ."
so how can a woman who is too drunk to speak possibly consent to sex ?
to deny women the right to kill their babies in utero is hardly treating them like cattle .

i'm just not an ignoramus like so many other white men .
pay no attention to that man behind the curtain .
he surrounds himself with third-rate yes-men and third-rate family members .
the woman doesnt know how lucky she is .
did not know her but from the article i get a sense that she a young woman full of life who reached out to help others .
"right , but what does he know of being a woman anywhere ?"
#fakenew just wondering if it has occurred to anyone else that the woman spearheading changes to our country's democratic reform is an illegal alien .
boyle probably learned well from zaynab khadr how women should be treated .
first of all it was white guys who gave her the right to speak as she is .
"and although it was white guys who purchased africans from fellow africans for the purpose of slavery , it was white guys who died by the thousands to give the slaves freedom ."
"her comment of white guys taking up room belonging to someone else is quite ironic , as i'm sure somewhere along the line she benefitted from affirmative action ( taking the place belonging to someone else ) , a law passed by white guys ."
"i agree when she said thing should be equal , thus she should be treated as her targets ( white men ) would be ."
butt lite is what little women drink .
"what we need to do is offer more substantive assistance to these women to help them  when i first entered the business world , an advertising agency in london , in the mid-fifties i could write a letter - or more precisely dictate a letter to be typed by a secretary from shorthand - in the morning which would be posted and delivered elsewhere in london by the afternoon of the same day ."

the man should have just kept his dignity and went to the private sector or k street like other gop consultants with an ounce of self-respect did in june .
yeppers that would be the donor's who kill gays and commit atrocities against women that most people have no clue what is going on every minute of every day .
yet other forms of violence against women are far more prevalent than honor killings .
the incidence of domestic violence against women by native-born americans is regularly downplayed .
she certainly is a great business woman .
this should have been called: a day without a liberal woman .
"and someone who enjoys hunting does not do it for fun , but that does not men they don't enjoy it ."

"“but i believe strongly in the right of a woman to choose , i believe strongly in the right of same-sex people to marry ."
you're giving an out to any man who decides he doesn't want to support a child he's recently fathered .
"you talk about entrapment of boys and men for personal gain , but provide no evidence that such a thing is commonplace or needs legislative remedy meanwhile , what about the welfare of the child itself ?"
"hansen , are you suggesting that the door to pastoring for women might close ?"
women pastors in adventism are some of the best preachers and shepherds in the denomination .
you would punish not just the woman but the child by denying them access to pre- and post-natal care as well as to the other necessities of life .
"however , i dare you to live one day as a woman ."
so how come it's only happening to women who get the virus while pregnant ?
this man well deserves to be harshly condemned by society .
and that black man seriously made a fool of trump at the white house correspondents white tie dinner by ridiculing him for being the father of birtherism .
who gives a s___t - let the women protest !
"shenna , you are an amazing woman !"
i am also wondering where the same program is for men .
our society does not stress enough the importance of fathers in the lives of their children .
"time for a little education mr racist 1 ) the economy of this country is white; this group of mainly afrikaner men control almost all the levers of our economy what utter bull manure sa's 16 top richest people : 3 are afrikaners , 2 are black 1 is italian , 8 are jewish and 2 are english south africans ."
that woman is perfectly able to talk about her husband .
"how do you know she is not gay , and she is the female half ?"
she is a post-grad grown woman who gets so drunk she passes out and has total memory loss .
"this guy was drunk too , and he went too far ( or at least went on too long ) ."
how much longer can our country allow a batsh*t crazy man make decisions that destroy what has made our country great .
this woman is the same embarrassment to hawai'i that trump is to the united states .
"“prime minister trudeau , it is time for you to come alongside families of [missing and murdered women , girls and two-spirited people] , restart this inquiry and create space for an indigenous , trauma-informed process that honours all our relations ."
apparently he was attempting to get revenge for getting whupped by a girl in the last debate .
the man is either clueless or coming completely unhinged or both .
i think i recall there were numerous times when women threw me down on their beds and jumped on top of me .
there is no other reason not a single woman has been prime minister .
and they obviously don't think women can win .
"of the 40 plus presidential candidates , after women got the right to vote , 1 has been female and that too because her husband was an ex-president ."
"when i said for those white males , educated or no , do their votes not count ?"
i could care a less if the good doctor is a woman or not as long as they can act and wouldn't have commented as i don't know any fans of the doctor who care either but tabitha completely lost me with the whole rant on political correctness .
"it's a cop out to say that the people who are against it really just want to beat up on blacks , women and gays with impunity ."
hardly a word about the huge insult & lack of respect shown toward this poor woman who seems to have been totally unable to defend herself .
"if the law really does state that a woman this drunk is capable of consent , then , as somebody famous once said - the law's an ass !"
abortion is healthcare and a legal right already and the day we women have to give up our rights you christians will be giving up your right to gather to worship in peace .
i am not interested in your opinion about my rights or any of your other frankly retarded views about women and gender .
"but there is immediate money for international posturing , feminist foreign policy , gender equality g7 , etc ."
"the female bears the ultimate responsibility of having the child , but she may not have responsibility for whether or not she gets pregnant ."
you must feel empowered to be a female lapdog .
"they still ignore issues of female bodily integrity , which utterly defeat their views ."
"women and gender studies , maybe ?"
but to the point of depleting a resource and then blaming it on the white man's technology ?
no woman will ever love you as much as your mother .
they come in third in a three man race and say they're a winner because they didn't ask anyone to vote for them .
” you seem to be saying that that women are entitled to enjoy their sexuality over the bodies of the unborn .
"the mail online , march 14 , 2017 the man's is a cretin of the highest order ."
i am reminded by those days when a women and a girl could not use the same bathroom because the girls might be exposed to women having a period and little girls should not know about those things .
"at this point , the busters don't give a rat's patoody about anything but themselves ie that woman in the picture with the button that picture screams look at me , look how pure i am ."
prince kuhio was a great man that worked tirelessly for the hawaiians .
"you also realize that if any man had written the same you would be declared a misogynist , rapists , etc ."
"despite the standard issue defenses and outright lies spouted by some in a desperate attempt to canonize this man because they agree with his stance on doctrine , he participated in the protection of clergy who raped children ."
trudeau sure is a powerful women he is what peterson calls a sneaky beta : https://youtu .
"be/a7hez7iyaho kathy griffin is a crass nasty woman with no respect for the office of the president , she has no understanding of comedy and should be ashamed of herself ."
my sister was assaulted at 14 because she was on the bus .
most girls know that they are vulnerable .
one in 4 girls is sexually assaulted by the time they reach 25 .
"that happens not because they are drunk , not because of how they were dressed but because they were girls and in the world ."
the over riding concern is how society values girls/women and their bodies .
"yes , feminism does affect all of society ."
feminists continue to push for erosion of basic due process where crimes against women are concerned and lobby against punishments for the many women who make false accusations .
women's groups continue to push for board quotas to focus on gender rather than qualifications - a potential disaster in the making that degrades the achievements of women who really focus on their careers .
"i don't see a problem with the cub scouts accepting girls , but i see many problems with the boy scouts accepting girls ."
talk about opening the door to a slew of lawsuits every time one of those boys ( with their raging hormones ) does something stupid .
i would never want to be a scout master trying figure out how to include girls on a scouting trip to one of those camps that has barracks-style bedding talk about a pandora's box bad idea .
actual reconciliation would end the lucrative white man guilt industry and that will never happen .
"man , these white supremacists are such fragile snowflakes ."

"i had to laugh to see on tv some sovereignty advocate , a white man , dressed in a costume suggesting he was a hold man ."
some whites are desperate to be accepted as mystic men with indigenous connections .
",  in 1989 marc lepine shot and killed 14 women and wounded many others ."
this crime was labelled a hate crime as the reason given was his hatred toward women .
"by the same twisted folks who contort themselves mindlessly defending a 6th century religion that throws gays off buildings , stones women , believes in honor killings , and forces women to cover themselves ."
i can see downtown eugene now with all the scantily clad women sitting in their windows along willamette street just like you were in amsterdam !
much funnier than the many other trendier females doyle has heaped oodles of overbearing praise on in his column .
"you have my vot if the superintendent was a man , he probably would have resigned by now ."
he reminds me of the man that is so frustrated with his ineptitude and weakness in himself that he goes home and kicks the dog .
it is a tragedy that women who suffer this abuse are not offered help .
"instead of wasting money on people who want to live on the streets , have done so for years and enjoy the street life , help women who need temporary safe space ."
this woman simply needs a hand up .
"yet , the dems pretend they care about children , women , and minorities ?"
there are women and minorities killed in abortion as well .
what a good christian man who follows every precept like 'do unto others'; except for his misinterpretation where he forgets the second part of the phrase .
do you think it's melania's achieving the american dream that you like better- or her being a successful and strong woman without leftists like hillary telling her she is ?

to implicitly draw attention to women associated with a difficult situation that occurred under the watch of the senior managers as a means of deflecting some or all of the blame for the situation occurring .
this woman has more strength and integrity than president trump .
"mattis needs to understand that the man who appointed him , and who he will call his commander and chief , is a bought and paid for tool of putin and the new soviet union ."
seminarians would be exposed to the real he men who work on cars and attend sporting events .
this would ensure no fragile men become priests .
"where were you when trump was getting billions of dollars if free media exposure demeaning mexicans , blacks , immigrants , women , democrats , gays and anyone who dared to disagree and/or say anything against him ?"
"kudos to ken frasier , a man who stands up for his beliefs ."
the man is a buffoon and a disgrace to the office .
"thank you , rob , for making clear why , unfortunately , women will have to continue to demonstrate ."
don't think the man has ever had an original idea in his life .
trudeau better understands that veiled women are not well accepted .
i can’t believe white ­college-educated women voting for trump in florida .
now seriously how stupid do you opponents sound when the woman who kicked them out wants them to return ?
her choice in how to respond to the media's attempted assassination tells us volumes and volumes about the woman hillary clinton .
"they want a bunch if islamist tyranny states that execute gays , conduct genocide on other religions and stone women , to help their claims of maltreatment in canada ."
alienating male supporters who would otherwise be inclined to donate to the aclu and planned parenthood if you would be disourged from donating to such important causes because you weren't invited to a movie then you're not really a supporter .

"it should be the responsibility of the country these women live in and in many of these places abortion is illegal , so liberals are funding illegal activities ."
"as to the rest of it on how we have been handling everything well without supports for women , why no , that is historically inaccurate ."
two years for firing a nail gun at a woman's head .
"on twitter , women were tripping over themselves to support her and thank her for empowering them ."
now she thinks not adopting her beliefs about feminism and a politician makes you the equivalent of a mass murderer .
"hunt obviously didn't shoot the woman on may 12 , did you mean the not recording part ?"
there were virtually no arrests anywhere during the women's march on saturday .
"funny that saudi arabia has realized that women are entities who should be liberated to drive , but canadian liberals think that it's progressive to cover women up , hide their distinctiveness , and make them into non-entities ."
the only thing i disagree with you on is the idea that the hf did irreparable damage to the church and to women .
"women , people of color , lgbtq , immigrants ( documented or not ) , the non-religious/non christian , the physically impaired , those with chronic illness , those who like to breath clean air and drink clean water , the environment , science , wildlife , and our planet earth all know that trump is by far the worst of two evils ."
"the male passenger needs to arrested , jailed and banned from flying forever ."
you would want your wife or daughter to be talked dirty sexual comments and propositioned each day while working .

i doubt it a 45 year old man poses as a cop to intimidate a teen age girl ?
"if there is a group of women anywhere that should be discouraged from child bearing , it is the globe's columnists ."
"since god created everything in 6 days , and man was created the same day as other land animals ( assuming that the large dinosaurs we find in the fossil record are not the result of some kind of cross breeding--and we can't know that for sure ) , it is hard to argue against their having lived at the same time ."
"furthermore , since most of the dinosaur fossils were rapidly buried in the flood , it is an inescapable conclusion that man and dinosaurs existed together , regardless of whether or not they were created or hybridized ."
"at the point it's about winning and your vendetta , not about rape or poor 'defenseless' women ."
"an other religion , islam , is far more oppressive against women and gays including honor killings and executing young gay teenagers , but strangely this group would never protest it , so the protesters grasp of reality is non-existent as is their credibility ."
"the man's prayer: i'm a man , but i can change , if i have to , i guess ."
he is a caricature of the caricature of the jesuit priest: a man who scorns and despises the truly marginalized and flatters and cultivates the rich and influential .
( the idea that same-sex attracted men are persecuted in the catholic church is beyond ridiculous .
exactly the sort of man who makes the catholic priesthood ridiculous and impotent .
"in the days when few colleges even imagined a woman as their leader , there was one corner of academe where women ruled: roman catholic colleges ."
"until the late 20th century , a catholic college president was more likely than not to lead a women's college , and to do so in wimple and veil rather than suit and tie ."
"but as women have risen to the top job at more colleges overall , they’ve lost ground in catholic higher education , their ranks dwindling as colleges went coed and lay leaders replaced nuns ."
the number of women in the presidency at catholic colleges is now at an all-time low .
com/news/2012/06/22/catholic-colleges-worry-number-female-presidents-falls this was from just 4 years ago: yet this story says that the number of catholic women presidents has skyrocketed in the past 16 years .

concerning the woman issue ; no woman worker harder to destroy other women than hillary clinton .
what i do blame her for is her attacking each and every woman who complained about what bill had done to them .
what she did trying to destroy the lives of all of bill's victims---then proclaim her self as a woman supporting all woman is her biggest lie of all .

and then there is hillary the pillar of virtue who savaged all the dozen or more women who could prove they were sexual partners of her way-ward husband .

being a white male between 18 - 40 without a handicap puts me at the bottom of the resume pile .

'cause they weren't going to vote for you just 'because you are a woman' .

"there are , whether we like it or not , some women who seek sex with famous individuals politicians , entertainers , athletes , etc they're often termed star f$%#$ers ."
it's not an insult to all women to acknowledge that such persons exist they do simple fact .

"trump's behavior , as chronicled in his famous boasting , and as alleged in the cases of the ten or so women who have come forward , is very different ."

"i hear what you're saying , but to be clear , a woman doesn't' have a right to an abortion ."
"since women can currently be denied abortion in the latter portions of pregnancy , it must necessarily be true that she doesn't have some inalienable right to abortion ."

i would like to say that i read this man little bit and get information about this matter through this article .

i think that some women become hooked on meth because of an attempt to lose weight when body shaming jerks with a beer belly cannot control the urge to judge women .
having actually dealt with this man in the past i can definitely say if he was lonely it's because everyone avoided him for their own safety .

"well , i always wondered whose idea it was to have all those fox women journalists ( except megan kelly ) sit around with their 8 inch heels , skirts up to their tush and faces frozen with a pancake makeup smile ."

and i bet you admire his open misogyny and disgusting behavior toward the women who accused him of sexual assault ?
"obviously you admire his style of sexual assault , since you have so far avoided even acknowledging that it even exists , despite the fact that he admitted it in a live mic recording , and has also spoken openly about his sexual deviancy for decades on howard stern and other shows , and any other place he can find a willing camera ."

george faust - they were thinking helping this man would cut into their busy day and that he might sue them if there was a possibility that they didn't do something just right to help him .
the less charitable view of this is that the man was a public inebriate and they would just as soon he die so they don't ever have to deal with him .
"you can lead a horse to water let's talk about pakistan , and the woman currently facing the death penalty for the crime of drinking from the muslim-only water pot and blaspheming ( of course her word is meaningless compared to that of her accusers ) , or should we talk about the poor girl who was burned alive by her mother and brother last week for eloping without their blessing ."

an ilk is a female elk .
why do they give this woman the space and ink in this paper ?
bill's wife is running - and she was very involved in running a smear campaign against any poor woman who came forward against her husband's sexual aggression .
what irritates me even more is the prolife movement is immune to the fact that there are women and their baby daddies out in the land who should never have children and yet they don't want to deal with the social issues which would help create fewer ricky grays .

i really don't get why this article is trashing on the gates foundation for providing women with contraceptives .
"apparently , african women want to plan their pregnancies just like american women ."
most women don't want to be constantly pregnant because it isn't pleasant .

whatever happened to keeping the government out of women's bodies ?
let me get this straight: a woman's choice to kill her unborn child is between her and her doctor .
a woman's choice to try something experimental needs to be mediated by government regulation because she and her doctor might make a choice that puts her life in danger ?
"if a woman and her doctor determine it is worth the risk , why is that any of the governments' business any more than liberals claim abortion is ?"

"i would like to see more females in these positions , but affirmative action is not the solution ."
a better solution would be to find out why more women are not applying and finding ways to encourage more to apply so if you have more women applying things should move towards a more equal outcome .

hee's public display of his obsession with another man's genitals during a senate confirmation hearings was a perversion of the committee's inquiries into a candidate's qualifications .

"so if a country decides to deprive its women the right to vote , it should not be labelled sexist ."
"this happening now; women , particularly poorer women , and in poorer parts of the world , are used as rent-a-wombs so that richer people can have the babies they consider their right ."
wente knee jerk reaction to anything feminist is most often misleading .

women have the 'capacity' to be priests but that is distinct from the official line which is that the church does not have the authority to validly confer ordination on women .
yes - like finally ordaining women priests .
i a not against married priests of both genders once we have been ordaining celibate women to the same exact sacrament and holy orders first .
"this is because with the likely excess of priests that would come with adding both women and married clergy , more priests could share ministries in parishes and in orders while offering diversity in the style of leadership ."
"that being said , i believe married priests should be added to the priesthood but not replace celibate male and female priests ."

"then move to europe for the next 20 years , and find out what how easy it is to turn a relatively safe progressive secular society where women have equal rights and power to me , where gays aren't murdered as they leave gay bars , into something that resembles the hellholes of the middle east , in about 1 generation of uncontrolled migration , reproduction , and unwillingness of a host culture to stand up for the values that made it successful ."
"geez , can't these women just understand that a friendly pat on the rear means no harm; a comment about their breasts is just a compliment; an invitation to engage in sexual relations is just a joke; a little unsolicited neck rub for the secretary is just harmless endearment; and that telling ribald jokes and stories is just socially accepting them as equals gosh what's the matter with these broads today gary crum i would like to see our next president convene a national convention of only women from both side of the question to figure out what to do about the abortion issue ."
it should be convened every year until the women of our country decide what they want to do about abortion .
it reported that it unanimously agreed that found no biblical or sister white prohibition for ordaining women to the ministry of the seventh-day adventist church .

"what rachael harder does not believe in , are the rights of women to have reproductive autonomy in canada ."
"as of today , this is a fact of canadian law and legislation; women have this right ."
rachael harder does not believe that women should have this right in canada .
"therefore , she is not equipped to hold a position as the chair of a committee on the status of women as she does not believe that the rights that women have in this country should be upheld ."
"i guess it was when hrc began harassing women , when she herself was quite young , with sexual innuendo and then actual physical imposition ."
"and why she supports women's rights , just so she can be close to them and put her hands on them ."
new scholarship offers hope to women who want to be ordained ?

screening based on family history will miss the 75% of women who develop breast cancer each year who have no family history .

augustine and gregory amalgamated her with the repentant woman because the need for penance was felt deeply .

girls are so icki regarding these abuse comments .
"please note that the usccb just issued another annual report and the data showed that more than 80% of the abuse cases are male priests , and male victims , that is to say same sex abusers ."
and 90% of the cases are with post-pubescent boys .
a woman claims to have been raped .
a soho woman claims to have been raped .
"an immigrant woman , a mute woman , a student  obviously this is a must win situation for the wahine ."
mahalo to our ladies all put on their best for the entire challenge and prevailed .
"after all , these things would never happen with a tough , real man , like trump in the wh , it only happened because president obama was president remember ?"
on the other hand ‘the vast majority of canadian muslim women do not wear a veil’ .
"do the authors of the editorial realize that the conclusion of these statements is that the vast majority of canadian muslim women are not practicing their religion ( in the editorial’s view ) , because they don’t wear a burqa ?"
great honor for a very humble man .
this should be way beyond the stand by your man stubborn mentality that persists on the part of his base .
what's next women in wheel chairs to make your argument ?
just make up girl's names like rachel for this right and lavona for his left .
i would assume that in keeping with the government's stated desire of gender parity that they will be hiring 50% male researchers and activists as a requirement of getting the money .

"women don't have to become pregnant at every opportunity , until they die or become barren ."
"i know because it's on the internet and you're a man , or not ."

"leah , this article is a waste of a read so there must be a woman's march somewhere that you can take your four year old to ."
the woman is more delerious than i ever thought .
"i would ask all of you to say oh , it's just typical men's behavior !"
"to ask yourselves: if that's typical men's behavior towards your daughters , wives , and mothers , are you still ok with that ?"
it is perfectly irrelevant that a man is attracted sexually to this or that category of people when that man is a priest .
this is not a man to look up to regardless of your political beliefs .
"such a strong , smart woman who , through her recent health issues , has managed to still be an important and vital voice for hawaii and the us ."
"well , as a guy who now dates guys , i can attest that most men are after one thing , so yeah , i agree with you on that most guys just want something casual ."
"oh , man do we ever suck !"
"that too reese being a priest and a man missed both points ,  so you will buy goods made by fascist one party states like china or terrorist places like iran over the usa ?"
"thats pretty pathetic , the usa is among the most free place for all races and woman pal , iran and china not so much right !"
"and those people who would rather have women pastors , can have them ."
all they have to do is join a protestant church that has a women pastor .
"for example , i don't believe we should decentralize ordination practices , including whether we are ordaining women priests and/or married priests ."
yes we have laws in this country that protects women from dirty old men who can't stop themselves from putting their hands on women's privates without consent .
"another woman , of colour , to parade around in full view for the country to say look at me , look at my candidates and mps ."
or a group protest how white males have been treated in the country ?
"hail mary , full of grace , the lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb , jesus ."
"amen if you can't see the hypocricy of a multi-millionaire black man disrespecting the flag instead of actually doing something constructive--like getting black gang bangers to quit killing other black people back in the neighborhood he came from , there is no point in trying to say more ."
do no lump people with mental illness in with that woman's choices .
the world looks to canada's prime minister as being a good man and yet these haters scream at the world because they hate justin trudeau .
are they forgetting that trump's entire campaign showed no respect for anybody or their family members or for women .
"most modern first ladies have been politically oriented and have campaigned for their husbands , so they are in the limelight , but they almost seem to get smeared more than their husbands ."
and michelle obama was attacked because she allegedly didn't look feminine enough for some people's tastes .
"melania trump is the least political first lady we've had in decades , but she was attacked for the remarkably common sense , imo , choice to remain in new york city so that melania's and donald's son barron could finish out his school year before transferring to a washington dc private school , and she is attacked for being beautiful ."
"this commission is not tasked , as i understand it , with deciding if the female diaconate should be reestablished in some form ( in which case , a lack of deacons on the commission would be a serious misstep ) , but with the deeper question of whether the historical female diaconate represents women in major orderss ( versus minor orders ) ( to use the latin terms ) or cheirotonia ( versus cheirothesia ) to use the byzantine equivalent ."
"in my opinion ( as a retired byzantine deacon ) , the fact women were ordained behind the iconostasis and with an epiclesis the same as male deacons  now the palm beach post is reporting a third woman who says trump groped her when she was 23 and working at a concert at his estate ."
no offense but from pictures of the downed assailant and videos the man doesn't look middle eastern .
"after wwii , the unemployment rate for black men fell steadily up to 1965 ."
when are we gonna have an angry white man's day ?
"saddened that our officers , whom we have entrusted with our safety , behaved like this towards any woman , much less a coworker ."
i thought vj was the leader of men .
the leader of men printed more t-shirts during the bye week .
thanks to the leader of men .
"as you will recall , the murders at the quebec mosque were carried out by a white male canadian who professed to like president trump ."
and i suppose women would finally be equal if the globe & mail posted more photos and stories about women ?
so the man who changed his last name from mcdonald to muhamad and yells allahu akbar in connection with these murders is not a islamic terrorist ?
simply mindboggling that someone thinks they should tell a four year old that a man who hates us was elected president .
"way to go , dumb mothers ."
why does the article not even mention let alone discuss fathers raising the children ?
"the words father , men and man are nowhere in the article ."
"like , it's a woman's name and we all know women are inferior ."
pitts didn't cover half of what women have to endure in this country .
i read about a black woman who had to move because someone ( s ) wrote the n word all over her house and yard .
another black woman had to move because someone soak her porch in gasoline and she feared for her life .
"a jewish woman reporter wrote an article about melania , and was threatened with rape and murder ."
it goes a lot deeper than being called ladies .

"as a feminist , i abhor the niquab ."
"if i had been one of the women , i wouldn't have thought a thing about the owner of the pageant coming behind the scenes ."
- were not just insulting and otherwise bad mouthing women but assaulting and harassing and otherwise physically and emotionally exploiting and abusing them by the dozen there was nary a peep from these supposed guardians of women's rights and equality .
everybody knows that trump is strictly a small timer and mostly just a talker compared with the egregious conduct against women perpetrated by prominent democratic politicians over the years .
"how sad , these men gave their lives and their families should be taken care of !"
this woman has clearly lost her marbles .
why do they give this woman the space and ink in this paper ?
i couldnt believe that this female parrot had the temerity to keep repeating that the govt is committed to dealing with tax evasion !
"i find it very sad that a grown man would disparage others for pursuing what interests them , and suggest they are dumb because of it ."
this is a man that trump is looking to making secretary of state or in charge of some other intelligence agency .
military men are not good administrators .
but guilty men should not be anywhere national security issues ever again .
"well , what happened is that a sleazy , crooked and nasty woman ( and her sexual predator husband ) with all their money and corrupt practices were still unable to get her the presidency ."
there is much more to this bill than just unfunding abortion it harms all poor pregnant women and their children .
"since it's a white guy with a gun terrorizing the community by targeting random strangers ( as usual ) , trump hasn't commented or tweeted ."

and that one muslim woman speaks for every single muslim person out there .
how can you overlook the photogenic good looks that have landed him magazine covers and made otherwise sensible women swoon in his presence ?
"my husband paused his morning commute to stand in full of view of our neighbours , a grown man blowing kisses to a giggling three-year-old boy ."
masculine men don't love their children and show affection ?
"perhaps instead of praising this woman , we should praise all of the childless taxpayers who pay for her very generous child benefits which somehow always fail to be mentioned in these stories ."
what this is is really a non-achievement and one should instead feel for the childless person living in comparatively poor circumstances so that this woman and her ex-husband can avoid paying what in prior days would properly be their own expenses .
promises of virgins as rewards for suicide bombers lure many young men to commit these unconscionable acts .
the proof is in women ruin economies .
this ban against women priests is not now nor has it ever been a dogma .
he was also briefly married in the 1960s to a woman .
it's proven by neuroscience that women take twice as many words to make a point .
the sad thing about this woman is that it's coming clear that she actually believes her own bs .
"this statement is not true as written , would only be true for women ."
org/wiki/bill_koch_ ( skier )  if he does have more female execs on his staff might it be because he hopes to be able to grope and force himself on them while at work .

i just noticed this article was penned by a man who lives off of government what else would he say save my job pay taxes  imagine what would happen if a man were to implore other men to support male candidates just because of their gender .
no honest man would say otherwise .
this folks is a product of old media and part of the problem with granting women the right to vote .
"sarah , the big boys can be nasty but their approach is much more measured than what your brain has wrapped itself around ."
"jesus saw that one coming 2 , 000 years ago: a good man , he taught , brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart , and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart ."
it is planting heart seeds  so good to hear from women theologians !
"we need exploration of post-vatican ii theology women who , like theologian edward schillebeeckx , are not afraid to question theological roots that exalt suffering ."
it's not enough to demand of the church to change its attitudes and practices when theology underlies its conviction about the inferiority of women and its negative perspectives on other gender and sexual issues .
com the globe should be very ashamed of censoring and/or manipulating comments for political purposes on a thread about this man's life and death which only proves that individual's lives are fragile while ideologies take many centuries to die .
"also , folks need to get into a woman's head and appreciate that these rights can never roll back completely ."
"the last time society agreed abortion should be illegal , women had little autonomy ."
a post-war survey of the family famously stated that no widespread movement of women into the workforce would ever materialize .
"as a result , fewer women will remain involuntarily pregnant because they have been pivoting steadily toward toward self-actualization--notice i said actualization , not selfish self-fulfillment ."
the whole message being delivered by the unfounded series and all the follow on and related pieces is basically police don't like women and/or police don't find women credible .
last week's episode had one single lady who claims she spends $200 a month on groceries and most agreed that was impossible and now we have two men spending $250 a month ?
you can guarantee that he will continue to appoint incompetents as ministers just because they are women .
why do you support a woman who enabled a rapist for thirty years ?

"these people live on a plot owned by a black man - and he does not provide any water for all the tenants , but collects the rent ."
"i guess that 2 of the 3 responses feel that black lives really don't matter that black , unarmed men can be shot in the back but that's ok unreal ."
that will end arguments about equal prizes and pay for women .
would you buy a used thaad from that man ( trump ) ?
she sounds like a pretty amazing woman .
the system is rigged against women and people on the lower half of the income ladder .
"all the political correctness from feminists , anti-racists , gay rights advocates , transgender supporters , ethnic minorities , indigenous people defenders hasn't changed that lack of democracy one iota ."
i happen to be fully supportive of a woman's right to abortion access .
"it's just the grand-standing , the ideology of planned parenthood , as the champion of womens choice being more important than simply finding some clever way to move money around , so that any willing doctor could perform abortions ."
we used to give him employee discount off his meals where i worked when i was in college because he would eat enough for 3 grown men and was a super nice guy .
whether the woman was justified depends on what she did .
"( very similar to police defense in shooting a child with a plastic gun , or an old man they believe is reaching for a gun ."
unbelievable and this is the women who just approved a shady chinese company take over the care of our elders in bc in return for payments to the liberal party and trudeaus daddy fund .
"i hope that u of o officials will stop trying cover up the rapes of female students  i think every woman in american believed anita , and we believe this story because we all know it happens ."
and the nuclear codes are in the hands of a man well described by the dsm as a narcissist .
hersi ali did try that and said that islam needs to fix its own house first ( end subjugation of women for example ) in order to reduce the likelihood of extremism and for that criticism she had to flee europe and take up residence in the us for her personal safety .
trump was literally on tape when he talked about sexual assaulting women .

why ordain married men; why anyone ?
well there are homeless children homeless elderly homeless abused women so your last comment doesn't even make sens i would highly suggest that the author join the women's temperance league .
"i get supporting women's rights too , but get on the right topics , making the american public pay for birth control , wrong tree nancy p , you know 50% or more of american women disagree with nancy p , what is misunderstood when it comes to mainstream america and where the majority believes ?"

"i had one woman whose father died three times , she forgot she used the excuse before ."
my question is why do millions of feminists in the west condone their governments' camaraderie with oppressive regimes around the world .
why do millions protest a president who has only just been elected instead of a monarchy that holds women down with social cruelty and religious shackles over generations ?
i look forward to women in hijabs and burqas joining a slutwalk .
one would thin the globe would be cheering for le pen because she's a woman seeking high office .
she is woman hear her roar .
"rah rah rah , we have to support our female leaders ."
"if yes , why not profile loner white men with guns ?"
"it's a safe bet that if guns just magically disappeared , most or all of those same 52 women would still be killed by their current or former intimate partner , just via other means like stabbing , strangulation or bludgeoning ."
seems to me many of those same 52 women would still be alive if they had been armed and trained in the defensive use of a firearm .
who was the woman standing next to trump at the arizona memorial with the american flag draped over her shoulders .
"john it is a community medical issue and some women can not pay for bc pills on their own just as some people can not pay for vaccinations the employer , himself , is not paying for anything , he is paying for negotiated needed medical care  yes , the first and second waves of feminists were very successful , in part because women in western society already had a much better starting point from which to start than many other societies ."

"7:39 am - sep 22 , 2017 then this: the two men are given a game where they have to spin some fake news , including an item that melania voted for hillary ."
so sorry for every one at kaladi and this young man's family .
"paul says , in his first letter to the corinthians , that the women should be silent in the churches , for they are not permitted to speak ."
"he also says that every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head , for it is just as if her head were shaved ."
"finally , he points out that if they [women] wish to inquire about something , they are to ask their own husbands at home; for it is dishonorable for a woman to speak in the church ."
maybe he was afraid of something he said about women in 2005 and it was about to be released !
trudeau is right because trump is a man .

straight white cis gendered men have been a protected class since day one of this nation and we are still far more protected than any other group .
"if you are straight , white , cis gendered , and male and believe you are a victim and that equality was never the goal because others are finally getting the same protections we've had for centuries , than you don't understand equality ."
some other awards just didn't have many female nominees .
in other years women dominated the awards; that's the way things go .

"affluent leftist and 'liberal' women are often at the forefront of protests against the leaders of countries whose generalized prosperity and hard-won freedoms - won by soldiers who fought and died - enabled them to march in the streets and profess their hatred for their countries , their leaders , their customs and their democratic institutions ."

young men have always been susceptible to these sorts of influences .
funny how this woman is being vilified ( and rightfully so ) yet the woman who let the three-year-old twins drown in the backyard pool got all sorts of sympathy .
how do we know the woman in this story wasn't exhausted like everyone else was saying the twins' mother was ?
both women were 100 percent liable in their kids' deaths .

the catch is the average white man in the street has not personally benefitted from all the power it is alleged he has .
it is 2017 and this is long overdue because all women deserve total control over their reproductive health .
i stand up and furiously applaud banishing a garb which has been used to ensure women are viewed as non entities on the street .
this is nothing but cultural misogyny oppressing a woman's human rights under the guise of theocratic approval .

what kind of woman do you think i am ?
- it will likely have the unintended consequence of having more women wearing the face covering as a way of expressing oppositon to this policy .
"yes , in reference to trump's proclamation that he can grab women as he wishes ."

interesting that there appears to be no need for a counterpart study on masculinity and catholic theological ethics .
it would be interesting and informative if ncr could have a series of articles that focus on what is being written on feminism and ethics by catholic affiliated theologians and organizations .
the issue for me at is that these niqabi women get a benefit which no one else enjoys: the ability to hide one's identity from the government while taking services from it .
why should these niqabi women get this benefit ?

"in women , t is produced at least partly in the ovaries ."
"trans women don't have those , so they don't get as high of t levels ."
"besides , the idea that all women have average t levels is a complete falsehood ."
the average exists because women ( yes all of them ) are all over the map .
"either way , if you want to address the t limit in sports , be prepared to kick a lot of cisgender women out too , because that is what you would be doing ."

"the west has strongly encouraged women to enter technical fields for decades now , but they don't ."
meanwhile women from less equal countries enter in droves .
my answer is: women from india or china need to pursue tech careers for a better future .

"and if their hands are in your pockets they are getting very close to something else of yours - beware of men who wear skirts , hold hands and squat to pee ."
"if that's the case , show me the supporting evidence where women wearing niqabs/burkas have been found to be using the concealment of their identity to commit violent acts and fraud and above the national average ."

you construct a straw man and declare yourself the victor over it .

its always alarming but not surprising to see the path she draws to have a woman put before the electorate as a candidate .
"one glaring weakness in her argument is the tenuous connection between her subject and feminism , particularily the opportunistic type of feminism displayed by the current pm ."

junior has proven to be nothing like his old man .
where the women have fewer rights and immigrants and minorities know their place !
why and i ask again why do these women suddenly come out of the woods after so many years .
"as per the globe & mail article published 12/2016 , patty hajdu was the status of women minister who approved a $1 ."
these girl did not consent to having their photos added to a file with thousands of other and then distributed to their peers .

the statistic you won't see the liberal press reporting is this one: hillary got a huge percentage of the black non college educated male vote .
the justice system failed women again .
these women failed themselves by lying under oath .
yes there were a few with schizophrenia that were not allowed to leave and also women who were diagnosed as schizophrenic when they were actually experiencing postpartum depression .
it starts at home: boys need fathers to be present to have constructive masculinity modelled to them and census 2011 found that only 30% of children in sa have both parents at home ( and let's be honest: most of the absent parents are the fathers )  this poor girl was such a target of liberal ridicule on these comment boards during the harper years .
so now we have one of those young women who demonstrates the power and sheer importance of little girls going to school .

not just the fearful powerful men of the vatican offices but the role of the kochs et al and supreme council of the knights of columbus disappearing jpii's social teachings to fit a political economic agenda that is the anti-thesis of our rich social teaching tradition and the way of the christ .

sessions obsession is not almost at all the man is an idiot about it if he wasn't he would not have gone after medical cannabis at all .
the man is either obsessed or just demented and needs to be removed from office .
"however , i do agree that women who consecrate their lives to god and serve in humility as nuns ( and not as sjw ) are important ."
trump in his own voice speaks of women on that tape .
"this young man sounds , as the irish say , full of himself ."

"own a construction company as a white guy and try to get some federal , state and city contracts then name your wife as the owner and see what happens ."
we had a group of loose friends with one guy that was just off .
he met a woman who was very lonely and they had a kid .
he did not invent violence against women .
"rather , his crass language and cruel sexual innuendo is forcing our nation to confront what too many american girls and women already know ."
"it was used against the quest for civil rights for blacks , equal pay for women , and a better health insurance system ."

but it's nice to see favorable press towards female presidential contenders .
and stv does proportionally represent not only women but immigrants and specialists in the uk nhs .
encouraging women and girls to be blissfully stupid is a strange way to show you have the best interests of them in mind .
"encouraging irresponsible behavior , as nelson is unwittingly doing , actually makes it worse for those women who practice responsible behavior to receive justice when they are assaulted ."
solve that and welcome women into real leadership roles and perhaps many of the other problems will begin to be resolved .
"but i also felt rage at the fact that , 40 years after my own studies , these women are still plagued by the same issues that i confronted ."

it would be a travesty of decency to name anything after this man .

so those were the older white man the dp/dps reported last week as the culprit .
who still believes in man made holes in the ozone layer ?
"washers , driers , tvs , ac and the modern refrigerator made all of our lives easier , both housewives and single men ."

it would make more sense to ban the sale of cigarettes to pregnant women than it does to 18-21 year olds .
probably all the abuse women politicians face is a misogynist plot to keep women out of politics .
"what if they have medication for him , and he doesn't take it - that's pretty common more so with men ."
yes it is about feminism and this was obvious .
it is about ensuring that women's rights are not rolled back .

"whether they are the voices of the poor , or black or latinx , or feminists , or lgbt catholics , ncr is singular among other catholic media outlets for the range of voices it includes in its reporting and its commentary ."

"assuming this lady raised 3 healthy/happy kids , she probably knows what she's doing and you're probably reading every book you can consume ."
they already have segregated women's councils ( ncr feb 28 ) .
they will find women eager to be 'sub-deaconesses' and women eager to be on segregated women's councils .
the rest of us just have to wonder what it is with these women .
"hello sherry , how is it hypocrisy that chuck criticizes treatment of women under religionx in canada ?"
your accusation of hypocrisy seems to imply that chuck is somehow in favour of having no women priests in the catholic church .
i was being ironic sarcastic dear man .

mr matthews appears to be a man of principle leave it at that call ice and report his wife .
"at the same time , keep in mind that the usa has a lot of refugees from countries where a man can have multiple wives ."
so maybe you'll end up the second wife .

what everyone must relalize here is everyone has the same rights and this is no different than black or women or gay or what ever marches .

"if i don't pay this ridiculous medicare tax , men with guns take me to jail ."
this woman was literally begging for help .
"the author was referring to young men in general , not young muslim men only ."
nice try at setting up a straw man to easily blow down .
"most of the data the author quoted came from the usa , where muslim young men make up an insignificant fraction of the overall population of young men ."
read the article again; the point is that young men in general throughout western society are growing up without the influence of a father figure and they end up easily radicalized as a result .
the 16-year-old male may still be at large but nowhere is it clear why we care that he's at large .
i'm pretty sure that directors who are not white fare even worse - let alone non-white women directors !
"ww is a good start , but captain marvel will be a real test - a relatively unknown woman superhero who has struggled to keep a regular comic series going for years ."
captain marvel does not have the built in recognition or the built-in fan base of wonder woman .

she could bring women superheroes to a new level .

she gets a lapdog major media that will be fawning over the first woman president for at least the first year .
any serious opposition will be shouted down as an example of the war on women .
more: it could just be that the majority of hard working women actually feel comfortable with the amount of rights they have and feel they don't actually need a female president .
you should find better men for your attraction !

campbell's article is more about questioning the feminist perspective and support regarding polygamy .

"and yes , the idiots are frequently--but by no means exclusively--women ."

"my mother taught me it is priceless opportunity to teach her boys a work ethic as chickasaw women have been doing since the dawn of time , and long before whitey showed up ."
it is really a multi-racial and multi-cultural effort as the pacific voyaging society was founded by a white man and funded largely by white people .
a female anchor would be great for the national just not wendy mesley .
the woman was in no way capable of consenting .
"exclusion from the synagogue was a real excommunication ( ezra 10:8 ) , feared by the parents of the man born blind ( john 9:21 sq ."
the only ones who don't get the math are your typical sjw/ feminist and the globe and mail apparently .
the simplest response is if women were paid less they'd be hired far more which is not the case .
"when i see two black males walking on the same sidewalk as me , i cross the street ."
"lack of an appropriate male figure growing up , overidentification with your mother , bullied in grade school , and construction of a pseudo-expert persona and over intellectualization to compensate ."
sound man and a straight shooter .

as long as candidates give the illusion of preventing poor women from family planning they're good .
leftists claim that trump is a misogynist but that is easily blown apart with his record of putting competent women in charge of projects .
bill clinton and donald trump are both pigs when it comes to understanding how to treat woman .
"the more science one takes , the more one understands the humanity in a woman's womb ."
case in point: the person who equated a scarf-wearing muslim woman to a terrorist .
"frankly the idea that any catholic priest does exorcisms , or the our founders hung women for being witches isn't much better ."
i think it was used to assert his wife's superiority to the women who freely assemble to express their first amendment right to criticize our government .
what is the motivation for a man to become a priest and not a religious ?
"we can remember the history , but we should in no way honor the men who fought against the united states ."
"actually , religious women are called on to respond to their own community's charism and needs , and all these decisions should reside with them ."

while in amsterdam dutch police shot a man shouting 'allah akbar' after he attempted to knife several people .

"if you review pictures from the middle east , back around the 1900's you will notice most females did not wear these outfits ."
"i understand the burka originated in afghanistan before ad to control the movement of females who were treated as property , sold and traded ."
the burka in the hilling rocky areas prevented the female from seeing and running away .
why are you blaming this on women ?
"budget will include a host of measures specifically aimed at improving the lives of women , including a plan to fund new child-care spaces as a woman , i'm offended that child care concerns are still considered a woman's issue ."
so mostly men bring leaders of religion is not the case .
these were protests where the headgear of the day was a hat shaped like the female anatomy the potus claimed he could grab based on his fame .
pro-life women in attendance would be fifth columnists .
this is about being able to identify women for practical purposes .
"we should know it better , these people just follow trump's widmore propaganda agains woman ."
the man does not deserve to be locked up in prison .
perhaps the concept of thousands of missing and murdered women is not and has never been correct .
and btw wouldn't many of the missing women be alive and well somewhere and just not want to contact family members .
"native women are more vulnerable and more at risk , but much of that originates at the family level ."
so many women use hormone treatments with the consultation of their doctors to control their menstrual cycle for several reasons .
why gop and the religious right automatically goes to slut shaming for any woman who want to use this says more about their lack of morals and charitable than it does about the women and the doctors .
"the women are placed in areas of lots of light and noise , it is very unhealthy ."
the only thing notable about it was that it was almost all women .
over 15 women came forward to say they had been sexually assaulted by trump .
"just what we need , 1 old white guy replacing an older white guy the alaska legislature could just as easily be from texas ."
call the police and stop whining 'lady' .
eg: women in stem careers may actually be better at their jobs because they have overcome certain societal pressures as well as any genetic disadvantage to achieve what they have achieved .
we should just cut to the chase and start buying up dunking stools with male size seats .
i also think it's a big mistake for any man to purchase a ring without knowing what the answer would be first .
you're a brave man to step into the cesspool that is the trump administration .
'trump’s tweets “a man of impeccable credentials .
"right , and clinton didn't have sex with 'that woman' just because she felted him ."
boeckmann had arranged for a third party to threaten a man who had complained about the abuse to state investigators .
a judge who threatens a man for reporting abuse ?

"she is a role model for every girl in canada who won't get asked to the prom just because a woman lacks beauty , grace and charm is no reason why she can't grow up to be a parasite ."
what a sleaze many women are coming forward .
"since a zygote cannot exist without the body of a woman and since the woman is capable of withdrawing of consent as well of physically removing the zygote from her body , i don't see the point of your argument although you're welcome to it ."
"being born of the male sex , i don't see how you have access to a zygote , mr ."
"sylwester , but should technology allow you one day to have female reproductive organs capable of producing and sustaining the life of a zygote , by all means , get one of your own ."
"in the meantime , you are entitled to philosophize about the existential status of women's zygotes ."
"you might become confused that you can legitimately own or control women's zygotes , an obviously ridiculous proposition ."
"we've had bifurcated synods on the family which accomplished nothing , we've got a group studying female deacons for at least a year with no action; we've had a commission on clergy abuse of minors and we all know how well that has been going ."
so cosby apparently molested or raped around 60 women in america over a 40 year period .
none of the other 60 women over 40 years laid a charge when they were molested or raped .
and the 1 woman who is now accusing him on the charge he is facing waited over 10 years to blow the whistle .
the fact that he involved himself with so many women and none of them charged him criminally raised some doubt that this one is any different .
"my comment about tall , attractive men was in response to a male poster who implied that tall , attractive guys are bad boys ."
"to paraphrase , when white men are constantly hearing about how evil and problematic and racist they are , they are reduced in a way that isn't very different from a lot of anti-black racism ."
when has the auscp ever spoken out against women priests ?
"many asian women did indeed provide “comfort” services to the japanese imperial forces during world war ii , but i do not believe they did it at the point of a gun nor was it sexual slavery ."
"throughout history , military forces have had no problem finding “comfort women” regardless of the country in which they operated and they were able to find them without kidnapping , coercion or threats of any kind ."
"for many women , it was the use of their bodies , and there usually was more supply than demand ."
"some members of the imperial japanese forces no doubt forced women to have sex , which , of course , is rape , but i believe the “comfort women” who served the imperial japanese forces in brothels that sprung up and operated near japanese bases did so voluntarily for pay ."
she shouldn't be trusted by the sexy ho of the day because she has a proven track record as a betrayer .
why does it have to be a guy ?
some of the sycophants are going on about how she is supposed to attract college educated white women for trump .
that should attract a lot of college educated white women voters .
you can bliksem women on camera and still earn a salary at the com-rat club !
the real story is that so many people including women don't care .
you condemn ivanka trump's plea for support of a fund for entrepreneurial women .
"but in the case of the woman involved in this trial , as far as i can see , she didn’t do anything to anyone ."
"seriously , i'm liking genesis 2:7 the lord god formed man of dust from the ground , and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being ."
repeating the same election narratives that trump is a racist and hates women and gays .
"perhaps , in the interests of vibrant multiculturalism , trudeau should propose the order of canada for osama bin laden and his merry men , al-quaeda ."
"it is somehow the fault of the western people going to markets and music halls and popular bars who are pushing lovely muslim young men into isis , because there is just too much islamophobia among those crowds of westerners frequenting the markets and music halls and bars ."

"both hillary and bill clinton have abused the government levers of powers and our tax dollars to destroy women over the years and if hillary is elected she will not hesitate to use those same levers of powers to finally destroy brodderick , wiley , monica , paula jones and the many other women who have spoken and voted against her ."
this story should be conjoined along with the story lawsuit: big isle police used stun gun on wrong man .
"yes that is the problem who is the mysterious person , this great sucker ( a man no doubt ) who is suppose to be the ll for canadians ?"
i'd make this fantastic woman president tomorrow .
i see no clean hands here but trump does not claim to be a champion of women victims rights .
one grabs crotches and the other attacks the women when they come forward .
"in business , white said , “men will invest in patent rights and meet with heavy losses , and it is taken as a matter of course ."
"but in the work and cause of god , men are afraid to venture ."
she was an adult woman involved in a consensual affair with bill clinton .
i believe many of these women who are now claiming sexual abuse or harassment willingly participated in the belief it would somehow help their acting careers .
president clinton said that getting a blow job in the oval office was not 'sex with that woman' on national tv with hillary nodding her head as he spoke .
how would one determine what the common practice is for these woman in private ?
"citizen , and maybe the first lady ."
i suspect the mad cow disease comment by the author ( he says he wrote satire ) is a satire on and an insult to the many women who have marched in protest against trump's indecency toward women .
"it takes repression of women's human freedom as far as as any thought system ever has , i don't see how anyone can rationally refute that , and no one has ."
the extreme erasure of women from pubic space .

i predicted accurately in my post that there will be women coming forward regarding donald's behavior .
"if ordinary means a money laundering , female assaulting , foul-mouthed , mentally ill tax cheat who got his money by bullying and breaking laws , then sure ."

most definitely useless in the bush at -40c next  so let me get this straight hillary clinton; a political parasite and the most corrupt woman in government for the last 30 years straight who is incapable of telling the truth to anyone even when its a better answer than the lie she tells .

this is too rich coming from a journalist for a feminist magazine .
the fact there is also a large feminist audience means guaranteed customers for this particular writer's pov .
"the fact that there are relatively fewer women in computer programming in spite of decades of affirmative action and encouraging women to enter the field , tells us something about our society and the desire/ability of women to perform that type of work ."
it is also not surprising that a blinkered feminist journalist is unable to hear what it is saying .
the cpc is yesterday's party filled with yesterday's men selling yesterday's ideas .
"half man , half bear , half pig = global warming tinfoil hat clown shoe ."
"as i said about eight years ago on here , i think women should step away from all ministries in the church based on your interpretation , which is pretty all-or-none in its scope ."

"half of america , mostly women and rednecks with machine guns , is willfully and deliberately swimming in the sewer with donald trump ."

the girl statue is a dumb eyesore and should be chucked as soon as possible .

i'm sure boyden doesn't want to be the lonely white man who is adopted by compassionate elders as that would end his magic native status with white canada .
i know about 20 other ladies that are also workers .
"let's see , tall white males , skinny white males , fat white males , pink-skinned white males , orange-skinned white males , spray-tanned white males ."
which is why women can't be ordained .
i do realize there are women in the church .
and there is a place for women in the church .
"if a church tries to limit women , then no one should be surprised if women look elsewhere for spiritual fulfillment ."
good god could pm pretty man trudeau have made a worse choice ?

"assuming she is female , she could be one of those trans things , i am sure her defense will be , he tried to rape me ."
tone-deaf feminists spamming the g&m with specious articles =/= actual evidence .
i find stories about minority-elect president trump amusing ( like the man himself ) .
"since oligarchy-wood went politics so am i meet the terrorist behind the next women’s march when you rip the cover off the headlines you see the liberal scum underneath rasmea yousef odeh , a convicted terrorist ."
com/2017/02/25/the-next-womens-march-is-co-organized-by-a-terrorist/ obviously this professor is nothing more then a hypocritical misanthrope at best .
would uaa allowed this sort of art to go on their wall if the head of black man is being held by a white guy ?
the article states that the woman's car must be an suv .
"however , all of the listed woman-firendly features can be found in a small car , and , as well , very few of the listed vehicles are actually suv' if you don't explicitly renounce the abrahamistic elements of biblical psychotic male exploitation and genocide , than you are a criminal-minded terrorist by ideology and may deserve to be given no quarter in civilized society ."
"i find it hypocritical of this paper in 2012 judged a renewed popularity of catholic women who wear chapel veils to be a sign of veiled paternalism; yet , defend muslim women in this article , they [muslim women] view it alternately as a sign of religious devotion , discipline , freedom from western expectations , or simply a way to be in a continuous state of prayer ."
"so , you agree then that csu should not be subsidizing football ( any more than they do for an individual woman's sport ) and football should also pay for the football stadium ."
"i love the disconnect between bailey attending a somewhat scary church ( female submission , anti-gay ) and being a progressive ."
"gay people , co-habitors , feminists should consider whether they want bailey to lead the city , given his almost schizoid spirituality ( my church is great even if the doctrines and clergy are backwards and bigoted ) ."
"why post such a sarcastic , cutting comment about a man who contributed so much ?"
the crisis is about evil men who entered the priesthood under false pretenses and used its auspices for access to teenage boys .
"may i repeat , imo , making a man whose history of behaviors reads like the definition of a sociopath , the most powerful person in the world , is a terrible idea ."
gary crum can't believe they pay this woman to write columns !
"bet you're looking forward to wearing your brown shirts  from the article: if this means that the judge was ruling that until a woman loses consciousness she cannot be said to be “incapable of consent , ” then he has made a legal error ."
trudeau is showing what feminism means .
they have a tendency throwing women under the bus when something goes wrong .
only a twit doesn't realize that any man made contrivance comes with energy and material inputs that result in initial pollution .
no pride and honor among men ?
"this woman and obama are evil deep state , and there's many in the democratic party just like her ."
first of all i am a black man .
this old woman should not have any say in running the organization if that is what her leadership is about .
and this old woman who is president is trying to make herself relevant .
interesting how they march against trump but allow bill clinton to rape women all over the place then get outed for being on pedo the plane with the pedophile hedge fund guy .
no go back and say hi to your female partner that you think is mated to you .
"he isn't crazy and this wasn't the first girl he's raped but why come forward when they aren't even off the streets a year this all makes me so very sick to my stomach i won't fake the front as far as sins go i'm no better than he is that's why ill see you in hell maxx you still have another women's life to answer for  some people do not like the phrase black lives matter not because those lives don't matter , but because we should be joining together to say all lives matter ."
why do governments and municipal politicians across western europe ignore the societal division and segregation as if it's normal for women to be yelled at and intimated for not covering their hair ?
"the man is vapid of intelligence , lacking education , nuance of government and diplomacy , and in summary unfit to be a janitor let alone president of the us which brings me to his electorate sad that a man of his limited success has managed to convince the working class that he is their man he is no more their man than he was man to his wives a cheater and liar in his personal life , no different as an elected official but his followers don't seem to care yet ."
how many women in your seminary are seminarians ?
i just watched the medal ceremony for the women' s hurdlers who swept that event and not one of them put their hand over their heart & the gold medal winner didn't even sing one word of it .
he is a tremendous advocate for women in business - often stating most of his successes are due to the business capabilities of women .
what i am trying very hard to do with these responses is to separate feelings and opinion of the man with what he is actually doing / not doing and provide some context .
a man who admits a mistake - i like it !
"i follow jesus too but he never said anything about the priesthood , much less about male only priesthood ."
trump is a man who speaks very strongly about who/what he likes/dislikes .
and cue the feminist apologists who will look right past legitimate critique of this piece as full-bore paranoia and fear-mongering .
his suits look like they came from the two-for-one pants sale at tip top .
there are 1600 men in the company we contract to that have been layed off for 2 years who will be going back to work next year rebuilding line 3 .
the story says that the rapes were in relation to a young female in a whole different matter .
"i doubt trump confronted putin , and cooperation is not in the vocabulary of either of the 2 men ."
"i've always been fascinated by the fact that many men ( lieber and stoller , lester sil , bihari bros , ertegun bros , who wrote and produced such stand-out r&b records ( coasters , laverne baker , bb king , the drifters , clyde mcphatter , ben e ."
mean women are weak and at their core fearful of actually living .
reading this i cannot help but think about all the women leader bullies i encountered in my career who believe this garbage about themselves .
"there's been ugly women through out history - but clinton is not only ugly through and through down to the bone - she has a vile hideous personality that's like acid to those who have to watch , listen and deal with her ."
"spent a lot of time with his large family and relatives over the last 20 years , never heard any of them talk about ignoring white man's rules ."
transgressions ha that's what you call it slick willy has a long list of women who clam everything from sexual harassment to rape and all of them say they were intimidated and threatened some even were in fear for their lives it all speaks to the kind of low life's the clintons really are ?
but it's a problem for other groups too ( particularly men of all races ) .
fabrocini said he tries to be sympathetic to people's situations and even suggested a spot where the men might be able to finish cooking the food .
"the men were not arrested or cited , he said ."
what's next is that white guy gonna make those brothers run across fields chasing pig skins while beating each other to a pulp ?
it is entirely possible that the driver's license system has stopped someone yes and it is possible man never went to the moon .
"there a many non locals in the school i hear there's a catholic church in laurelhurst somewhere with a gay trans woman for a priest , where everyone defines god for themselves and mondays are for meditation and yoga and thursdays are vegan dinners for the homeless ."
org/portland/ sigh can the globe ever stop with stem and women .
"it is not as though women in ontario haven't had 25+ years of support for stem , maybe just maybe they don't want to work for the soulless it departments of the amazon's of the world or in certain aspects of tech ."
"because tech such as biology , medicine , chemical engineering , etc is full of women who perform very capably ."
a wonderful man and a true defender of the faith .
man you nut job left wingers love to deny r this nice looking lady can patrol my hood anytime  gimme a break .
"why doesnt the author lash out at the extremist that are beheading and killing women , christians and gays ."
in many cultures treating women as equals is a non-starter but that is perhaps a secondary issue .
i have just ordered kuriaki fitzgerald's book on women deacons in the orthodox church .
and you did not address my concerns as a woman .
"thanks for pointing out how hindu and muslim attitudes to women are actually very similar , they are ."
"and it seems hard for you to understand that as a woman , i am scared witless by people like you who seem totally oblivious to reality , and have not addressed my concerns at all ."
"as a western woman , i realize just how fragile the freedoms i take for granted are when masses of people like you and torontoguy sing the praises of muslim society as superior ."
one of the women is known to be the end of the world is coming fear monger .
"of course he was appealing to his base , so he wanted to sound like a man who gets his hands dirty with work , but somehow i don't think he ever has and prefers donations from the likes of the koch brothers so he can carry on with disseminating right wing messages that will further enrich them both at the expense of the proletariat ."
"is obedience not a virtue to strive for , the fall of man was rooted in disobedience ."
"if 41 can't control himself around women , the women should be , at the very least , warned ."
many are also muslim fundamentalists for whom birth control and education for women are an anathema .
"simply because your well-endowed girlfriends ( uh , huh ) loved to show off their assets when healthy , doesn't mean that a dying ( article said incapacitated ) man gets the same thrill ."
what a strange argument for viewing a man's private parts at the point of death .
com/news/us-news/abortion-clinics-report-threats-violence-rise-n719426 americans have allowed these people to force their views on american women .
or we can start doing to churches what they have done to american women .
"respect women's privacy or we'll tear this country apart , starting with the churches ."
outsider77: the only part of your post i disagree with is you mentioned this young woman as being attractive did you look at her pictures ?
"i have seen more attractive women among the travelers they were dirty , but attractive ok , ok , beauty is in the eye of the beholder ."
"2 ) is in some cases , very medically necessary 3 ) in other cases , necessary for the mental health of the mother in case of incest or rape pp does has done far more to prevent unwanted pregnancies than rtl has ever done ."
it's interested in shaming women and reducing the control they rightfully should have over their bodies and ensuring they and their doctor are given ever-restrictive options on their reproductive health .
and mostly those good blue collar jobs were far more dangerous and left the men ( are we are overwhelmingly speaking of men here ) worn out by the time they were 60 .
"a woman very involved in her parish and fund raising was challenged by a religious sister this way: you are doing church work , but you could be doing the work of the church ."
the woman is now a dedicated community organizer working for justice and the poor .
"since it may infringe on women lives if they have children , just import all the needed children for the next generation ( migrants ) and this way no woman must be troubled you're sexist and a horrible person if you disagree with me too ."
but those non-abortion rights have been long secured and are no longer the glue that holds the women's movement together .
"yes , we have as a president a man who refuses to disavow virulent white anti-black , anti-jew racism by scum like the aryan nation , half of whom are in prison for various truly nasty felonies ."
the defense lawyer argued that the young woman was voluntarily participating in the bondage and torture .
"the fn chiefs already know the answers they are looking for but refuse to accept that indigenous men are the culprits: exactly , they will not accept anything other than it is all the white man's fault ."
"so , could it be that the transgendered woman had testicles surgically added to her body , then changed her mind and wanted them off ?"
lol the woman is a blithering idjit .
"if you think the new testament is sick and that we read the epistles of a sick man at mass , i don't think i can help you ."
i can appreciate ( maybe i am naive ) the greater willingness of the feminine to forgive but until women stand in an authoritative way nothing will change .
"i , for one , will stand with women; i will argue but , will not stand without the women ."
this young man just ruined his life for a long time to come .
it looks like an ass kicking contest for one legged men .
what you're seeing on tv now might be the typical american woman .
i love women; i despite this lot .
a sad pathetic comment about a brave man .
"if you can be civil and won't try to force your ancient fantasies on me and especially women and gays , then it's all fine and dandy !"
: )  this man here is a big fan of sexual assault !
"when amy mcgrath was 13 , her congressman wrote her a letter saying that women ought to be protected and not allowed to serve in combat ."
so you approve of men in power propositioning and having affairs with the people they employ ?
the dental school issue was a problem because men who think rape is funny simply can't be trusted to administer anaesthetics and behave professionally unconscious patients .
"and yes , he is a self made man ."
what do you call a woman who takes money from a disreputable character for services rendered ?
"on the left , we have those that support a woman's right to choose , coupled with an increased burden to taxpayers to support children born to less affluent parents ."
walk in the shoes of a black man and perhaps you'll understand .
"therefore , i assume you're against harassment of women at abortion clinics ."
the ones that think killing women and children is fine as long as they aren't your women and children you're sick simply another false narrative here crying about not enough of__fill in the blank__ in certain positions .
what ever happened to all men are created equal ?
"being condescending to a conservative woman which carries over to conservative women , and women in general when you think about it ."
apparently you haven't been paying attention to trump's twitter account or audio records of him talking about assaulting women ?
"but remember , no one respects women more than little hands ."
"glad he got the prize but , as he's a man , i don't doubt it completely flew over his head that he was getting the silent treatment ."
"when it comes to disrespect , especially women , nobody does it better than you don ."
"he later added: “although i will say , i have one daughter and there is something very special about imagining a woman prime minister ."
"i think it is wonderful witness to the grace of christ that this man who was steeped in racism as as young man was able to shake off these shackles , turn his life around and dedicate himself to building up the people of god ."
i love the deniers posting here that women have no need to demonstrate as they have it all already .
"man , that punt that came down on the 4 inch line was something ."
"trump is one great man , fighting against a tsunami of weak , spoiled children ."
# your equalization check - is generated by men such as mr georg as someone who was way off on the duke lax case i'm not going to assume anything .
virginia showed that suburbanites are not going to be a given for them and this could further alienate college educated women who are not pleased with the current administration .
"since election day 20 , 000 women have signed up per emily's list to run for office ."
the man is completely out of touch with reality .
trudeau i did not have sexual relations with that woman .
at trumps speech the liberal women in white came across as goofs as well .
"if the writers of today's story are this crazy , maybe we need to reconsider if women are are ready to be president ."
"canadian girl - the same question has been asked for at least the past 200 years and we're doing better than ever i guess because we live next to the us it raises some of these questions , whereas compared to europe and asia , our taxes are quite low man you live in a sick delusional world of stupid , there is still not any evidence that proves mans carbon is doing anything bad or heating the climate , non i didn't lose any sleep over a women-only screening of wonder woman , but as the author mentioned , there is an issue of legality ."
"my mother , being 73 at the time , fell into a category of what they call fast progression ( older female ) ."
"ergo , there is no infallible prohibition of women priests ."
the teaching about marriage and sexuality isn't worked up by men; it falls out nicely from scripture .
"trump grabs women in the front , not the behind ."
"living in the us for over 40 years as an oriental catholic women , i experienced the most ‘majority’ clergies including nuns practice racial prejudice knowingly or unknowingly ."
will they ban drag if it offends feminists .
"patch: a ) boy b ) girl c ) both of the above d ) neither of the above frankly , i really don't care and hope others feel the same ."
he is a grown man not a child .
i am always amazed just how much time and energy the tightie righties spend talking about gay male sex .
international women's day - $650 million for reproductive health and rights around the world trudeau says canada will give syria $840m after chemical weapons attack by assad - april 5 2017 the mandan princess said the same thing .
the primary consequence of prohibition would be to enshrine in law the premise that women do not have a right to choose not to bear a pregnancy to term and give birth .
"women's human capacities of conscience and choice in the disposition of their bodies , would be stripped from them in the event of pregnancy , rendering them slaves , or beasts , with respect to giving birth ."
"one may be pro-life , without endorsing the perverse cruelty of using pregnancy as the excuse for diminishing women's own personhood ."
do worry in about 2 generations the women will be dressed like every other canadian .
"16 year old girls are more than ready for sex , 15 for sure and some 14 year olds ."
"no i'm not saying old geezers should be chasing teens but seriously girls want to know , men come in all shapes and sizes and ages ."
perfect example of why women stay quiet about sexual harassment .
if muslim women fee the need to be subjigated there are lots of countries in the world where they will be accomodated .
i wish i could see her go back in time to chat with the women who fought to obtain the rights our columnist enjoys today .
can't take the reality that our new first lady is a porn star .
i think it's sad that a man like gerald soloway who developed a great company should be vilified for the one mistake of a great career .
"i'm sure a 90 year-old african-canadian woman has seen a lot of ugly racism in her time , but i'm not sure what that has to do with anti-muslim bigotry  hi my name is christy jones , my daughter taylor and i have been watching ax men since it first aired ."
ax men showed people that didnt even have a clue really how dangerous logging truly is .
god bless i resent this woman casting aspersions on long time canadians .
"time for another boxing match , but this time not with a cocaine addled woman beating journeyman ."
man baby trump and his baby followers only you would complain about a pinata .
i think they were responding to the fact that one man-made environment is attractive and the other is not .
"man , you are one smart cookie ."
"a great athlete , an even better man ."
admitting women to ordination will not be a cure-all for clericalism .
the involvement of women however would set back clericalism and institutionalism by centuries .
who will make sandwiches and iron the vestments if women are allowed to be priests ?
"after successfully stealing women and liberal votes from clinton and sabotaging her campaign , why not raise your own profile a bit more ?"
men tend to want power to achieve an end .
deal with the fact that it is the powerful ( mostly male ) and those without power and it is about coercive sex or just plain rape .
a stunning reversal for the man child .
the only issue is recruiting enough female leaders .
jesus did not chose any women to be apostles .
"therefore , woman cannot be ordained as priests ."
"since the church's prohibition of women priests uses the gospels as a negative proof , the church's prohibition , using your own words , is an exercise in complete illogic ."
"also , it wasn't a player that said it ( although the press tries to bait men every year at wimbledon ) , it was the ( former ) indian wells tournament director old dude ."
"i would bet that , every day , hundreds of young women leave hollywood and go back home to normal lives because they weren't willing to do what it would take to become a star ."
"there are some interesting studies about the effects of estrogenic products used in the poultry and meat industries on male fertility , and for that matter , in the general environment ."
yes but look at where women go once in medicine and you see the same split as you do with the stem .
"what about all your angry white men attacking non whites in their offices , clinics and churches ?"
wasn't it a white guy that parked a yellow ryder truck filled with anfo outside the oklahoma city building with a child care center in it ?

"they were not muslim women , but allowing a segment of society to normalize such clothing created a situation where the criminal’s “disguise” raised little notice or suspicion as they travelled to and from their mark and made them near impossible to identify ."
they also have a very high infertility rate in males .
"many good men become priests , but they are not stand-ins for jesus or god ."
the masculinity of jesus is immaterial to his being god .
we the people are sick of the same ol same ol good ol boy club for a lack of a better term .
so in effect that is what has brought a man like trump to be where he is now in politics .
the man killed in minnesota had some speeding tickets and was pulled over once for not wearing a seat belt .
the focus needs to stay on trump's sexual assaults agains various women .
that one's still on the front burner with women .
"there were stage fulls of celebrities and entertainers who seemed ready to endorse trump scott baio remember him , and the former male underwear model turned born again anthony sabato jr who was the underwear model of choice for all kinds of male homosexuals ."
"i don't know , or have ever met any woman that goes to planned parenthood for anything ."

i am not talking about verbal assault or visual assault what woman doesn't experience those regularly so those stats would be much closer to 100% .
because women know they won't be believed  i treat women who i see here in hijabs with the utmost of respect .
all sda female pastors standing in line to be ordained should be given a nobel prize for peace .
if only the sda church and her treatment of women would be more known in the world i bet that there would be a recognition of their ( women's ) struggle and pain .
"folks he is referring to a sketch by monty python ( /män ( t ) ē/ /ˈpīˌthän ) a british surreal comedy group known for having a go at some of the more absurd customs and social norms , which pretty much defined proper english society right up until the early to mid 70's or so ."
"huffman ( tip of the hat to you ) is referring is about a catholic yorkshire man , his wife , and 62 ( 63 by the first verse ) children , some who are going to have to be sold for medical experiments because the mill is closing , and the family can't afford to feed them ."
"there might have been fringe activists who have said it , but beyond them there has been no such narrative that all men are rapists ."
"i don't recall this manifesto suggesting that women were unsuited to stem fields , rather , it suggested that women tend to _prefer_ other roles ."
"this is something that is confirmed by my own experience - fewer women apply for such careers , and more of those women in such careers move on to other roles ."
these women are harming society as a whole .
"ladies and gents , you are witnessing the end of trump , thank you jesus !"
"i am confident in the stand i take on this issue , women are indeed the victims of real crimes on the basis of their gender and they do not occur in the public restrooms of alaska , the safest place for any women in america , unfortunately , is too often not her own home ."

i don't see why a woman cannot simply go to a hospital ( which by law they cannot turn a woman down ) and have the baby delivered ?
"in fact , an abortion still operates through the canal into a woman's uterus ."
"i guess i don't have the right to tell a woman that she cannot shoot heroin , rob a bank , drive wrecklessly , or to commit murder which is what abortion is ."
there is no law stating that woman can get an abortion at any time without restriction .
"the structure is hierarchical and monarchical and unaccountable in the end , leaving women in second-class citizen status under catholicism and gays , pro-choice advocates , and pro-contraception persons in the sinner category ."

i did not realize the asian women is a public school teacher but prior to that knowledge was thinking about making an unflattering comment about hawaii public school but will do so now .
"yeah , it's totally standing up for women's rights by forcing women to dress a certain way !"
but i think carlos's point was that a pad can satisfy a woman's needs just as well .
"i believe that if you asked trump whether he respects women and minorities , he would say yes ."
what if it were a deceased woman and a bunch of guys stood around leering at the corpse .
these angry white men feel like they have been robbed of something .
i think kelly is the right man to try and manage the president a bit more but i'm more troubled that mcmaster is still around .
he's a muslim barry man and that is nothing but bad news .
this has been seen in a variety of numbers we have working class white males who for the last forty years have felt like they were losing ground they are !
"working class black mem and white men have a lot in common helping to raise families , paying for college , dealing with a spouse who works too ."
"americans saw the pointy hat , broomstick wielding bag lady , as a pantsuit continuation of corruption as usual ."
"you apparently believe all men are rapists and bullies , so i must ask: does that include you ?"
"and , according to you , these men didn't just run away--they voted for trump ."
i guess this woman just didn't resist sufficiently enough and allowed herself to be overwhelmed by her desire for a quick profit ?
"at age 31 , it's time to be your own man , and not hide behind daddy ."
"it's not surprising that he'd want to meet duterte , who is without a doubt a tough guy ."
"no , such a woman might be too stupid to know that she is stupid to vote for trump ."
i'm sure there are many tech-savvy white males who are conservatives .
"also no one wants to go here , but over half the dr's are female and they generally only work part time hours ."
"those of us that honor truth , integrity , the rule of law and the premise that all men are created equal must stand and face the evil that lurks in the heart of people that believe otherwise and would do you harm ."

she was and will continue to be a roll model for young women of today .

she wouldn't stand a chance against a man with class and dignity .

"what a beautiful young man , husband , and father , not to mention son of proud parents ."
it is against the law in canada to beat or rape women .
under sharia law they are encouraged to beat and rape women !
it also reports separately on a 2013 study on women who wear the niqab in canada .
"there is no slightest indication that the three women reported on were even included among the research subjects , much less that they were all the research subjects ."
perhaps we will see some new ideas for revitalizing the clergy rise to gain consideration instead of rehashing the celibacy and women's ordination issues that have failed for 50 years now to gain acceptance .
"if you look at all the media today that features self-confident , assertive girls moving into leadership positions and in the school system where , apparently , though scarcely discussed , there is the boy problem where many boys arrive at high school substantially demotivated as they have been told over and over that they really aren't doing all that well and have come to accept it and at universities now where ( apparently ) 60% of the undergrads are now girls and -- what was the point that leah was trying to make ?"
educated women change their minds in their 40's which is very selfish of them .
what they found is that a high percentage of those ( mostly male drivers ) were sexually frustrated .
but it seems americans love this type of man a true mans man or a manly man or perhaps just a insecure narcissist who gets off on bullying people into silence or submission .
our president of the united states the man child .
"looks like a 3-man race , to me ."
i'm still wondering why a woman sitting in parked vehicle ( which the bear would see as a nonthreatening inanimate object ) would think a wild bear would go away after being told shoo !
"a good portion of the country is behaving like an abused woman who can't get away from her abuser , but instead continues to believe that he is a basically a good guy , he just has issues ."
"discriminating against potential allies ( in this case sympathetic men ) because of their gender , their skin colour , or any other trait they have no control over , is simply dumb ."
then you have the burqa and the niqab - the islamist's dress code for females .
i might not get out of my vehicle until the situation was clear but yes -- two men lying half naked along a remote mountain road is highly unusual and i would guess ( as most reasonable people would ) that something is wrong .
"constitution , scum like trump and the religious freak republicans can take away women's rights with a stroke of a pen ."
"that's when most all the women rather than just some of us , will be carrying , organizing , and putting time in at the shooting range ."
"there are millions of young men in the west without a father figure and who are exposed to different religions and superstitions of catholics , anglicans , lutherans , presbyterians , judaism etc and don't become suicide bombers ."
ordaining women is not something the church is arbitrarily refusing to do--just because some old men want to cling to outdated notions concerning gender responsibilities and relations .
the church is not ordaining women because it is not possible .
do you have trouble paying women to sleep with you ?
"such handsome men ♥️ col , this is , of course , a big piece of the problem ."
"such a man would likely be swept to the papacy by a laity who longs for justice , compassion and love ."
"the conservatives came out as pro-womens equality by suggesting the banning of the niqab at citizenship ceremonies , a wildly popular move in quebec ."
"now cassandra is trying to pose as a friend of muslims , the very group that oppresses women , how can she be against the subjugation of women vis-à-vis anti-trump , and yet be pro-muslim ?"
kenney knows from experience how hard it is to battle the leftie straw man regarding the social conservative hidden agenda .
"if not then wow , i mean you are defending a symbol of female oppression that is only common in countries where canada's liberal values are non-existent: gender equality , freedom of association ( people are killed for apostasy and blasphemy ) , lgbt rights , and freedom of expression ( people are lynched for religious satire and comedy ) ."
it's not a coincidence that in every single country where the niqab is common that women are subjugated as second class citizens ( often under the threat of violence ) .
growing up in this world is difficult enough for a youngster without the confusion of being in a locker room seeing what they thought was a woman undress in front of them .

"under equal protection , whether that person is a fetus or a 50-year old man , the penalties must be the same ."
only a pos would abuse a dead woman to attack another .
she was the nominee of the party that supports feminism and civil rights .
"it's a long story , and part of that story was the aggressive response to her unconventional profile as first lady ever since bill clinton was governor of arkansas ."
why is it okay when trump says it but not a female legislator ?
"laurie dunnagan - you said it , girl !"
"if a person who is clearly a man wants to identity as a women--and get a doctor to perform surgery to make the man look like a women , that is their business ."
that does not make them a women--and that is not an obligation on me to recognize them as a women .
"here is a breakdown of ethnicity and incarceration status in the states ( from wikipedia ) : in 2014 , 6% of all black males ages 30 to 39 were in prison , compared to 2% of hispanic and 1% of white males in the same age group ."

"i'm 30 and i don't drink , do drugs or fall for the feminist crap that modern women are a part of ."
i also don't appreciate that you put all young women in this nutty modern woman category .
isn't that possibility of that outcome the very reason we are having the national inquiry into missing and murdered aboriginal women ?
"if so you are the last person on earth who does , excluding well-trained terrorist and us white male teenagers ."
"however , in any civil society there must be consequences for base , vulgar , illegal activities like sexually assaulting multiple women-as soon as he has served his prison sentence i would welcome him back to the community with open arms ."
i am a 53 year old woman and last year my mother gave me a coupon for $2 off adult diapers .

currently 70% of the african american births are to single women .
i've spoken directly with a man who insisted that the mosque shooting in quebec was the act of islamic terrorists .
the country was founded on a select group of men making decisions by electing other men to act on their behalf .

"'of all the animals , man is the only one that is cruel ."
at that time it seemed to be an erotica book aimed at a female readers who probably got many hours of pleasant arousal from reading it .

"tell me trumpanzees , how this is beneficial for the common man , blue collar workers , etc ."
christine needs to have hope that francis is improving the situation of women in the church .
"as long as women are kept out of the priesthood , we will not be fully equal in the church ."
francis has done nothing to enable the ordination of women or to dismantle the clerical structure and culture in the catholic church .
"telling women to wait and be patient is no different from what those opposed to dismantling segregation loved telling african americans -- just be patient , and your time will come  i am yet to see trump at a segregated mosque , so which of these two characters treat women as equals ?"
"maria goretti was 11 years old when she refused the advances of a young man , who then stabbed her 14 times ."
"she defended her faith , telling the man that muslims are good people ."
i suspect that many are like myself in that i have never encountered a woman in this article of clothing .
"63 year old woman leaving a pharmacy in lower etobicoke robbed of 600 oxycodone , 420 oxycocet & 120 diazepam ."
cause dollars for donuts the two scallywags that knocked this elderly woman down knew precisely what she had stuffed in her purse .
"the woman , her dr ( s ) , and the pharmacist all belong in jail ."
"the lady at guadalupe has been popular , i suppose she is similar to indigenous belief ?"
but not one image of mary except for a blue-robed woman at the last supper ?

"ladies on this panel , we are so blessed by god to have been born in america , and further blessed by the courage of the women sufragettes , some of whom died to make our votes possible please vote on nov ."
takes a really 'big man' with loads of character to cheer about another team's injuries .
"that aside , i applaud these women for taking necessary steps to protect themselves ."
she'll probably even give to a women's charity for that added special effect .
that's no way to treat a middle age woman forced to recant the truth by the msm !
"how do we display ourselves , how do we present ourselves as women , what are we asking ?"
"you look at everything all over the world today , you know , and how women are dressing and , you know , what they're asking by just presenting themselves the way they do ."
you seem to imply girls should be in the room for a boy to accomplish anything .
"boy scouts no , not inclusive for something not solely for what it's intended , boys ."
"did not god tell samuel , 1 sam 16:7 , not as man sees does god see , but god looks into the heart ."
how would a lifelong celibate know that contraception would turn a woman into a mere instrument of selfish enjoyment ?

"so it's pretty much the same experience that women have , except throw in some sexual harassment as well ."
i think the pain that women talk about during childbirth is exaggerated .
"i know it's an extreme analogy , but what is the reaction of women reading that statement ."

"the people who pray for the women and unborn in front of abortion mills are there doing works of mercy , on their own dime ."
somehow eugene leads the world in lazy grown young men with pitbulls mooching for food on sidewalks having the sacred right to define how the communal space is defined .
for some reason these young men alone can set the mood and look of the downtown .
who cares what women or children want ?
when you say parents you mean a single mother right ?
"on the other hand , bill clinton told the entire nation i did not have sex with that woman but was proven a liar with forensic evidence on a blue dress ."
"his wife verbally attacked the female intern then , and has now promised to give bill an important role in her administration ."
"if you care about women and cannot vote for trump because of what he said and might have done , you certainly can't vote for clinton for what she and her husband actually said and did ."
two ladies and an 80-year-old war hero showed tremendous courage in this vote and stood up to a bully .
proud one of the ladies represents alaska .
"the services it provides: 95%: contraception , breast cancer screening , pap smears , immunizations , well women care , std screening and treatment , other gynecological treatment , other primary care services ."
very few black women are impregnated by whites .
it's the education system infantilizing men ?
so how do you explain successful males ?
good for this man and others who will benefit .
"no , the problem here is that you rationalize that is ok to put the woman who publically attacked bill clinton's victims with the same language trump has , privately pressured them not to bring charges into the whitehouse because her rapist husband isn't running for office ."
"newt exposed megyn , in her comment she said , but i am fascinated by the protection of women and understanding what we're getting in the oval office , and i think the american voters would like to know her biased coverage over trump is all about getting a woman in the whitehouse ."
it also has nothing to do with the commission on missing and murdered indigenous women .
"just as in 1980 , nobody came to our defence because we gay men are still disposable ( until those politicians want us to vote for them , and then they tell us how much they love us ) ."

that women may fabricate stories of spousal sexual assault to gain an upper hand in custody and access disputes is very definitely not a myth .
the human hunter desires the biggest male with the biggest set of horns with subsistence meat as just a messy sidelight .
large males provide the greatest amount of meat .
how do we present ourselves as women ?
more than 60% of the women seeking abortion have reported that they were on birth control at the time of conception .
"the new york times ran a story a few years ago that basically stated if a woman was on hormonal birth control for ten years , the likeliness that she would have a failure of said birth control was nearly 100% ."
the answer is women need to have a better understanding their bodies and fertility .
two loving partners can determine whether or not the female is fertile on any given day .
we *do* have big government building codes and occupancy standards and guess how much good they did this woman ?
"his mother mary , st john , and some women , and maybe a few curious onlookers and some vicious spectators ?"

"jim , we need to hear good responses to the wild claims of religious freedom that simply mask attempts to control and dominate others , especially women , and to limit the freedom of lgbt people to simply live whole lives ."

this woman used the n-word publicly to refer to a black woman complaining about racial discrimination .
this woman likely was a lifelong racist who in her old age thought she could continue the same behaviour that would have been common in the 1950's without having the good sense to know that the 21st century would catch up and deal with her .
the article is clear: this woman was standing on a sidewalk when a driver killed her .

"here is another quote from jefferson: some men look at constitutions with sanctimonious reverence , and deem them like the ark of the covenant , too sacred to be touched ."
"they ascribe to the men of the preceding age a wisdom more than human , and suppose what they did to be beyond amendment laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed , more enlightened , as new discoveries are made , institutions must advance also , to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain forever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors ."
